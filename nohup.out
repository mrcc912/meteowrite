But with 2013 oil prices topping $100 per barrel, and reservoirs around the world confirming new discoveries every year, oil remains both available and profitable ‚Äî despite the increasingly extreme technological lengths oil companies are undertaking to recover it.Now, research out of Stanford University could give oil companies an even greater upper hand by improving recovery techniques and letting drillers more effectively monitor existing fields in the North Sea.Imagine an oil field like you would imagine a balloon filled up with air. If you were to stick a pin in the balloon, all the pressure from inside would send that air streaming out. Similarly, a well extracts oil by puncturing the subsurface. The resulting pressure imbalance squeezes the oil, just like the air in the balloon, up the well through tiny pores that act like pipelines. The downside is that sometimes the pressure from layers upon layers of sediment can completely close off fractures in the rock, and drillers have little way of predicting such a setback with active seismic tests commonly used today.‚ÄúMany fields worldwide have shown problems in the overburden,‚Äù or their ability to withstand the pressure compressing an oil reservoir, says Sascha Bussat, a Norwegain researcher for the energy company Statoil. At best, active seismic surveys can only gather information every six months. Boats must float out into the great, stormy, maritime expanse with guns full of compressed air, which blast sound miles deep into the seabed. By measuring the time it takes for the vibrations to reach the subsurface and bounce back to detectors on the ship, surveyors can estimate the best places to search for oil and monitor the effectiveness of drilling.The costs of these tests runs into the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, and it takes years of data analysis before companies can determine the best drilling prospects.But Sjoerd de Ridder, a Stanford University geophysics graduates student investigating oil extraction in the Norwegian corridor of the North Sea, aims to bridge the data disconnect presented by big-ticket, active seismic testing by offering a more affordable model. At the annual School of Earth Sciences Research Review in April, de Ridder explained that offshore platforms in Norway‚Äôs Valhall Field can continuously record fainter seismic waves naturally occurring at the ocean floor as water moves along the crust of the earth.Notably for oil companies, according to de Ridder, these passive, or ambient seismic tests could better pinpoint where and when expensive surveys should optimally be used. The value of de Ridder‚Äôs ambient seismic approach lies in harvesting data in real time and for almost no additional cost above normal operations. ‚ÄúThat makes any value equation good,‚Äù he says.British Petroleum (BP), the operator of Valhall Field, has been moving to drive ambient seismic testing research forward. When de Ridder began diving further into mapping Valhall‚Äôs oil deposits in 2008, scientists had known about ambient seismology for decades, but they hadn‚Äôt yet applied it to monitoring oil reserves. De Ridder spent the last summer in Norway where initial tests proved successful, and he expects that, within a year, the proper infrastructure will be in place to monitor seismic signals in the North Sea 24/7.As our energy requirements continue to outpace our abilities to harness alternative sources, de Ridder predicts that this virtually free information from ambient seismic technology will have an impact. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre headed for world where there‚Äôs still as much hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation as possible,‚Äù he says. In de Ridder‚Äôs eyes, that‚Äôs an industry that Norway can‚Äôt live without.‚ÄúNorway is definitely a country that floats on oil,‚Äù he notes. In 2009, the petroleum sector was responsible for 21 percent of Norway‚Äôs economy. Presently, however, the Norwegian government, which possesses drilling rights in the North Sea along with the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and Great Britain, is overrun with costly delays and declining productivity. Because oil companies can write off 78 percent of their losses on bad exploration or drilling investments, these obstacles are dealing direct blows to the country‚Äôs economic growth and welfare funding.Still, oil discoveries are keeping Norway in the game. The resources in Norway‚Äôs 2012 finds amount to an estimated 58 percent of last year‚Äôs total production. It‚Äôs a significant stage to possibly debut ambient seismic tests, with great rewards to be reaped from better reservoir monitoring.In an interview following the research seminar, de Ridder silently struggled to find a way to distill five years of research into one thought on the lasting impact of his work. He paused for almost 30 seconds before concluding: ‚ÄúThe major achievement would be that I show that there is a wealth of information that can be retrieved form ambient seismic noise that could be of interest to the oil industry.‚Äù De Ridder continued, ‚ÄúThere is a huge source of data out there that we‚Äôre not tapping into. That, I think, is key.‚Äù',

  body: '<strong>QUESTION: I read years ago that ethanol plants needed to be subsidized in order to make ‚Äúends meet.‚Äù Since then, how much has the efficiency of ethanol-producing technology improved? Is the industry now getting more energy out of the ethanol produced than put in? How dependent is this efficiency on the type of biofuel used (corn, grass, sugar cane)?</strong> <em>Asked by Hector Raynal, El Paso, Texas</em><a rel="attachment wp-att-6651" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/21/led-bulbs-are-the-best-lighting-choice/penipress-top_stanford-sage-logo_large-2/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6651" title="PeniPress Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PeniPress-Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large1-1024x249.png" alt="" height="107" width="442"></a><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The United States&nbsp;loves corn. We use it for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornproducts.com/" target="_blank">everything</a>, from Coca-Cola sweetener to cow feed to ‚Äúplastic‚Äù cup base. And we grow a lot of it: about 730 billion pounds in 2010*. On par with America‚Äôs love for corn is its oil addiction‚Äîand over the past 10 years we have combined these two great infatuations in the form of ethanol, a biofuel that can be mixed with gasoline to power cars and trucks. While the process of making corn ethanol involves simple fermentation and distillation‚Äînot unlike making whisky or vodka‚Äîthe impacts of moving nearly 126 billion pounds of corn off the table and into the tank are enormous, and infinitely more complex.Corn, like any plant, needs sunlight, soil and water to grow. In the United States, it gets myriad additional inputs: in 2005, farmers applied 10 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer to our nation‚Äôs corn, irrigated more than 80 percent of the cropland and sprayed about 170 million pounds of herbicides‚Äîand that‚Äôs while the plants were still in the field. Once the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen" target="_blank">Little Red Hen</a> is ready to harvest all of that corn, it needs to be picked, packaged and shipped off for processing and distribution.Every step in that process requires energy. The question is, can we get more energy&nbsp;<em>out</em> of corn ethanol that we have to put&nbsp;<em>in</em>? This is the&nbsp;<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/biofuels/biofuels-interactive" target="_blank">energy output ratio</a> you‚Äôre asking about. If the Hen sends the corn to be made into biofuel, she will get about 1.3 units of biofuel energy out for every unit of fossil fuel energy in. And unfortunately, that‚Äôs the lowest energy ratio out there for biofuels. For comparison, Brazil‚Äîthe world‚Äôs second largest biofuels producer after the United States‚Äîgets an output ratio of 2 from their sugar cane ethanol. Also, studies on net energy output of biofuels are convoluted and often hard to sift through: while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1552355771656v0/" target="_blank">some</a> say it takes more energy to produce biofuels than the fuel provides,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf" target="_blank">others</a> say just the opposite. We‚Äôll attempt to clarify the situation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html">Nitty Gritty</a>.While energy ratios give a valuable metric for comparison, judging the impacts of biofuels‚Äîand their ultimate value as a sustainable fuel source‚Äîis more complex than comparing energy outputs or piecing together&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201103/impact/essential.html">lifecycle analyses</a>. Corn ethanol has environmental, economic and social impacts that reach far beyond the gas tank. And by almost any analysis, those impacts make it a poor choice for fuel in the United States.One such negative impact is diverting corn from food to fuel: the 14 million acres of corn we used for biofuels in 2008 could have fed 26&nbsp;million cows to maturity, or have sustained as many as 100 million people for a year. Further, choosing to use that corn for fuel decreased the amount available as food on the international market and may have contributed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/ethanol_mandates_may_spike_food_prices_economists_warn" target="_blank">skyrocketing food prices</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=biofuels-bad-for-people-and-climate" target="_blank">increasing deforestation</a> rates in the Amazon.So with all of the harmful side effects, why doesn‚Äôt the Red Hen just keep the corn on the table and out of the tank? Even characters in fables are susceptible to economic incentives, evidently. With the help of decades of farm subsidies keeping inputs cheap, a tariff on foreign ethanol, 40 percent of production costs being covered by tax dollars, and government mandates for production, sending corn to the tank earns famers a lot more money. Is that really our primary goal from an alternative fuel source? Almost certainly not, so lets look elsewhere for fuel and leave the corn for the cola and cows.<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html"><strong>READ MORE: Life cycle assessments capture more of corn ethanol‚Äôs overarching impacts [Click through for the Nitty Gritty Answer]. </strong></a><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-5770" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/08/which-is-more-eco-friendly-real-or-artificial-christmas-trees/ask-sage-button/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="Ask SAGE button" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ask-SAGE-button.png" alt="" height="73" width="300"></a></strong>&nbsp;',

  body: 'Not long ago, petroleum was starting to seem like an outdated source for fuel, as global reserves diminished and concerns about climate change pushed the focus to alternatives. But with 2013 oil prices topping $100 per barrel, and reservoirs around the world confirming new discoveries every year, oil remains both available and profitable ‚Äî despite the increasingly extreme technological lengths oil companies are undertaking to recover it.Now, research out of Stanford University could give oil companies an even greater upper hand by improving recovery techniques and letting drillers more effectively monitor existing fields in the North Sea.Imagine an oil field like you would imagine a balloon filled up with air. If you were to stick a pin in the balloon, all the pressure from inside would send that air streaming out. Similarly, a well extracts oil by puncturing the subsurface. The resulting pressure imbalance squeezes the oil, just like the air in the balloon, up the well through tiny pores that act like pipelines. The downside is that sometimes the pressure from layers upon layers of sediment can completely close off fractures in the rock, and drillers have little way of predicting such a setback with active seismic tests commonly used today.‚ÄúMany fields worldwide have shown problems in the overburden,‚Äù or their ability to withstand the pressure compressing an oil reservoir, says Sascha Bussat, a Norwegain researcher for the energy company Statoil. At best, active seismic surveys can only gather information every six months. Boats must float out into the great, stormy, maritime expanse with guns full of compressed air, which blast sound miles deep into the seabed. By measuring the time it takes for the vibrations to reach the subsurface and bounce back to detectors on the ship, surveyors can estimate the best places to search for oil and monitor the effectiveness of drilling.The costs of these tests runs into the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars, and it takes years of data analysis before companies can determine the best drilling prospects.But Sjoerd de Ridder, a Stanford University geophysics graduates student investigating oil extraction in the Norwegian corridor of the North Sea, aims to bridge the data disconnect presented by big-ticket, active seismic testing by offering a more affordable model. At the annual School of Earth Sciences Research Review in April, de Ridder explained that offshore platforms in Norway‚Äôs Valhall Field can continuously record fainter seismic waves naturally occurring at the ocean floor as water moves along the crust of the earth.Notably for oil companies, according to de Ridder, these passive, or ambient seismic tests could better pinpoint where and when expensive surveys should optimally be used. The value of de Ridder‚Äôs ambient seismic approach lies in harvesting data in real time and for almost no additional cost above normal operations. ‚ÄúThat makes any value equation good,‚Äù he says.British Petroleum (BP), the operator of Valhall Field, has been moving to drive ambient seismic testing research forward. When de Ridder began diving further into mapping Valhall‚Äôs oil deposits in 2008, scientists had known about ambient seismology for decades, but they hadn‚Äôt yet applied it to monitoring oil reserves. De Ridder spent the last summer in Norway where initial tests proved successful, and he expects that, within a year, the proper infrastructure will be in place to monitor seismic signals in the North Sea 24/7.As our energy requirements continue to outpace our abilities to harness alternative sources, de Ridder predicts that this virtually free information from ambient seismic technology will have an impact. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre headed for world where there‚Äôs still as much hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation as possible,‚Äù he says. In de Ridder‚Äôs eyes, that‚Äôs an industry that Norway can‚Äôt live without.‚ÄúNorway is definitely a country that floats on oil,‚Äù he notes. In 2009, the petroleum sector was responsible for 21 percent of Norway‚Äôs economy. Presently, however, the Norwegian government, which possesses drilling rights in the North Sea along with the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and Great Britain, is overrun with costly delays and declining productivity. Because oil companies can write off 78 percent of their losses on bad exploration or drilling investments, these obstacles are dealing direct blows to the country‚Äôs economic growth and welfare funding.Still, oil discoveries are keeping Norway in the game. The resources in Norway‚Äôs 2012 finds amount to an estimated 58 percent of last year‚Äôs total production. It‚Äôs a significant stage to possibly debut ambient seismic tests, with great rewards to be reaped from better reservoir monitoring.In an interview following the research seminar, de Ridder silently struggled to find a way to distill five years of research into one thought on the lasting impact of his work. He paused for almost 30 seconds before concluding: ‚ÄúThe major achievement would be that I show that there is a wealth of information that can be retrieved form ambient seismic noise that could be of interest to the oil industry.‚Äù De Ridder continued, ‚ÄúThere is a huge source of data out there that we‚Äôre not tapping into. That, I think, is key.‚Äù',

Is the industry now getting more energy out of the ethanol produced than put in? How dependent is this efficiency on the type of biofuel used (corn, grass, sugar cane)?</strong> <em>Asked by Hector Raynal, El Paso, Texas</em><a rel="attachment wp-att-6651" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/21/led-bulbs-are-the-best-lighting-choice/penipress-top_stanford-sage-logo_large-2/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6651" title="PeniPress Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PeniPress-Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large1-1024x249.png" alt="" height="107" width="442"></a><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The United States&nbsp;loves corn. We use it for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornproducts.com/" target="_blank">everything</a>, from Coca-Cola sweetener to cow feed to ‚Äúplastic‚Äù cup base. And we grow a lot of it: about 730 billion pounds in 2010*. On par with America‚Äôs love for corn is its oil addiction‚Äîand over the past 10 years we have combined these two great infatuations in the form of ethanol, a biofuel that can be mixed with gasoline to power cars and trucks. While the process of making corn ethanol involves simple fermentation and distillation‚Äînot unlike making whisky or vodka‚Äîthe impacts of moving nearly 126 billion pounds of corn off the table and into the tank are enormous, and infinitely more complex.Corn, like any plant, needs sunlight, soil and water to grow. In the United States, it gets myriad additional inputs: in 2005, farmers applied 10 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer to our nation‚Äôs corn, irrigated more than 80 percent of the cropland and sprayed about 170 million pounds of herbicides‚Äîand that‚Äôs while the plants were still in the field. Once the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen" target="_blank">Little Red Hen</a> is ready to harvest all of that corn, it needs to be picked, packaged and shipped off for processing and distribution.Every step in that process requires energy. The question is, can we get more energy&nbsp;<em>out</em> of corn ethanol that we have to put&nbsp;<em>in</em>? This is the&nbsp;<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/biofuels/biofuels-interactive" target="_blank">energy output ratio</a> you‚Äôre asking about. If the Hen sends the corn to be made into biofuel, she will get about 1.3 units of biofuel energy out for every unit of fossil fuel energy in. And unfortunately, that‚Äôs the lowest energy ratio out there for biofuels. For comparison, Brazil‚Äîthe world‚Äôs second largest biofuels producer after the United States‚Äîgets an output ratio of 2 from their sugar cane ethanol. Also, studies on net energy output of biofuels are convoluted and often hard to sift through: while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1552355771656v0/" target="_blank">some</a> say it takes more energy to produce biofuels than the fuel provides,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf" target="_blank">others</a> say just the opposite. We‚Äôll attempt to clarify the situation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html">Nitty Gritty</a>.While energy ratios give a valuable metric for comparison, judging the impacts of biofuels‚Äîand their ultimate value as a sustainable fuel source‚Äîis more complex than comparing energy outputs or piecing together&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201103/impact/essential.html">lifecycle analyses</a>. Corn ethanol has environmental, economic and social impacts that reach far beyond the gas tank. And by almost any analysis, those impacts make it a poor choice for fuel in the United States.One such negative impact is diverting corn from food to fuel: the 14 million acres of corn we used for biofuels in 2008 could have fed 26&nbsp;million cows to maturity, or have sustained as many as 100 million people for a year. Further, choosing to use that corn for fuel decreased the amount available as food on the international market and may have contributed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/ethanol_mandates_may_spike_food_prices_economists_warn" target="_blank">skyrocketing food prices</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=biofuels-bad-for-people-and-climate" target="_blank">increasing deforestation</a> rates in the Amazon.So with all of the harmful side effects, why doesn‚Äôt the Red Hen just keep the corn on the table and out of the tank? Even characters in fables are susceptible to economic incentives, evidently. With the help of decades of farm subsidies keeping inputs cheap, a tariff on foreign ethanol, 40 percent of production costs being covered by tax dollars, and government mandates for production, sending corn to the tank earns famers a lot more money. Is that really our primary goal from an alternative fuel source? Almost certainly not, so lets look elsewhere for fuel and leave the corn for the cola and cows.<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html"><strong>READ MORE: Life cycle assessments capture more of corn ethanol‚Äôs overarching impacts [Click through for the Nitty Gritty Answer]. </strong></a><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-5770" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/08/which-is-more-eco-friendly-real-or-artificial-christmas-trees/ask-sage-button/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="Ask SAGE button" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ask-SAGE-button.png" alt="" height="73" width="300"></a></strong>&nbsp;',

How dependent is this efficiency on the type of biofuel used (corn, grass, sugar cane)?</strong> <em>Asked by Hector Raynal, El Paso, Texas</em><a rel="attachment wp-att-6651" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/21/led-bulbs-are-the-best-lighting-choice/penipress-top_stanford-sage-logo_large-2/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6651" title="PeniPress Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PeniPress-Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large1-1024x249.png" alt="" height="107" width="442"></a><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The United States&nbsp;loves corn. We use it for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornproducts.com/" target="_blank">everything</a>, from Coca-Cola sweetener to cow feed to ‚Äúplastic‚Äù cup base. And we grow a lot of it: about 730 billion pounds in 2010*. On par with America‚Äôs love for corn is its oil addiction‚Äîand over the past 10 years we have combined these two great infatuations in the form of ethanol, a biofuel that can be mixed with gasoline to power cars and trucks. While the process of making corn ethanol involves simple fermentation and distillation‚Äînot unlike making whisky or vodka‚Äîthe impacts of moving nearly 126 billion pounds of corn off the table and into the tank are enormous, and infinitely more complex.Corn, like any plant, needs sunlight, soil and water to grow. In the United States, it gets myriad additional inputs: in 2005, farmers applied 10 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer to our nation‚Äôs corn, irrigated more than 80 percent of the cropland and sprayed about 170 million pounds of herbicides‚Äîand that‚Äôs while the plants were still in the field. Once the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen" target="_blank">Little Red Hen</a> is ready to harvest all of that corn, it needs to be picked, packaged and shipped off for processing and distribution.Every step in that process requires energy. The question is, can we get more energy&nbsp;<em>out</em> of corn ethanol that we have to put&nbsp;<em>in</em>? This is the&nbsp;<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/biofuels/biofuels-interactive" target="_blank">energy output ratio</a> you‚Äôre asking about. If the Hen sends the corn to be made into biofuel, she will get about 1.3 units of biofuel energy out for every unit of fossil fuel energy in. And unfortunately, that‚Äôs the lowest energy ratio out there for biofuels. For comparison, Brazil‚Äîthe world‚Äôs second largest biofuels producer after the United States‚Äîgets an output ratio of 2 from their sugar cane ethanol. Also, studies on net energy output of biofuels are convoluted and often hard to sift through: while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1552355771656v0/" target="_blank">some</a> say it takes more energy to produce biofuels than the fuel provides,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf" target="_blank">others</a> say just the opposite. We‚Äôll attempt to clarify the situation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html">Nitty Gritty</a>.While energy ratios give a valuable metric for comparison, judging the impacts of biofuels‚Äîand their ultimate value as a sustainable fuel source‚Äîis more complex than comparing energy outputs or piecing together&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201103/impact/essential.html">lifecycle analyses</a>. Corn ethanol has environmental, economic and social impacts that reach far beyond the gas tank. And by almost any analysis, those impacts make it a poor choice for fuel in the United States.One such negative impact is diverting corn from food to fuel: the 14 million acres of corn we used for biofuels in 2008 could have fed 26&nbsp;million cows to maturity, or have sustained as many as 100 million people for a year. Further, choosing to use that corn for fuel decreased the amount available as food on the international market and may have contributed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/ethanol_mandates_may_spike_food_prices_economists_warn" target="_blank">skyrocketing food prices</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=biofuels-bad-for-people-and-climate" target="_blank">increasing deforestation</a> rates in the Amazon.So with all of the harmful side effects, why doesn‚Äôt the Red Hen just keep the corn on the table and out of the tank? Even characters in fables are susceptible to economic incentives, evidently. With the help of decades of farm subsidies keeping inputs cheap, a tariff on foreign ethanol, 40 percent of production costs being covered by tax dollars, and government mandates for production, sending corn to the tank earns famers a lot more money. Is that really our primary goal from an alternative fuel source? Almost certainly not, so lets look elsewhere for fuel and leave the corn for the cola and cows.<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html"><strong>READ MORE: Life cycle assessments capture more of corn ethanol‚Äôs overarching impacts [Click through for the Nitty Gritty Answer]. </strong></a><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-5770" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/08/which-is-more-eco-friendly-real-or-artificial-christmas-trees/ask-sage-button/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="Ask SAGE button" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ask-SAGE-button.png" alt="" height="73" width="300"></a></strong>&nbsp;',

  body: 'Lawsuits questioning the Santa Clara County Board of Education‚Äôs authority to exempt Rocketship Education from local land-use requirements for a new countywide charter school in San Jose‚Äôs Tamien neighborhood highlight deep community tensions over the proposed project.The board of education exempted elementary charter school company Rocketship Education from zoning requirements in January, allowing it to build a school near San Jose‚Äôs Tamien light-rail station. Rocketship had initially sought the exemption from San Jose Unified School District, since local districts can give them to charter schools, but the district rejected Rocketship‚Äôs request. ‚ÄúThe county board is leapfrogging the local board,‚Äù explained Tamien resident Brett Bymaster.Bymaster and San Jose Unified filed separate lawsuits challenging the board of education‚Äôs resolution to grant Rocketship a zoning exemption that would allow it to open a school on a 1.4-acre site next to the Tamien light-rail station. With lawsuits delaying construction of the school, which was scheduled to begin last month, Rocketship said that it‚Äôs considering temporary, alternate sites for its eighth campus. Rocketship Education is an elementary charter school company, meaning that it operates taxpayer-funded, privately run K-5 schools. Rocketship opens campuses in underserved communities like Tamien to ‚Äúclose the achievement gap‚Äù between children in low- and higher-income neighborhoods. Last year, 80 percent of students at each Rocketship campus earned math scores similar to students in the state‚Äôs ten most affluent school districts on the California Standards Test, according to Rocketship‚Äôs website.The development has deeply divided the Tamien-Washington community. &nbsp;Supporters of the new school tout it as a needed alternative to what they view as subpar San Jose Unified schools. Critics say that the company‚Äôs political and corporate clout has allowed it to proceed with the development without considering residents‚Äô input, and they worry that Rocketship‚Äôs business ties means that the company prioritizes investor needs. They would prefer a new middle school, arguing that their neighborhood has too many elementary schools. Others worry that the Tamien Rocketship will hurt enrollment and funding at Washington Elementary, a San Jose Unified school<ins cite="mailto:Melissa%20Pandika" datetime="2013-03-17T10:33"> </ins>located about a mile away.Bymaster and other residents recalled bitter fighting during community meetings between Washington parents and parents whose kids attend local Rocketship schools, such as Mateo Sheedy. Maria Marcelo, a Washington parent, recalled how Rocketship children would tell Washington students, ‚Äú‚ÄôRocketship, I‚Äôm the best!‚Äô and ‚Äú‚ÄòYou‚Äôre the loser, loser, loser, Washington loser.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄúThis is about providing&nbsp;families with a choice for&nbsp;free, high-quality education,‚Äù Jessica Garcia-Kohl, Rocketship‚Äôs <ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:16"></ins>director of community development<ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:16">,</ins> explained.&nbsp; ‚ÄúMany of the families, simply as a result of their address, are relegated to send their children to a low-performing school.‚Äù Public school districts zone students for different schools depending on where they live.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although parents can specify their preferred schools, districts place the most weight on where a family‚Äôs residence falls on the school boundary map.Tamien resident Blanca Carbajal said that she felt ‚Äúreally sad‚Äù when San Jose Unified didn‚Äôt allow her to enroll her six-year-old daughter in her top choice school due to district zoning laws. Although Carbajal lives across the street from Washington Elementary, she listed Willow Glen as her first choice, based on her observations as a Washington volunteer and Willow Glen employee.&nbsp; Carbajal didn‚Äôt get her second or third choices, either.‚ÄúI want a choice for an education for my kid,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the district‚Äôs choice for education for our kids, right?&nbsp; I was upset about that.&nbsp; And that was the same thing I think for a lot of people in the community.‚ÄùRocketship schools accept students from any area, and because they‚Äôre publicly funded, they offer free education<ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:19">,</ins> as do San Jose Unified schools.<ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:19"> </ins>Carbajal also opted for Rocketship Mateo Sheedy because of its high standardized test scores and extended school days, which last from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., allowing single mothers like herself to work during the day.Bymaster, whose son attends Washington, worries that Rocketship has prioritized profit over community needs. Rocketship has strong corporate ties, with high-profile donors that include Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who also serves on Rocketship‚Äôs National Strategy Board.&nbsp; Hastings poured $11 million into DreamBox Learning, a company that sells software to Rocketship for their computerized instruction.‚ÄúThe concern here is that we‚Äôre turning over a very key piece of land and control of our educational ecosystem to institutions which have no public accountability,‚Äù Bymaster wrote in an email to the San Jose Unified School District. ‚ÄúThese are all private corporations with boards that are privately appointed.‚ÄùRocketship‚Äôs corporate backing also gives it more political leverage, say critics, making it a formidable force for local districts and communities.The company has hired its own lobbyist, Erik Schoennauer, who, along with Rocketship board member Timothy Ranzetta, donated to PACs aimed at electing charter school supporters and ousting their opponents. Ranzetta‚Äôs donation of $10,000 ranked among the top charter<ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:21">-</ins>school PAC contributions during last year‚Äôs school board elections. San Jose Unified representative Paul Higgins said that San Jose Unified does not employ a lobbyist or make PAC contributions.Rocketship parents also offer a valuable political resource. The school system has a minimum 30-hour annual volunteer requirement for parents, which they can help meet by attending public meetings to support Rocketship. Critics point out that this could place added strain on parents, many of whom are single and/or working. ‚ÄúSchool leaders will work with parents at risk of not completing their hours to get engaged in a manner that is convenient and meaningful to them,‚Äù Garcia-Kohl said.Some Washington parents have criticized Rocketship‚Äôs <ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:22"></ins>recruiting tactics, usually from parent<ins cite="mailto:Melissa%20Pandika" datetime="2013-03-17T10:35">s</ins> who can list recruitment activities to fulfill their 30-hour volunteer requirement. Washington parent Jose Maldonado recalled when Rocketship called him several times. ‚ÄúI got angry and told them I hadn‚Äôt registered my children there, and I told them not to bother me anymore,‚Äù he said.&nbsp; ‚ÄúThey keep calling the house.‚Äù Maldonado then told Rocketship that his family felt comfortable at Washington. Other parents said that Rocketship parents set up registration sign-up tables across the street from Washington.Carbajal said that the recruiters aren‚Äôt pressuring parents, only informing them of the new school as another option. Recruiters don‚Äôt approach Washington parents, she explained, since they‚Äôve already decided to stick with the district public school. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone needs to come change our minds,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAs parents, we have the responsibility to choose what we want for our children.‚Äù Garcia-Kohl said that Rocketship has not actively recruited at Washington since last year and doesn‚Äôt intend do so this year.She added that Rocketship has decided to build a school on the Tamien<ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:24"> </ins>site in response to ‚Äúsufficient demand for a school in this area‚Äù that‚Äôs ‚Äúfueled by parents‚Äô desire to have high-performing, individualized instruction.‚Äù But last September, Washington parents flooded the county school board with over 50 letters requesting that the school board open a middle school at the site, pointing out that the neighborhood has enough elementary schools. &nbsp;With the new Rocketship campus, four elementary schools would be located within a ten-block radius of each other. Two of the existing schools are Rocketship campuses‚ÄîMateo Sheedy and Alma‚Äîless than a mile away from the Tamien site, although Garcia-Kohl pointed out that both have waitlists.The closest middle school is more than three miles away. Families that own cars typically reserve them for fathers to drive to and from work, leaving the often stay-at-home mothers to walk an hour one-way to drop off their children. Marcelo fears for her children‚Äôs safety, since they ride their bicycles to school. She said that they‚Äôve had multiple near misses with cars.Washington parents‚Äô letters also expressed concern that the new Rocketship school could drain enrollment and consequently, funding, from Washington.&nbsp; Parents praised Washington‚Äôs teachers and programs. The school has a number of student clubs, enrichment programs and parent support groups. Bilingual instruction allows the students to stay connected to their families and culture. Over 90 percent of Washington students are Latino.‚ÄúThe community has worked so hard with the district to improve that school,‚Äù San Jose Unified representative Paul Higgins said. ‚ÄúIt would really hurt them to lose more students to another school.‚Äù Washington‚Äôs Academic Performance Index score, based primarily on state standardized tests, rose from 730 to 798 from 2010 to 2011, out of a statewide target score of 800.&nbsp; (The state department of education hasn‚Äôt yet released 2012 index scores.)For many parents, the school provides a sense of community. Marcelo compared Washington to a ‚Äúbig house,‚Äù with parents, teachers and students like a ‚Äúbig family.‚Äù She noted that many parents spend the whole day on campus.Rocketship also has a variety of student groups, including a computer-programming<ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:30"> </ins>club. Teachers instruct students predominantly in English but infuse the curriculum with books reflecting student culture, Garcia-Kohl explained. The schools also offer a bilingual reading program.Garcia-Kohl maintains that Rocketship had ‚Äúno shortage of public meetings‚Äù about the Tamien development, adding that she met with Bymaster in his home when she began her role as community director last year.According to individual councilm<ins cite="mailto:Joel%20Brinkley" datetime="2013-03-11T12:31"></ins>ember calendars posted on the city website, members who voted to approve the Tamien Rocketship met with Rocketship but not community members who opposed the development. Council members who did meet with opponents voted against the plan, except Mayor Chuck Reed, who met with them but approved the development.Community members also feel frustrated by their lack of representation on the city council and county school board. The councilman for their district, Sam Liccardo, recused himself since Garcia-Kohl is his fianc√©e. Darcie Green, the county school board trustee for the neighborhood, abstained from voting after her appointment was deemed unlawful. Many Washington parents speak minimal English, making self-advocacy difficult.Some parents also wonder whether Rocketship‚Äôs system really will help foster sustainable, long-term success. Throughout the school day, Rocketship students switch between classroom instruction and computerized Learning Labs that adapt to their individual skill levels. Some dub the Learning Labs a ‚Äúdrill and kill‚Äù approach that occupies students while saving money on teachers. Rocketship also recruits heavily from Teach for America, a program that deploys college graduates to teach at underserved schools for two years. Critics say this creates a revolving door of non-credentialed teachers. Because they‚Äôre paid a starting salary, they cost less than traditional teachers.But Carbajal believes that schools also hold the key to fighting crime in her community. Since Rocketship began opening schools in the neighborhood, she‚Äôs noticed fewer kids standing idle at street corners and getting into trouble. Bymaster responded that most gangsters are middle school-aged and older. Rather than solving the community‚Äôs problems, he thinks that the new school has distracted attention from them. ‚ÄúWe have a drug problem, gang problem, prostitution,‚Äù he pointed out. ‚ÄúWe should be working on these things, and all our energy is going into this fight.‚ÄùUplifting Tamien will take more than building new schools, Bymaster added. ‚ÄúOne of the big fallacies we have right now in the conversation is the idea that it‚Äôs all about the kids, and that points us totally in the wrong direction,‚Äù he said. <ins cite="mailto:Melissa%20Pandika" datetime="2013-03-17T10:36"></ins>‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt close the gap unless we have a cohesive community. We have to transform all of those people and make education a high priority for all of them.&nbsp; That‚Äôs a far cry from test scores.&nbsp; You have to think big.‚Äù<object width="590" height="400" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/UzYdFEaY3K4&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UzYdFEaY3K4&amp;rel=0"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><param name="quality" value="high"></object><em>Correction: This article incorrectly reported that with the new Rocketship campus, four elementary schools would be located within a ten-mile radius of each other.&nbsp; They would actually be located within a ten-block radius of each other.</em>',
