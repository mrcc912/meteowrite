V"Sparks fly and ticket buyers are rewarded for plunking down hard-earned cash when Kennedy plays Florin.It's not only because No. 3 Kennedy and No. 5 Florin are two of the area's top girls basketball programs and keen Metro Conference rivals.They also have two of the area's most prolific players in Kennedy's Lynette Johnson and Florin's Daijah Joe-Smith. Between them, they have combined for 2,750 points and 1,742 rebounds as four-year varsity players.So Friday most eyes were on the two returning Bee All-Metro first-team players and friendly rivals when they met up in Greenhaven.It was a good night for Johnson, the 5-foot-9 forward/guard headed to Utah State on scholarship. She scored 25 points and grabbed six rebounds in leading the Cougars (13-3, 4-0) to a 54-44 win over the Panthers (10-4, 2-2).It was more of challenging night for the 5-8 Joe-Smith who injured her left non-shooting wrist in the third quarter but continued to gut it out. She had five points and seven rebounds.In playing in the Metro Conference the last three seasons, Kennedy coach Dave Parsh has watched Joe-Smith, a track sprinter, dominate opponents, with her slashing and rebounding.""We know she likes to attack the basket,"" Parsh said. ""So I was pleased we were able to do things defensively where she didn't get her normal looks.""Florin tried to do its best to disrupt the calm and cool Johnson and while body contact worked at times  she was only six of 20 from the field  she made 11 of 12 free throws.""She was so aggressive going to the basket and getting to the line,"" Parsh said. ""I was a little surprised because she wasn't feeling well earlier today.""Florin coach Larry Price has mixed emotions when playing against Johnson. He's watched Lynette grow up while coaching her older sister on an Amateur Athletic Union team.""It's interesting she's over here doing what she does, and we're over there doing what we do,"" Price said. ""But after all is said and done, it's a big hug. She's a great kid.""In Johnson's four seasons at Kennedy, the Cougars have gone 86-29. Kennedy won the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I title last March, beating Oak Ridge in the final at Sleep Train Arena, and then fell to Berkeley in the CIF Northern California championship game.When Johnson was a freshman, Kennedy lost to an Oak Ridge team that would go on to win the CIF State championship.Behind Joe-Smith, Florin has gone 69-30. While the Panthers haven't had quite the playoff success of Kennedy  the Panthers lost to state power St. Mary's of Stockton in the D-II semifinals and quarterfinals the last two seasons  it was a totally different program before Joe-Smith arrived. Florin was 3-45 in the previous two seasons."\u000a

V"NEWPORT, R.I.  If the Crawley family of ""Downton Abbey"" were American, they'd summer at Newport.The stateside success of the British period drama about post-Edwardian aristocrats and their live-in help has piqued interest in the life of servants in the Gilded Age mansions of the seaside city.(Season 3 ended last Sunday, but the show is still available on Xfinity On Demand and Netflix; all seasons on DVD.)The nation's wealthiest families built Newport ""cottages"" in the 19th and early 20th centuries and would move their households here  servants, silver and all  from New York and elsewhere in the summer to enjoy the ocean breezes and society scene.Just as the Downton servants develop relationships downstairs  think the frustrated love triangle of kitchen maids Daisy and Ivy with footman Alfred  servants in Newport carried on a lively social scene of their own. Many of their stories have begun to emerge after digging by researchers at the Newport Preservation Society, which owns several mansions. Newly discovered photographs, documents and family histories have inspired the creation of a tour about servants in one of Newport's most picturesque houses, The Elms, which has become one of the society's most popular tours.Many mansions have been open to the public for decades, but with a focus on the wealthy families who lived there. Newport's grandest mansion, The Breakers, in recent years incorporated some information about servant life into its audio tour. But the new guided tour at The Elms centers squarely on servants and allows visitors into rarely seen parts of the mansion, including servants' quarters, the kitchen and the massive boiler room, where coal would be brought in through a tunnel that goes under the garden wall.Meg A. Watt, a ""Downton"" fan from Stroudsburg, Pa., took the tour last spring, not long after it started. The owners' side of the house is opulent with marble and gold. Just steps away, hidden behind doors, are plain hallways and rooms for use by the servants, she said. ""It gives you a completely different perspective,"" Watt said.The Crawleys' own American grandmama, played by Shirley MacLaine, owns homes in New York and Newport. The city is mentioned on the show from time to time, including by Lady Mary Crawley, who earlier in the series considers fleeing to America to wait out a scandal involving the death of a Turkish diplomat in her bed. ""It'll be dull but not uncomfortable,"" she says to her lady's maid, Anna, who asks to come with her.They end up staying at Downton Abbey. But if they had gone to Newport, they might have found a house much like The Elms.Completed in 1901, it was built as a summer home for Edward Julius Berwind, a coal magnate, and his wife. It was the first home in Newport that was completely electrified, boasted modern amenities such as an ice maker and telephone, and was even featured on the cover of Scientific American. The Elms was used as a residence until 1961.The tour begins at the servants' entrance, which is covered by an arbor and therefore hidden from view so residents upstairs wouldn't see deliveries. The guide then leads people up five flights of stairs to the servants' quarters, leading visitors to wonder how someone like Downton's war-wounded Mr. Bates could manage such exertion several times a day. (An elevator is now available for those who need it.) One servant's bedroom is furnished as it might have been at the time. Another displays census records that show the names, occupations and countries of birth of the Berwind household's domestic staff: around a dozen maids, footmen and others from countries as varied as England, France, Germany and Sweden, a difference from the servants at Downton, who are mostly English, save a few including the Scottish housekeeper, Mrs. Hughes, and Irish chauffeur turned son-in-law, Tom Branson.Another includes the story of the dismissal of the entire staff in 1902 after they asked for more time off, said John Tschirch, director of museum affairs at the mansions, who did much of the research on which the tour is based. The Berwinds replaced them with new servants brought up from New York.Other bedrooms display photos of servants, as well as journals and other documents, many provided by servants' descendants. One shows a maid standing next to a rocking chair on the home's roof, which was a de facto porch for the staff. In the window next to her are flowers in pots.In another photo, the Berwind household's longtime butler Ernest Birch, who married the cook, sits on a chair outside the mansion surrounded by footmen. One, much like Downton's footman-turned-valet-turned-assistant butler Thomas, seems to be throwing a little attitude.Census records from 1895 show that around 10 percent of the population in Newport was domestic servants. Tschirch said staff would have ""kitchen ratchets,"" parties in the kitchens of the different mansions, with food galore.""That's where all the gossip was,"" he said. ""You think of a social summer resort, the stories the servants could tell about each other, the people in town, the fashion.""Much of the information has come from servants' relatives who heard the Preservation Society wanted to hear from anyone who had lived or visited there, not just the owners. Tschirch said all kinds of family lore has surfaced, including a story about the cook, Mrs. Birch, whose finger was clawed by a lobster and had to be removed.They're still looking for more stories, he said.""The descendants,"" Tschirch said, ""are beginning to feel that these houses are part of their family histories, too.""THE ELMS SERVANT LIFE TOURInformation: Adults, $15; ages 6-17, $5.

V"Make no mistake, Kendal Nielsen, Londeen Mccovery and Basil Okoroike are fierce competitors and nationally ranked track and field athletes.So they weren't about to do cartwheels after finishing second in Thursday's Sac-Joaquin Section Masters championships at Elk Grove High School.But the trio turned in strong marks in their respective events to earn trips to next weekend's CIF state championships in Clovis.They offered only kudos to their rivals who earned the gold.""It's a friendly sport,"" said Mccovery, a senior at Cosumnes Oaks who placed second in the boys high jump to Oakdale's Manuel Hernandez. Mccovery cleared six feet, seven inches and Hernandez 6-9. ""Naturally, you to want win,"" Mccovery said. ""But there's a camaraderie and respect, too.""That's why Mccovery pulled for Hernandez when he tried unsuccessfully to clear 6-11, which would have moved him into a tie for second in the state.Hernandez and Mccovery are fourth in the state and 49th nationally with personal bests of 6-9, both established at the Sacramento Meet of Champions on April 28 when Hernandez won on jumps.""I still have one more meet to catch him,"" Mccovery said. ""My goal is to clear 7 feet.""Bear River's Nielsen, a senior ranked No. 7 in California and No. 14 nationally in the girls triple jump, came close to equaling her season best of 39-5. She jumped 39-4 1/2.But her respected rival, Tokay's Jannell Hadnot, turned in a PR of 39-8 1/4.""Jannell has really improved,"" Nielsen said of the junior. ""It's good having someone to push me, and the neat thing today is that everyone was real supportive of each other. There were girls PRing and hugging each other. It's nice having that friendly competition.""Okoroike, a senior at Rio Americano, could relate to Nielsen. He, too, barely missed equaling his personal best of 47-5 in the boys triple jump with a 47-4 1/2. Merrill West of Tracy's Deon Pinder jumped 47-11 1/4 to win.""You always want to be first, but I've competed against (Deon) at a lot of meets, and whoever wins, you are going to be happy for him,"" said Okoroike, also a football and basketball standout at Rio Americano.""That's what makes track a great sport. All these schools come together and click. It's like a family out here.""In other highlights from the six field event finals: Foothill's Lawre'll Dobbins beat Rocklin's Leah Carter in jumps to win her third consecutive Masters high jump championship. Both competitors cleared 5-5. Jesuit junior Austin White won the boys shot put with a toss of 55-6, while Cordova sophomore Monique Newton placed first in the girls discus with a heave of 131-1."\u000a

V"Today is Senior Ditch Day at Davis High School, meaning those closing in on graduation generally play hooky and go hang out at, say, the library for kicks and giggles.Rest assured, the seniors for the Blue Devils baseball team will be in the front row of classes with their minds on the urgency of today's engagement against rival Franklin of Elk Grove.With Ben Eckels dueling Elway Santistevan in a terrific, fast-paced pitching duel, Davis beat Vacaville 2-1 in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division I North losers' bracket final at blustery Sacramento City College on Thursday night.Davis must beat Franklin twice at Sac City in order to claim the program's third North title since 2001, all under coach Dan Ariola. The veteran Blue Devils skipper was brimming with confidence after the Eckels' latest gem. Ariola raved about Eckels (7-2) and the amount of arms the Blue Devils still have to challenge well-rested Franklin, the lone unbeaten team in this large-school event. Relying on his fastball and slider, Eckels allowed four hits and struck out 11, giving him 23 strikeouts in two dominating performances this postseason.Santistevan, who beat Jesuit 3-2 in a playoff opener, struck out four and allowed two hits. The first one was a towering fly ball by Eckels in the first inning to right field that got moved around by the wind and dropped for a triple, scoring Bobby Young for a 2-0 lead. Young's RBI groundout scored George Hatamiya.""I love it,"" a grinning Eckels said of his performance, his team's drive and the Blue Devils' chances. ""We're going to play two games (today). And we're all going to school (today).""Rams waiting  St. Mary's of Stockton awaits the winner of the D-I North after beating Buhach Colony of Atwater 9-1 at Pacific to clinch the South on Wednesday.

V"Glenn Casale has an international directing career that seems to have only two gears: overdrive and off.Mostly the California Musical Theatre artistic director bounces from one project to another, whether it's directing in Europe for Disney Theatricals or helming all but one Music Circus show here last summer. Not too surprisingly, for a couple months at the end of the year Casale ""hibernates,"" getting ready for the spring. At the end of January he jumps back into the fray, overseeing 10 weeks of auditions and callbacks with hundreds of actors in New York and Los Angeles as he casts the 2013 Music Circus season. That season will be announced Jan. 20.Casale's already done his portion of the heavy lifting for ""Peter Pan,"" a production starring Cathy Rigby, which comes this week to the Community Center Theater. Casale has directed Rigby's ""Pan"" productions since 1997, and the show has become a mini-franchise for McCoy Rigby Entertainment, the Southern California production company Rigby owns with her husband, Tom McCoy.The couple met here in Sacramento 31 years ago, when the former world-class gymnast-turned-actor made her professional theater debut playing Dorothy in a Music Circus production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and McCoy performed in the ensemble.Rigby was the first American woman to medal in the world gymnastics championships and was a two-time member of the U.S. Olympic team (1968 and 1972). McCoy Rigby Entertainment operates the La Mirada Theatre and a variety of theatrical entertainment. In 2004 Rigby came to Sacramento as Pan in what was at the time her ""farewell tour."" But she and McCoy took cues from performers like Cher and the Eagles that ""farewell"" doesn't mean necessarily mean ""goodbye"" for entertainers as much as it means ""see you next time."" ""People were bugging Tom about putting it back out,"" Casale said, sitting in his CMT office on J Street.""They kept saying 'We need to see her again' and honestly I feel she's better this time out than she's been in a while.""The new production opened in La Mirada in the spring and traveled to China in the fall. ""Jaded theater people were coming in saying 'She's still doing it at 60?' "" Casale said. ""And they walked away impressed.""When Casale asked Rigby if she wanted to cut anything before they re-staged the show, she told him she wanted to do all the flying she's always done and a little more.""She said, 'We've got to make sure they know I can do it,' she does flips now, and she never flipped before,"" Casale said.Besides the physicality of Peter Pan, Rigby also digs deep into the psychology of the character and what writer J.M. Barrie was doing in the story.""She is totally, fully immersed in that character, she knows it on so many levels,"" Casale said. Casale's relationship with Rigby is just one of many he deftly manages that are professional in nature but personal in depth and loyalty. This summer the legendary Shirley Jones and her son Patrick Cassidy performed at the Music Circus because of their long-held respect for Casale. Jones called Casale ""a wonderful director"" whom she felt ""very close to.""Gary Beach who originated the role of the flamboyantly gay Roger DeBris, ""the worst director to have ever lived"" for the Broadway production ""The Producers,"" routinely turns down regional offers to play DeBris, but he did in the 2010 Casale-directed Music Circus production. At the time Beach said, ""I'd only do it for Glenn."" There's more than friendship and sentimentality at work, though, in Casale's connections. As he remarked while directing ""Music Man"" this summer, ""People know I'll make sure they're taken care of and when we go to work I'll be prepared.""For Disney he has productions of ""The Little Mermaid"" running in Amsterdam and Moscow, and he'll put it up in Japan this spring. His ""Beauty and the Beast"" has been hugely successful in Spain.""It was big hit there in Madrid and Barcelona,"" Casale said. ""Now we've reduced the set so we can tour it to all the provinces for another year and a half. It's getting 95 percent audience capacity over there.""Casale appreciates his career and work with a sense of wonder while energetically approaching each assignment.""I think I'm so lucky I can work like this, which is always the first thing,"" he said. ""When I get to go into these new theaters in new places, different countries, I go in and think 'Wow, I can really create in here.'

V"GULFPORT -- NOAA officials called a national media briefing Thursday and said that the BP oil spill could have played a role in the high number of dolphin deaths in the northern Gulf since 2010.But they said further testing is needed to draw any conclusions.NOAA called the briefing to let the public know that five of the 580 dolphins discovered dead, including some of the fetuses, died from a marine version of a bacteria that kills goats, sheep, cattle, pigs, elk and dogs. Three fetuses and two adult bottlenose dolphin were found to have the bacteria brucella in their lungs or brains. Teri Rowles, NOAAs lead marine mammal veterinarian and coordinator for the national stranding response, said she knows of no other case where there has been a high mortality rate with brucella in dolphins.Earlier this year, before the normal birthing season, dolphin fetuses were washing ashore along Mississippi and Alabama beaches in record numbers.We believe these five dolphins died from brucellosis, she said. Die-offs from bacterial infections could be occurring because the bacterium has become more lethal, but they could also be occurring, or be more severe, because the dolphins are more susceptible to infection.Read the complete story at sunherald.com"\u000a

V"More than two months after the horrific mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, the Senate on Wednesday held its second hearing on legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips and to extend background checks to gun shows and private sales. But in spite of heated, and sometimes emotional, testimony, the measures supporters and opponents seem no closer to agreement on any of the core issues. Given the reality of gridlock in Congress, supporters of new gun legislation may not get everything they want, if they get anything at all.Since the first assault-weapons ban became law in 1994, most Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have steered clear of the issue.But a series of recent mass shootings emboldened supporters of gun restrictions to renew their push. For them, the last straw may have been the December shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which a gunman armed with an assault rifle killed 20 children and six adults.We are holding todays hearing because the massacre in Newtown was, sadly, not an anomaly, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the lead sponsor of the new bill, as she opened Wednesdays hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.One key witness was Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse, was among the young Newtown victims. Weeping, Heslin said no family should have to endure what he and the other victims families had had to go through.All 21 current co-sponsors of Feinsteins legislation are Democrats, and while some Republicans said they were willing to have a vote on the bill, theyve made it clear that they oppose it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., expressed a view shared by the National Rifle Association and many fellow Republicans that existing laws arent sufficiently enforced.""Im a bit frustrated that wed say one thing, but in the real world we do nothing to enforce laws on the books,"" he said.Tempers flared when Graham asked Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn whether police were arresting people whod failed background checks to buy guns. We dont chase paper, we chase armed criminals! Flynn thundered, generating applause from some members of the audience and a reprimand from Feinstein.Sen. Graham and I just got recognized for civility, she said, noting an award that both had received Tuesday. Lets keep this civil.Opponents have criticized Feinsteins proposals as feel-good measures that would do little to stop mass shootings but would hurt law-abiding gun owners. During the hearing, the NRA flooded Twitter with responses to the testimony, using the hashtag #StopFeinstein to respond to every point.When was the last time you heard anyone who survived a gunfight say they wish they had less rounds of ammo available, one gun control opponent tweeted.Criminals already beat the background check system by having straw purchasers buy guns for them, another tweet said.At the hearing, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the Justice Department had an abysmal record of prosecuting gun crimes. John Walsh, the U.S. attorney in Denver, said he strongly disagreed. Walsh said Justice Department employees worked many sleepless nights. Walsh said that 1 out of 5 cases brought in Colorado involved firearms and his office went after the worst of the worst, but lacked the resources to prosecute every gun case.Still, he said that as many as 80,000 people were rejected for gun purchases last year through background checks. Thats a record of success, he said. We should be proud of that.Vice President Joe Biden asked a gathering of state attorneys general Wednesday in Washington for their help in getting the measures through Congress.""There will be a moral price, as well as a political price, to be paid for inaction,"" he said.He hailed the Democratic primary victory Tuesday night of Robin Kelly, a former Illinois state representative whos running for a vacant seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Her campaign received a $2.2 million donation from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a leading supporter of new gun restrictions, while the NRA backed her chief opponent.""Voters sent a message last night, not just to the NRA, but to politicians around the country, said the vice president, whos played a leading role in the White House effort to push for gun restrictions in the wake of Newtown.Bloomberg said after a meeting with Biden at the White House that he was pleased with the efforts the administration was making in trying to urge Congress to act.""I walked away just thoroughly convinced that he and the president and this whole administration are committed, committed as you can possibly be, to help end the scourge of gun violence,"" the mayor said.Earlier, Bloomberg said hed met with four senators: Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Mark Kirk of Illinois and Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader. ""I did walk away thinking that while none of them made a specific commitment, Bloomberg said, I walked away comfortable that they understand the issue and that they will be there.""

V"A Sacramento County animal control officer went to a Galt home Wednesday afternoon to tend to cats and dogs left behind by an evicted resident. The home was supposed to be empty.But when the officer and a bank official approached, a shotgun blast exploded through the front door, killing the animal control officer and prompting a lengthy standoff with police from across the county.By late Wednesday, authorities had not identified the slain officer. However they named the suspected shooter as 65-year-old Joseph Francis Corey, who, until Tuesday, lived at the First Street home where the shooting occurred. As of press time, he remained inside the home, refusing to surrender.Public records indicate that Corey owned the home from 2006 until it was taken over by a bank in 2011. He remained there until he was evicted Tuesday.What drove Corey to the violence alleged by authorities is not known. Public records and information from police, however, indicate the foreclosure was just one in a series of financial troubles the man suffered in recent years.Sacramento County Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Ramos  speaking on behalf of at least five law enforcement agencies at the scene  said a deputy accompanied bank officials to the home Tuesday, as is standard practice during evictions.Corey was cooperative, even as the locks were changed, Ramos said. Officials last saw him gathering up personal belongings outside.When a bank official returned Wednesday, Ramos said, the animal control officer came along to tend to the animals  Corey had lamented he had nowhere to take them upon eviction.They never even saw the shooter; the front door never opened. The blast hit the officer in the torso and grazed the bank official, who suffered a ""superficial wound,"" Ramos said.The bank official ran to the street and flagged down a nearby Galt police volunteer, who dragged the officer away from the house. Paramedics attempted to revive him, but could not. He was pronounced dead at the scene.The shooting drew a massive response: As many as 50 officers from at least four local law enforcement agencies and three SWAT teams responded to a Galt police call for mutual aid.Believing the shooter to have retreated inside, police put up a perimeter around the house and began evacuating neighbors and a nearby preschool, a process that wasn't complete until almost 6 p.m.Officers tried to clear almost 20 homes in the area, but found only about a half-dozen occupied, Ramos said. An evacuation center was opened at a nearby community hall.Early in the evening, officers began using a megaphone, asking the suspect to answer their phone calls. Eventually, they had two brief conversations and confirmed that Corey was the suspect inside. Ramos said officers conveyed that Corey was ""irritated"" and ""animated"" about the situationOfficers then began efforts to force Corey out, including using ""flash-bang"" devices. But he did not respond.The prolonged police activity and jarring news of the animal control officer's death rattled the quiet suburban neighborhood.""It's really scary. We don't usually see anything like this,"" said Jena Maxwell, whose son was evacuated from the nearby preschool. ""That is really sad.""Area resident Daniel Garcia expressed concern that an animal control officer  who does not carry a weapon  was sent to the house without proper backup.Even more stunned were employees of the county's Department of Animal Care and Regulation, which responds to roughly 1,600 calls a month on almost 1,000 square miles of county land.In Sacramento County, animal control officers are not peace officers and are not armed. They respond to calls ranging from cruelty and abuse to dog bites to animals in distress.The department's director, David Dickinson, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. One of his officers said she and her colleagues were in shock, but she was not ready to be interviewed.Efforts by The Bee to reach Corey's relatives also were not successful.According to public records, Corey filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005  listing less than $4,000 in assets, a fraction of his $26,000 in liabilities  and again earlier this year.The bankruptcy filings indicate Corey had few possessions and little income, coming only from disability payments of less than $2,000 a month. Among the possessions he listed in 2005 were a Ruger .22-caliber rifle and six Catahoulas, a breed of dog.The First Street home previously was owned by a family trust before moving to one of Corey's relatives. Corey took ownership in 2006.CitiBank foreclosed on the home last year, records indicate. Public records also show Corey had a contracting license in California, though it has expired. That license was associated with the business Corey Renovations Unlimited, which had the same address as Corey.He has no criminal history in Sacramento County, according to Superior Court records available online."\u000a

V"Perhaps the most intriguing local pick in this week's Major League Baseball draft is Shaq Thompson.Thompson, the Bee's 2011 football Player of the Year from Grant High School, returned to baseball this spring to play alongside friends, but the 6-foot-2, 225-pound recent graduate said he had no idea where he might get drafted  if at all.An outfielder known for his speed and arm, Thompson was selected in the 18th round by Boston. Thompson said he will sign with the Red Sox but added that he still plans to play football at Washington, where he signed a national letter of intent in February.""I'm definitely going to Washington, but I'll report to baseball first to see how I do,"" Thompson said. ""I think this is great. I'm surprised. I thought I might get drafted, but much later.""As much of a natural as Thompson is in football  he glides as a tailback and is a punishing hitter as a safety  baseball was a challenge this spring.Thompson didn't play the sport as a junior and played little as a sophomore (he competed in track and field, twice reaching the CIF State Track and Field Championships as a sprinter). Thompson batted .305 and had 18 hits and 17 strikeouts. Despite the strikeouts, scouts told Thompson and his coaches that they like his potential.""So many strike out and they throw their bat or their batting glove, or have a sour face, but not Shaq,"" Grant coach Danny Chavez said. ""He would jog off the field like a real leader, with no emotion. Not that he didn't care. He hates to fail, but he didn't crack. He didn't let anyone see that he was bothered.""How good can Thompson be in baseball?""I just know the kid has a phenomenal arm and all the speed in the world, and can track any ball down,"" Chavez said. ""He has that great athletic ability and great mental approach. And he's such a quality young man, so why not take a chance on putting him in your organization? This game is all about potential, and he's got amazing potential.""Said Thompson: ""I'm just glad I played baseball again because I realized how fun it is, how much I missed it. I know it's a game of failure and it is a hard game to adjust to. I'm looking forward to meeting new people in baseball, then it'll be football.""

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/08/03/4687901/lost-unconnected-and-loving-it.html,"ON THE PACIFIC CREST TRAIL, Ore.  Actually, that dateline isn't quite right. It shouldn't be ""on"" the Pacific Crest Trail, because my daughter and I drifted off the trail. We ended up completely lost in a wilderness of snow, mountains and forests. No phones. No email. No work. A perfect father-daughter bonding experience. The adventures began after my 14-year-old daughter and I started out on a 200-mile backpack along the Pacific Crest Trail last month. Ultralight backpacking is one of my family's summer rituals, but this time we ran into an unusually high snowpack for July. For the first 50 miles we managed to bound over 5-foot snowdrifts and stay on the trail. Then we hit higher elevations in the Three Sisters Wilderness, and later the Mount Jefferson Wilderness: The trail completely disappeared under many feet of snow that lasted for miles. We gave up on the trail and followed map and compass. Once, we were delighted to find footprints that we eagerly followed. Then the footprints became more distinct and we realized that they had toes. And claws.""Dad, I think that's a bear you're following."" So we returned to map and compass, scrambling up steep ridges and tumbling down snowy slopes, bounding across vast fields of boulders and lava, and finding patches of bare ground to camp on when darkness fell. For much of the way, we were mauled by the most bloodthirsty brutes of the American wilderness  not grizzly bears, but mosquitoes. My daughter had DEET repellent and a head net, but neither helped much. ""Look, Dad! I just counted! I have 49 mosquito bites on my forehead alone!"" This trip, even more than most backpacking slogs, was a reminder that we humans are mere bricks in a vast natural cathedral. As we tumbled in snow pits, as rain fell on us, we mused that we're not landlords of our planet, or even its prime tenants. We're just guests. In short, the wilderness humbled us, and that's why it is indispensable. In our modern society, we have structured the world to obey us; we can often use a keyboard or a remote to alter our surroundings. Yet all this gadgetry focused on our comfort doesn't always leave us more content or grounded. It is striking how often people who are feeling bewildered or troubled seek remedy in the wilderness. That's the point of the best-selling new book ""Wild,"" by Cheryl Strayed, about how she escaped from heroin and grief over her mother's death by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. ""Wild"" is a terrific yarn, opening with a moment in which Strayed loses one precious hiking boot over a precipice  and then angrily hurls the other after it. Over time, the forests tame her, providing free therapy and the setting for her maturation. Strayed's book has been successful, largely by word of mouth, partly because it reflects a truth we recognize. For decades, youth programs have found benefit in sending troubled adolescents to drink from wilderness streams and lap up truths about themselves. Outward Bound takes a similar path, for everyone from at-risk kids to returning veterans to corporate executives. Perhaps wilderness is an antidote to our postindustrial self-absorption. It's a place to be deflated, humbled and awed all at once. It's a window into a world larger than ourselves, one that doesn't respond to a remote. It's an Olympiad for all of us. Yet, increasingly, it's for only a tiny minority of us. Getting lost in the wild used to be routine for generations raised on hunting and fishing, yet those pastimes are becoming less common. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that the number of Americans who fish dropped by 15 percent between 1996 and 2006. In that same period, the number of hunters dropped by just over 10 percent. Likewise, the number of backcountry campers in our national parks has fallen by nearly 30 percent since 1979. Look, trudging uphill through mosquito swarms isn't for everyone. But unplugging long enough to encounter nature is less scary and more fortifying than people may expect. My daughter and I were never in any danger and eventually muddled through all 200 miles of our hike. After 10 exhausting, exhilarating days, we emerged from the woods  and my daughter was promptly telling her brothers tales of snow and misadventure that had them yearning for frostbite. To guarantee wilderness in the long run, we first need to ensure a constituency for it. Environmentalists focus on preserving wilderness, because that's the immediate priority, but they perhaps should be as energetic at getting young people to interact with it. We need more Americans working through their challenges, like Cheryl Strayed, by hurling boots off precipices. We need more schools and universities to offer classes on the wild, in the wild  with extra credit for students who get lost."\u000a

V"Ben Moroski still can't say why he used to cut himself. Even though the Davis native has written and performed a one-person play based on his self-mutilation, he can't reduce his reasons to a simple sentence, and in ""This Vicious Minute"" he doesn't try to. The play received a successful staging in Southern California, and now Moroski, 25, who attended Davis High and UC Davis, brings ""This Vicious Minute"" home for the first time in a limited two-week run starting Wednesday at Sacramento's Ooley Theatre.Though not exactly a neophyte when it comes to writing or performing, Moroski downplayed his theatrical background in a recent telephone interview. ""I acted in high school and a little bit in college,"" he said. His rsum reads a bit longer. Moroski received a Kennedy Center Arts Award for playwriting while earning an undergraduate degree in English from UC Davis. He was also an acting apprentice with the well-known Williamstown Theatre Festival in New York and previously performed locally at Sacramento City College and on other Sacramento stages.The idea of writing about his self-mutilation developed last year in one of Moroski's treatment groups, but the inspiration for a one-person show was planted much earlier. While he was in high school, Ben's father, Mike Moroski, took him to see old friend Bo Eason perform his one-man play ""Runt of Litter,"" about growing up in a competitive football playing family. The elder Moroski and Eason were teammates on the Houston Oilers in 1985, during quarterback Moroski's eight-year pro football career, which ended with the San Francisco 49ers in 1986. Moroski had earlier been a football standout at UC Davis before becoming a long-time coach there (Full disclosure: I played on an intramural basketball team with Mike Moroski during one year at UC Davis).The Eason play made a lasting impression on the younger Moroski, who saw it three times in a two-year period.""I didn't even know what a one-person show would consist of,"" Moroski said. ""I was blown away and it's been in the back of my mind ever since.""Moroski decided to write a one-person play last year while in a Los Angeles self-injury treatment group called The Action Workshop. Group participants were encouraged to set goals for themselves whether treatment-related or not. ""I wrote fictional stuff and people were lukewarm to it,"" Moroski said.He was then pushed to write more personally, specifically about his cutting and self-injury. ""I was hesitant; I just wasn't sure there was anything interesting there.""When Moroski read his autobiographical material at a staged reading, the response was so positive he decided to develop it further and perform the piece at the Hollywood Fringe Theater Festival this past May, where it received a Best of Fringe award.""I bum-rushed it and got the show ready. It's taken off from there,"" Moroski said.The biggest challenge of the play was dealing with the question of why he started cutting himself. He found no easy answers.""It's still kind of murky for me,"" Moroski said.He began cutting when he was 18 and a senior in high school. College was looming and social pressures seemed overwhelming to him.""I grew up with a really, really conservative Christian upbringing, a lot of guilt and shame-based ideology,"" Moroski said. ""I felt myself pushing against the constraints that were being laid on me and I didn't know how to cope with that; cutting was one way I found."" He said the cutting had a temporary calming effect on him. But the effect didn't last long and so the cutting became a repetitive behavior. Moroski took the title of his play from a line in a poem by Vera Pavlova in her collection ""If There Is Something To Desire.""""The title refers to those minutes that we all face in life where we feel everything crashing in on us and we crave escape or release or salvation or just peace. It's what we choose to do in those moments that is essentially important,"" Moroski wrote in an email.Moroski has an acute awareness of the solo theater's self-indulgent pitfalls and seems determined to steer clear of them.""I've seen a lot of one- person shows over the years, and to be frank I don't particularly care for them, and here I am doing one,"" Moroski said. ""I didn't want to do my therapy in front of an audience.""Instead, he said, he bases the work in the concept of theater as community and a place where people come together to share stories.""It does not make me special to be the one up on stage telling the story,"" he said. ""My goal is that we're all on a level playing field and that my story validates your story.""THIS VICIOUS MINUTEWhat: KOLT Run Creations presents writer and actor Ben Moroski performing his one-man play about his struggles with self-injury.When: 8 p.m. Wednesdays-Saturdays through March 9.

V"For an actor, nothing beats an Oscar. Unless it's multiple Oscars.Winning multiple acting Academy Awards has proved a rare-enough feat during the awards' 84-year history that Katharine Hepburn's four acting awards have been the gold standard for more than 30 years. Only four other people  Ingrid Bergman, Walter Brennan, Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep  have won three.The latter category likely will change at tonight's Oscars, starting at 5:30 p.m. on Channel 10 (KXTV; coverage starts at 4 p.m.). Nominees Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field (""Lincoln""), Denzel Washington (""Flight"") and Robert De Niro (""Silver Linings Playbook"") will vie for their third Academy Awards, with Day-Lewis, previously honored for ""My Left Foot"" and ""There Will Be Blood,"" almost certain to win.Day-Lewis' presence in his category gives Washington, 58, winner of a supporting-actor Oscar for ""Glory"" and a lead-actor statuette for ""Training Day,"" little chance of winning tonight for his lead performance as a pilot with crash-landing and drinking problems.Field's supporting-actress category also looks like a lock for someone else. Her fierce performance as Mary Todd Lincoln has run second throughout the awards season to Anne Hathaway's heart-rending work as Fantine in ""Les Misrables.""Yet Oscar history tells us not to count out Field. She won both times she previously was nominated  for ""Norma Rae"" and ""Places in the Heart"" (the ""You like me!"" win).De Niro, 69, winner of a supporting-actor Oscar for ""The Godfather: Part II"" and lead-actor Oscar for ""Raging Bull,"" enters a tight supporting race with Tommy Lee Jones (nominated for his performance as congressman Thaddeus Stevens in ""Lincoln"") tonight. But De Niro is the sentimental favorite. After years of subpar films and performances, he delivers a complex, sympathetic performance as the football-obsessed dad in ""Playbook.""If De Niro wins, his three awards will have come, like those of all current three-peaters, for lead and supporting roles. If Day-Lewis wins tonight, by contrast, he will be the only three-time winner with all lead-acting Oscars. (Hepburn's four Oscars all were for leads).Day-Lewis, 55, easily could win another Oscar after tonight's because he seems to take only roles that are catnip to Oscar voters. There are no ""Analyze Thats"" or ""Mamma Mias"" or ""Man on Fires"" on his rsum. Another lead Oscar would match Hepburn's four-Oscar record. And if we want to get technical about it  and let's do, since its Oscar day and we're discussing trivia  a fourth lead- actor Oscar for Day-Lewis would actually best Hepburn's four lead Oscars, because she shared her Oscar for 1968's ""The Lion in Winter"" with Barbra Streisand (""Funny Girl"").Directors' division If heavy favorite Steven Spielberg wins his third directing Oscar tonight for ""Lincoln,"" he will join a group even more rarefied than the acting three-peat group.A director with three Oscars enters a land of giants with just three other residents  John Ford, who leads all directing winners with four Oscars, and William Wyler and Frank Capra, both three-time winners. The last time a director reached the three-Oscar benchmark was 1960, when Wyler won for ""Ben-Hur.""Wyler's other directing Oscars were for ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and ""Mrs. Miniver."" Ford won for ""The Informer,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" ""How Green Was My Valley"" and ""The Quiet Man,"" and Capra for ""It Happened One Night,"" ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" and ""You Can't Take It With You.""Spielberg, 66, won his previous directing Oscars for ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" That he might join the three-peat pantheon with ""Lincoln,"" which does not rank among his best movies, makes you wish the Academy would go back in time to honor his direction of ""Jaws"" instead. (It's a film for which he wasn't even nominated.)The quiet perennial Amy Adams is assured and chilling as a cult leader's calculating wife in ""The Master."" More extra- ordinary, however, is that the performance earned Adams her fourth supporting-actress nod in seven years. The first three were for ""Junebug,"" ""Doubt"" and ""The Fighter."" (She also deserved but did not receive a lead-actress nomination for ""Enchanted."")Adams has moved into 1980s Glenn Close territory (five Oscar nominations from 1983-89) with so many nods in such a short time and  unless Adams pulls out a big upset over Hathaway tonight  no wins. Adams also evokes Close in maintaining a low-key personal life and in not achieving movie stardom until her 30s.Close, 65, picked up another nomination last year for ""Albert Nobbs,"" but mostly does TV now and might not get more shots at winning an Oscar. But Adams keeps lining up possibilities.She will appear as Lois Lane in this summer's ""Man of Steel,"" a Superman movie unlikely to yield an Oscar nomination but likely to improve Adams' profile and choice of roles. Next comes ""Her,"" the new movie from director Spike Jonze (""Being John Malkovich."") Her juiciest project, though, is a planned biography of Janis Joplin.Nothing says ""Oscar bait"" more than a biopic of a charismatic, hugely talented, drug-addled and doomed rock star. Though Adams is not the first actress to spring to mind for the Joplin role, she can carry a tune (as she showed in ""Enchanted""), she shares Joplin's coloring and, at a youthful 38, looks the right age to play a legend who died at a hard-lived 27."\u000a

V"The former West Sacramento police officer accused of sexually assaulting women while on duty faces 35 criminal counts, including charges that he used his power as a peace officer to force his victims into sex acts, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday.Sergio Alvarez, 37, is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges today in Yolo Superior Court. As of Tuesday evening, he was being held in lieu of $29.3 million bail.According to West Sacramento police, Alvarez is accused of assaulting six women between the ages of 20 and 47 while on duty. The alleged attacks sometimes occurred inside his patrol car.The indictment, handed up by a grand jury assembled over the weekend to review the case, alleges that the assaults occurred between Oct. 1, 2011, and Sept. 23, 2012. It also notes that two of the victims were assaulted on more than one occasion.The indictment says little about the circumstances of the cases, but the charges themselves are clear. They include rape, sodomy, forced oral copulation and kidnapping  referring to Alvarez's alleged decision to move some of the victims to another location.Several of the Penal Code sections include language that the alleged assaults were committed ""by threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate, arrest or deport the victim or another.""Lt. Tod Sockman, a spokesman for West Sacramento police, said he could not discuss how the victims were contacted or how the alleged assaults came about. However, he noted that the women had similar accounts and that the cases generally followed a pattern.Sockman also declined to say whether some of the women  who police said ""frequented the West Capitol Avenue"" area  were prostitutes. In a news release issued Monday, police Chief Dan Drummond described the victims as ""vulnerable.""The allegations came to light Sept. 24, when one of the victims came into contact with another West Sacramento patrol officer. Department officials immediately opened criminal and administrative investigations, Sockman said, and Alvarez was put on paid administrative leave.Department officials also reached out to the Sacramento Police Department, which has more resources, to help expedite the case. Sockman said his agency has just seven detectives; Sacramento police dedicated two of theirs full time to the Alvarez case and took the lead in the investigation.""They did an amazing job,"" Sockman said of the Sacramento police detectives. ""I think those folks are top-notch.""Sockman said he did not know why five of the six victims did not come forward at the time of their assaults, but he said he believed the fact the suspect was a cop was a factor.""I imagine there's an element of distrust,"" he said. ""Would anybody believe them if they did come forward?""He also credited the detectives with finding the additional victims and persuading them to cooperate, even though some of them ""don't necessarily talk to police officers.""The grand jury returned the indictment Sunday, and Alvarez was arrested Monday. Department leaders also served him his termination papers that day.Alvarez had worked for the West Sacramento Police Department since 2007, most recently working as a patrol officer on the graveyard shift."\u000a

V"Local prosecutors have moved five life-term inmates from Sacramento County to the front of the line to possibly gain their releases from state prison under last year's passage of the Proposition 36 measure that softened California's ""three-strikes"" law.Larry Edward Bailey, 62, Kevin Lewis Holloway, 59, Daniel Leonard Anderson, 55, Victor Charles Harvey Jr., 50, and Aaron Chris Collins, 46, will appear before judges in Sacramento Superior Court next week for resentencing hearings.They would be the first Sacramento inmates released under Proposition 36 if the judges resentence them.After assessing records that included the history of the inmates' prison behavior, the District Attorney's Office has decided against opposing any of their releases, even though one of the offenders looking to be released  Holloway  has a voluntary manslaughter conviction on his record.""We see our role as telling the court whether there is evidence to establish that they are a danger to the community,"" Assistant Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Grippi said Tuesday. ""When we find evidence that the person is a danger to the community, we're going to make that clear to the court. In other instances, we would tell the court we did not find evidence of dangerousness.""Grippi said prosecutors did not find such evidence in the cases of the five inmates, including Holloway. The DA's determination then set the stage for next week's hearings where the final call still will rest with the judges.Holloway is scheduled to appear Monday before Judge Alan G. Perkins. Bailey, Collins and Anderson will appear Wednesday before Judge Lawrence G. Brown. Harvey's case will be heard Thursday by Brown.""It's a good day,"" Chief Assistant Public Defender Karen Flynn said, after receiving confirmation that prosecutors will not stand in the way of the inmates' releases. ""I just think it was the intent of the citizens of California to not lock up folks who don't commit serious or violent felonies. It's a correction of the law from 1994.""The five inmates seeking the resentencings next week had first been vetted by Flynn's office. A few inmates who filed on their own for new sentences have since been rejected by local judges.More than 70 percent of California voters approved the three-strikes law in the 1994 balloting. It held that any third felony conviction could qualify offenders for 25-to-life terms if they had two serious or violent priors.Voters again upheld the law in 2004 before deciding to change it last year with Proposition 36. Now, third felonies in most instances must also be for serious or violent convictions. Proposition 36 also contained a resentencing provision for inmates sentenced to life terms under the 1994 law if they were convicted on relatively minor third felonies. As many as 3,700 inmates qualify for the resentencing, including about 160 in Sacramento County.Since last year's passage of Proposition 36, a total of 93 life-term three-strikes prisoners have been released from custody at their resentencing hearings, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.Grippi said that when the voters put three strikes on the books in 1994, ""we followed the law,"" and that local prosecutors will do the same with Proposition 36.""There's no begrudging the law,"" he said. ""It is what it is. We'll do our job. There have been a lot of changes since 1994. One of them is that crime rates have dropped dramatically, violent crime in particular. And so people's attitudes about how long someone should be incarcerated have apparently changed. We accept that as the law, and we're going to follow it as we did back in 1994.""Among the five inmates scheduled for resentencing hearings next week, all have completed assorted education, work and drug treatment programs in prison.Each of them also had been sentenced to their 25-to-life terms for lighter-weight third convictions  Bailey for second-degree burglary and petty theft, Holloway for conspiracy to transport drugs, Anderson for possession of marijuana and methamphetamine, Harvey for possession of methamphetamine, and Collins for possession of marijuana in prison.The five inmates each have prior records that include at least two prior serious or violent convictions. In Holloway's case, the record includes a 1998 manslaughter, on which no details were available Tuesday. But he is still eligible for release under Proposition 36 unless the judge finds at his resentencing hearing Monday that he poses ""an unreasonable risk to public safety.""Holloway has been in prison since the manslaughter conviction and would have been released from prison had it not been for his 2006 three-strikes conviction. According to court records, his girlfriend was arrested with 36 grams of marijuana, 6.7 grams of heroin and 1.5 grams of cocaine secreted in a body cavity in a March 2003 visit to Folsom Prison.According to his resentencing petition, Holloway since 2006 has completed numerous drug programs, a father's program, education and anger management programs, and two religious and ministry programs ""He's eligible under the law,"" the DA's Grippi said. ""And we are balancing the commitment offense, the strikes, and all of his previous records, and in doing so, we could not find sufficient evidence to show he is an unreasonable risk of danger at this time."""\u000a

V"The lead cyclist guiding the fastest runners among 4,000 participating in Sunday's Urban Cow Half-Marathon made a wrong turn in Land Park, an error that added more than a half mile to the event, possibly affecting qualifying times for some runners.Race officials said the mistake affected 1,400 participants  those running in the first group hoping to run the flat, fast course in less than 2 hours or set personal bests.Shortly after the race ended, participants discussed the glitch on the race's Facebook site and in emails to The Bee. Many realized the glitch early on because they train with GPS devices and timers.""I figured it out pretty quickly,"" said Alex Nichols, a participant in the first wave. ""We went off course within the first mile. By Mile 2, the rumor was spreading through the crowd, because we knew we had gone too far. The second mile took me four minutes longer, so I kind of figured something was off.""Rich Hanna, a promoter with Capital Road Race Management in Sacramento, confirmed that the first-wave runners ran 13.74 miles, or 0.64 more than the half-marathon distance. Hanna said officials decided to make a blanket time adjustment for that group. The adjustment would not necessarily disqualify them from using this half-marathon from getting into other events, he said.""We've been doing this for eight years, and we've never had anything like this happen,"" Hanna said. ""We worked hard to put on a good race, and having everyone follow the correct course is numero uno for us. It's disappointing to more people than you imagine, but me more than anyone.""Hanna said the lead cyclist guiding the first runners made a wrong turn near the Sacramento Zoo in William Land Park in the early part of the run. The volunteer guide led the runners onto the 5-kilometer course, a route for recreational runners and walkers, including 980 on Sunday.""He made a major mistake, but what's done is done,"" said Hanna, who personally practiced the route with the guide in preparation for the run.""We are involved in 75 races a year throughout Northern California, and unfortunately, this has happened at one of our most high-profile events.""Hanna said organizers calculated the runners' per-mile pace based on their individual times, adding 0.64 of a mile to the total distance and adjusting their time to reflect the longer course. The new times were going to be posted Sunday night on the event's website, Hanna said. ""We're sensitive to the fact that people work really hard in training, and targeted this race for months out,"" Hanna said. ""There are no Olympians out here, but there's a battle in the pack, with people competing against others in their age group, or working toward personal goals.""Organizers said if any runner realized the mistake early and ran the correct race, they should notify organizers so their times won't be adjusted. Hanna doesn't believe the changed course affected any placement awards, as the winners all ran the extra distance. Alan Jackson of Los Gatos won the overall individual event with a time of 1 hour, 15 minutes and 50 seconds.The race, which cost entrants $65, benefits running programs in the Sacramento region, including many high school teams, and the American River Parkway Foundation. In all, nearly 5,000 participated in the half-marathon run and 5K event.Nichols said he was not using the race as a qualifying time for other events, and was about 20 minutes behind the leader, so the mishap didn't affect him negatively. He praised the Capital Road Race Management team and volunteers and their legacy of running good races.""Whatever happened is just flukey,"" he said. ""I understand for some, it may be their first experience, so they may be mad, but I would run one of their (CRRM's) races any day of the week. They just had a bad morning."""\u000a

V"Jessica Chastain, vying for the lead-actress Oscar at tonight's Academy Awards for her performance in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" seemed to come out of nowhere in 2011, appearing in several high-profile films, including ""The Help,"" for which she received her first Academy Award nomination. But she didn't come out of nowhere. She came out of prestigious New York acting school Juilliard, and before that, Sacramento. Before Chastain, 35, was busy making movies, she appeared on local stages and worked in area restaurants. She also attended El Camino High School and Sacramento City College.Here's a look at the evolution of the most successful actor with Sacramento ties since Tom Hanks: Chastain had key roles in an astonishing 12 films  in the past two years  or about twice as many as Jennifer Lawrence (""Silver Linings Playbook""), front-runner in the lead-actress category.  She won great notices as the long-suffering wife in ""Tree of Life"" and as an Israeli secret agent in ""The Debt,"" both from 2011. But her truly standout role that year was the one for which she was nominated for a supporting-actress Oscar  a sweet 1960s housewife who does not fit in with her judgmental neighbors in ""The Help."" Chastain recently completed a three-month Broadway revival of ""The Heiress,"" playing a monied, vulnerable young lady opposite Dan Stevens as the woman's possibly shady suitor. Stevens spent three years playing Matthew on ""Downton Abbey."" So you know that even if Chastain loses tonight, her Sunday night will be better than Stevens' was last Sunday. In the mid- to late- 1990s, Chastain appeared in several Sacramento productions, including ""Much Ado About Nothing"" at the Sacramento Shakespeare Festival. ""She was probably around 19, but she just got it,"" her ""Ado"" co-star John Lamb, now a regular at Sacramento's B Street Theatre, told The Bee in 2012. ""She was just one of those actors who was very intuitive."" Like a lot of aspiring actors, Chastain waited tables to make ends meet. In 1997, she worked at the Downtown Plaza's River City Brewing Co. with Adam Pechal, now co-owner and chef at Sacramento's Tuli Bistro.""It was ages ago, and we didn't work together for very long, maybe six months, but she made a strong impression,"" Pechal emailed about Chastain. ""As a restaurateur in the making, I always appreciated the talents of my co-workers and she certainly was good at her job."""\u000a

V"Chad Sweitzer ran into his football coach this week and reminded him of an earlier discussion.No overnight stays allowed in the faculty lounge.Sweitzer is the Kennedy High School principal with an enthusiastic equal in Matt Costa, the first-year Cougars coach who would back his motor home next to the end zone if it allowed him an earlier start to this reclamation project.He is applying polish to a program stained by scandal last fall  a fourth-quarter brawl with rival McClatchy that resulted in game forfeitures and player suspensions, and then the resignation of coach Henry Lusk when a photo surfaced on the Internet, showing him clad in a thong. Those were the low points to an otherwise dreadful 0-10 season.Sweitzer knew he needed a splash of a hire, understanding the culture of the football team can influence the student body. In any district in any region, good vibes from football can resonate. Sweitzer said he has a difference-maker in the 31-year-old Costa, who admits to being stimulated by the challenge ahead. The former athletic director at new Cristo Rey High and head coach at Mira Loma, Costa arrived at Kennedy in the spring with a mop and broom. He cleaned house. He removed previous assistant coaches. He jettisoned disgruntled players. Others left or quit. Of the 27 players on the current roster, only two remain from last season. New faces, new jerseys and a new offense.""From Day One, Costa has been a ray of sunshine for us,"" Sweitzer said. ""Other coaches in the area are blown away at the change in football here  the attitude, discipline, the intensity of the workouts.""Costa has opened the eyes of the kids here, which is fantastic. We need it. And we've also spoken about time management. I won't let Costa live here on campus. He has a personal life as well, so coach, and then go home.""Here's what Costa likes about his boss Sweitzer: commitment. Costa said he marveled at Sweitzer earlier this summer as he rode an ATV across the playing fields and student parking lot, spraying the weeds he couldn't yank out by hand.Kennedy is home for Sweitzer. He was a team-captain lineman on Kennedy's last playoff team in 1990. He played for Pete Scorza, the program's winningest coach who has been battling cancer.Costa said Kennedy is a ""sleeping giant."" The school has been a Sacramento City Unified School District academic powerhouse since opening in Greenhaven in 1968. There has been athletic success across the board, but football suffered in recent years, resulting in smaller rosters and lopsided losses. Costa, who is a special education teacher, is Kennedy's sixth coach since 2004. The Cougars have produced two winning seasons since 1990.Last year was the low point. Footage of the Kennedy-McClatchy fight made national news. The Lusk resignation brought more headlines and scorn.""We've got to let go of the past, and that's hard to do sometimes,"" said senior lineman Kenneth Eto. ""We have a coach in Mr. Costa who can change the program.""Ian Allison, a junior halfback and honors student, said: ""Football is what can help bring this school together even more. It's a great school, and we can help that by being a better football team.""In 2009, Costa guided Mira Loma to its second playoff berth since 1985, so miracles can happen. The coach said Kennedy's workouts have been spirited  in the weight room, conditioning drills in the gym and on the field.""I'm in love with this team,"" Costa said. ""They've taken a business approach to this thing. Their enthusiasm for playing football is unbelievable. It gets so loud in drills you can't even hear.""It's a good noise this time, the sound of healing and progress."\u000a

VSports>Run,http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/23/5005362/27000-jog-walk-or-push-strollers.html,"It's Sacramento's largest group exercise event, a chance for thousands to take to the streets for a charitable cause before piling on the calories. A crowd estimated at more than 27,000 runners, walkers and stroller-pushers traveled the streets of east Sacramento on Thursday for the 19th annual Run to Feed the Hungry. The race  perhaps the largest Thanksgiving run in the country  raised close to $900,000 for the Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services. As usual, the race field included a colorful mix of serious athletes in skimpy racing attire, mothers and fathers lugging strollers and more than a couple guys dressed as turkeys. Many said they have turned the race into an annual family tradition. Probably the fittest family on the course this day was the Mickle clan. Olivia Mickle, 21, was the top female runner in the 10-kilometer race, finishing just a shade above 35 minutes. She ran most of the race with her dad, Iain, who eased off near the finish to let his daughter break the tape alone in the spotlight.A Loretto High School grad, Olivia Mickle is a senior on the cross country and track teams at Brown University, where she holds the school's record in the 10K. But she said the Run to Feed the Hungry was particularly memorable because of the company.""I don't get to run in Sacramento much, and to come here and run with my dad was special,"" she said.And her dad, a local attorney and top masters runner?""What a thrill it was to run with my daughter and have her win,"" he said. ""What a great way to start Thanksgiving.""The Skarpaas family of Redwood City made the trip for the first time. They weren't quite as competitive, stopping at one point along the course for a doughnut given to them by a spectator. Then, with about 100 yards to go, little Knut Skarpaas, 3, hopped out of his stroller and ran the rest of the way.""This is such a nice thing for families,"" said his dad, whose name is also Knut.Blake Young, the president and chief executive officer of the food bank, said most of the race participants competed in the shorter 5-kilometer course  and most of those are walkers. The overall field also included large organized groups  500 from a Wells Fargo team and 500 parents, teachers and students from St. Francis High School  and was guided by an army of 650 volunteers.The event is by far the food bank's largest fundraiser, accounting for about 18 percent of the organization's budget. The money helps provide food, workforce development programs and healthy eating classes for 20,000 families every month.The race started in 1994 with about 700 runners. It has grown steadily over the years into one of the region's biggest traditions.""The sense of community and the compassion you see out here is humbling,"" Young said.That compassion is often sprinkled with humor. Take Jake Kelly-Strong and his buddy, Alex Nelson. Kelly-Strong was in a full turkey costume, and Nelson played the part of a running Pilgrim.""There are so many people out here having a good time,"" Nelson said. ""We just wanted to add a little something."""\u000a

V"Mount Rainier National Park will not open the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center this season if Congress and the Obama administration fail to reach a budget deal by March 1.The closure is among proposed cuts planned at 12 major national parks, according to documents released Wednesday by the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees.Mount Rainier faces a mandated cut of $604,000 in its annual operating budget should the sequestration budget cuts take place. Olympic National Parks budget would be cut by $639,000.Under sequestration, a 5 percent cut to the $2.2 billion remaining in the final seven months of the National Park Service budget would amount to $110 million, according to preliminary estimates by the coalition.While park managers have been planning for budget cuts for more than a year, Park Service Director Jon Jarvis in January ordered parks to develop specific proposals.Not opening the Ohanapecosh center, which is shuttered during the winter, would affect more than 85,000 visitors. With a 5 percent cut, the park would not have the funds to operate and maintain the small center in the parks southeast corner.Attempts on Wednesday to reach Mount Rainier managers to get further details were unsuccessful. They have previously been instructed not to discuss the potential cuts. Details of cuts at Olympic were not available.Congress might just as well put a big Keep Out sign at the entrance to Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Yosemite, the Cape Cod Seashore and every other iconic national park in the U.S., said coalition spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo, former superintendent of Colorado National Monument.Millions of Americans depend on national parks for their vacations and livelihood. Those Americans are being told that national parks dont count, that people who use national parks dont count and that people who live and work near national parks dont count."\u000a

V"The news, at first, was startling. Crime data released by West Sacramento police this week showed the city's violent and property crimes increased by 30 percent in 2012 from the previous year.On Wednesday, the West Sacramento Police Department notified The Bee that it had supplied the newspaper with erroneous data. While the crime rate was up, it increased by only 8 percent over 2011.Violent crimes increased 10 percent in 2012; property crimes rose 7 percent. In all, 1,681 crimes were reported in West Sacramento last year compared with 1,561 in 2011.Of the 1,681 crimes reported in 2012, 190 were classified as violent crimes, and 1,491 as property crimes, according to West Sacramento police.Chagrined police officials on Wednesday offered this explanation: The crime data West Sacramento police provided The Bee for 2011, which were compared with 2012's incidents, were ""way too low,"" said police spokesman Lt. Tod Sockman.The 2011 numbers that the department submitted to The Bee were notably lower than the figures the department submitted last year to the federal Department of Justice.Sockman said the police department initially ""ran a quick search through the computer system"" to find and compile the 2011 crime statistics submitted to The Bee  not the data it reported to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.The FBI uses police departments' annual reports to compile national crime statistics. Even with the corrected data, West Sacramento Mayor Christopher Cabaldon is clear-eyed about crime's impact on the city.He said criminals didn't target specific neighborhoods. ""There were other offenses citywide, they're definitely not occurring in one particular neighborhood,"" Cabaldon said. ""(Crime) is a challenge across all parts of the city as it is across the country. It's a growing, significant problem.""Criminologists who talked to The Bee this week said reduced police staffing and the economy could be contributing factors in other cities in the region.Police staffing has remained stable in West Sacramento, Sockman said, but the economy continues to take its toll.West Sacramento has, by far, Yolo County's highest jobless rate at 17.9 percent, according to the state's Employment Development Department. Yolo County unemployment stands at 11.7 percent.""People have been forced from their jobs. They're losing their homes. It could be a direct reflection of what's happening in the region and the state,"" Sockman said.But the police spokesman said it was hard to pinpoint the factors behind the crime numbers in his city.Burglaries, for instance, declined each year during the recession before sharply rising again in 2012.Still, data showed larcenies and vehicle thefts were down slightly in 2012 from 2011.But police are vexed by break-ins. Consider that 386 burglaries were reported in West Sacramento in 2012  a 51 percent increase over the amended 2011's 256 incidents.""The biggest issue is burglary,"" he said. ""We already see we need to work on burglaries.""Sockman said the department has assigned a detective to burglary cases and residents are being advised to alter the times they leave for work. Many break-ins happen in the morning hours as residents head to their jobs, Sockman said.Still, Sockman, a 15-year police veteran, said, ""This city is a safer place than when I came here years ago.""He pointed to a 19 percent drop in major crimes in the past 10 years, even as the city has grown by more than 40 percent to more than 49,000 people.""Public safety is our primary mission. It's why we exist,"" said Cabaldon, saying West Sacramento remains in a ""dramatic long-term decline in crime.""""It's an issue for those who live here, work here and have businesses today. It's really about basic quality of life for people in the city now. It will be clear that we're holding our own."""\u000a

This is a sports marketing opportunity,"" Gossage said. ""Demographically, it's a perfect match.""The NRA sponsored a NASCAR Nationwide Series race in Atlanta last September, the ""NRA American Warrior 300.""Gossage said this a one-year title sponsorship agreement with the NRA. He said that the track normally signs three-year deals with title sponsors, but that the NRA has options for the following seasons. He said the NRA approached the track last fall about a deal, but that it was not finalized until last week.The announcement was made during Media Day at Texas Motor Speedway, where drivers Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Travis Pastrana and James Buescher met with reporters to promote the race weekend.In a video message, NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre said, ""The NRA 500 is the latest announcement in the long history of a growing partnership between the NRA, Speedway Motorsports and the NASCAR community.""Gossage expressed no concern about any potential negative effects from associating itself with a controversial organization.Texas Motor Speedway said the NRA has contributed more than $500,000 to the track's Texas Chapter of Speedway Children's Charities. Speedway Motorsports, Inc. is the owner of TMS.""I think it's great. I mean, the NRA is our core fan base,"" Stenhouse Jr. said.

V"When I saw the off-Broadway production of Rajiv Joseph's ""Gruesome Playground Injuries"" in 2011, the production was being overshadowed by another Joseph play. The prolific and highly regarded young writer was then a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his ""A Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo"" starring Robin Williams. Readying for its Broadway premiere, that production was naturally pulling the media spotlight. ""Gruesome Playground Injuries,"" though, was a sadly beautiful play and a nearly perfect love story. And there are injuries of the gruesome playground variety and several others both physical and emotional. It's a strong, complex, occasionally slippery play to get a read on. Resurrection Theatre, which is in its third incarnation in about as many years, presents ""Injuries"" as its first show of the 2013 season, with co-founder Margaret Morneau directing this Sacramento premiere. The two-person show, which moves back and forth through the lives of longtime friends Kayleen and Doug, stars Laura Kaya and Joshua Glenn Robertson. 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays through Feb. 9 at the Wilkerson Theatre, 1723 25th St., Sacramento, in the California Stage complex at 25th and R streets.

V"The Greatest Show on Turf is bracing for the Big Green Machine.That's the promotional twist for tonight's game between Folsom, led by record-setting quarterback Jake Browning, and De La Salle, the national power dressed in green that methodically grinds teams with machine-like efficiency, in one of the most significant high school sporting events in Sacramento-area history.A full house of more than 20,000 at Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium is expected for the first Northern California Regional Open showdown.Beyond deciding who advances to the CIF State Open Bowl next weekend in Carson, tonight's game trumps other high school events simply because De La Salle is involved, making it bigger even than Grant topping nationally ranked No. 2 Long Beach Poly for the first State Open championship in 2008 or Folsom avenging its only loss against Grant before an overflow crowd at Sac State for the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II championship in 2010 en route to a State Bowl win.Folsom (14-0) is ranked third in the state by Cal-Hi Sports and second in Northern California by MaxPreps. De La Salle (13-0) is No. 1 in the state, has finished as the state's top-ranked team by Cal-Hi 16 times since the late 1980s and won the last three State Open titles. The Spartans have not lost to a Northern California opponent since 1991, a span of 237 games.So imagine the rewards if Folsom wins.""I'm not sure if it's just Folsom that wants to beat us or all of Sacramento,"" De La Salle athletic director Leo Lopoz said this week. ""Someone will beat us some day. It's inevitable. We're not naive.""The Bulldogs relish the opportunity to be that team. Browning has passed for 61 touchdowns and nearly 5,000 yards, and De La Salle has a fast, spirited defense waiting for him.Folsom co-coach Kris Richardson said he never hesitated in his desire to face De La Salle.""From the moment I woke up on Sunday, I've heard it  'It's too bad you've got to play De La Salle,' "" Richardson said. ""We're 14-0. We're section champs. We're playing De La Salle in the Open game, which tells us that we're one of the two best teams in Northern California. How is that bad? It's a great opportunity, and we're excited.""Sacramento-area teams have been eager for a chance to play De La Salle for decades.The Spartans are 4-0 against Sacramento-area teams (39-7 over El Camino in 1987, 24-7 over Valley in 1988, 48-14 over Nevada Union in 1997 and 48-13 over Nevada Union in 1998) and 31-0 against Sac-Joaquin Section teams since Bob Ladouceur became coach in 1979. And Ladouceur is 317-5-2 against Northern California teams since 1984.""It's always funny to me when Sacramento people seem to complain that their teams always are in the shadow of De La Salle,"" Mark Tennis, editor of Cal-Hi Sports, said. ""It's funny because De La Salle casts a shadow over the entire state. It's not a Sacto vs. Bay Area lack-of-respect deal. De La Salle football has just been that good for so long against everybody.""De La Salle defensive coordinator Terry Eidson said his team is excited to compete in Sacramento for the first time. ""It's unfortunate a great team won't be going to the state bowls,"" Eidson said, ""but in terms of fan excitement and the gala of high school football, you can't beat it."""\u000a

V"Ninth-ranked Christian Brothers is among the favorites this season to play for a Sac-Joaquin Section Division III girls basketball title and, possibly, make a deep run in the CIF Northern California playoffs.But nothing the Falcons face in the weeks ahead will match the claustrophobic atmosphere of last Friday's nonleague meeting at parochial-school rival St. Francis.""We call it the flashcard game,"" says CBS coach Ron Gully. ""You cram 1,200 into the gym, with 1,000 of them students who are loud and crazy, and nothing comes close to matching this game, not Arco or Cosumnes River College, where we've played in the section playoffs.""It's the only time I use five colored flashcards to let the players know what defense to play. Otherwise, they can't hear me because it's so loud.""The noise didn't bother the Falcons. They walloped the then-No. 5 Troubadours 89-50.Freshman Dominque McNeely scored 18 points, sophomore Kira McKechnie 16, senior Niel Valmores 15 and junior Alicia Gonzalez 14.Christian Brothers' record is a misleading 9-6.The Falcons have lost to current No. 2 Oak Ridge, No. 3 Kennedy and No. 6 Nevada Union. They also have lost to NorCalPreps.com's Northern California No. 2 St. Mary's of Stockton, No. 8 Miramonte of Orinda and No. 17 Sacred Heart Cathedral of San Francisco.Five of those losses were played without Valmores, the Falcons' heart-and-soul point guard who missed seven games with a severe concussion.""She makes everyone on our team better,"" Gully said.That includes fellow backcourt mate and four-year starter Ana Burch, the returning Capital Valley Conference MVP, who led the team in scoring (16.1 points) and rebounding (8.2) last season.""They've played together since the sixth grade, so those two girls read each other's minds,"" Gully said. ""They play so well together.""Gully has a nice mix of experience and youth  five freshmen contribute  and may have his best team since his first season in 2007-08, when the Brittany Woodard-led Falcons went 27-5 and won the D-IV section title.Woodward went on to play at Nevada and Cal Poly.Winning league or section championships  or winning 123 games in six seasons  is not as important to Gully as the ""privilege"" of mentoring student-athletes.It's all pretty heady stuff for a retired police K-9 handler who got involved in coaching when his sixth-grade daughter, Alexis, came home from school one day and said there might not be a girls basketball team because they didn't have a coach.""I had never coached basketball before,"" Gully said. ""But it's been 11 years now (eight total at CBS), and it's still a real fun job.""Cougars keep pace  With senior Lynette Johnson making key plays late and scoring a game-high 20 points, No. 3 Kennedy held off No. 7 McClatchy 51-43 in a Metro Conference game Monday night in Greenhaven.McClatchy, which trailed Kennedy 41-24 entering the final quarter, suffered its first loss of the season following 13 wins.The win keeps Kennedy in a tie for first place in the Metro with top-ranked Sacramento.

""This was by far our best game. We're a family. Our chemistry has definitely evolved.""It's a staple for Dave Parsh-coached teams to share the ball, to hustle on defense and to make long-range shots, and all of that played out for Kennedy, which now takes on national power St. Mary's of Stockton on Saturday for the title at Sleep Train Arena. The Rams ripped Armijo 94-61 in the other semifinal and now seek their 13th championship at various levels since 1999.Emerging post Dalayna Tyler-Scott had 16 inside points for the Cougars. Jessica Lauderdale scored eight points and had six assists for Kennedy (24-5).Jenn Hoffman led Oak Ridge (25-4) with 10 points. The Trojans shot 34 percent and were outrebounded 33-19.With Johnson leading the charge, Parsh likes his chances against St. Mary's.""She's a dynamite player,"" Parsh said. ""She's very poised and skilled.""Johnson said confidence will be the key against the Rams.""We have to give them a challenge,"" she said. ""A lot of teams go in intimidated against them. Can't do that.""  Division IISacramento 52, Del Oro 31  Chaya Durr doesn't mind the extra motivation.The Dragons' junior guard got an earful at the half from fiery coach Michele Massari for her pedestrian first two quarters (four points and two rebounds) with top-seeded Sacramento leading 23-15.""I always start off slow for some reason,"" Durr said with a big smile. ""Coach Michele was in the locker room yelling at me, 'We need you.' I hate to say that, but that helps me.""Did it ever.Durr had eight points and three steals in little more than a two-minute span early in the third quarter, helping the Dragons (26-4) pull away from the No. 5 Golden Eagles (19-11).The win advances the Dragons to their ninth consecutive section final  the first at D-II  after winning the last two D-III championships. The Dragons will play Florin, which defeated McNair 44-41 in Thursday's late semifinal, Saturday at 1 p.m. at Sleep Train Arena.The speedy, 5-foot-10 Durr, a role player last season who has worked her way into a leadership role this season for the Dragons, finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and nine steals.Senior Allie Green added 15 points and seven rebounds; 6-4 junior post Ayanna ""Shaq"" Edwards had seven points and 16 rebounds, and the Dragons collectively played strong defense in forcing Del Oro into 26 turnovers and 23 percent shooting (11 for 47) from the floor.""When Chaya plays like that, nobody can stop her,"" Massari said. ""Shaq was a beast, and Allie Green played with a fire in her eyes. Everyone played with a lot of fire.""Sophomore forward Lauren Heyn led Del Oro with seven points and 11 rebounds, but the Dragons limited Golden Eagles stars Brianna Ruiz and Stephanie Geyer to a combined nine points.""Their athleticism turned the game and forced our hand a little bit,"" said Del Oro coach Mike Takayama. ""In the first half, we did a good job of limiting the turnovers. But in the second half they had a spurt of steals that really hurt us. They took us out of our comfort zone."""\u000a

V"There's been a lot of talk lately about stage musicals being better than their film adaptations.It's true. The stage musical ""Rock of Ages,"" playing through Sunday at Sacramento's Community Center Theater, surpasses the 2012 movie version starring Tom Cruise. (The verdict on ""Les Misrables"" will wait until the stage show arrives in May in Sacramento.)The touring version of ""Rock of Ages"" lacks Cruise's magnetic, sinuous star turn as rocker Stacee Jaxx. The show's Stacee is lent an androgynous charisma by actor Universo Pereira, but the character is too sketchily drawn to make a significant impact.However, Cruise was just about all the movie version had going for it. ""Rock of Ages"" on stage, by contrast, features lively dance numbers, setting-appropriate bawdiness (toned down in the movie) and the visceral thrill of screaming guitar solos played by a live band on stage for the show's duration.A jukebox musical based on the songs of such legendary Broadway composing teams as Poison and Whitesnake, ""Rock of Ages"" celebrates the whiskey-soaked debauchery of rock clubs on Los Angeles' Sunset Strip in the 1980s.The actors from the national touring company of ""Rock of Ages,"" which has been on Broadway since 2009, hit most of their musical notes Tuesday, the show's opening night in Sacramento. That's a feat. Rockers in the 1980s could scream on key. We're talking Steve Perry and Pat Benatar pipes.We are not, unfortunately, sadly, talking about the pipes of Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, an '80s band you can still feel good about loving in 2013. The band behind the song ""Rock of Ages"" did not allow its music to be used in the show.But perennials Journey, Foreigner, Joan Jett, Bon Jovi and Benatar did allow use of their music, as did pan-flashers Mr. Big, Extreme, Asia and Europe. So if continent bands are your jam, rock on. The big ""Rock of Ages"" bus has room for everybody, as long as you are OK with sexual innuendo, scatological jokes and decibel levels that occasionally reach rock-concert heights.The sound bothers only occasionally. Mostly, it excites to be in the classy Community Center Theatre and consider reaching for ear plugs, as if you are at Ace of Spades.Nearly as exciting is Justin Colombo, a raunchy delight as Lonny, sound man at the Strip's dingy, storied Bourbon Room, the setting of ""Rock of Ages."" Lonny is also the show's fourth-wall-breaking narrator.You get the feeling Lonny, with his mullet and too-tight T-shirts emblazoned with off-color slogans, was written as buffoonish. But Colombo is too vibrant for that. The mullet looks great on him, and he shows agility in dance numbers despite a gut exaggerated by painted-on jeans.He's the bird-flipping, tongue-thrusting embodiment of the rock spirit, the one that is kind of dirty and has had too many Miller High Lifes. Your eyes land on Colombo even when he is in shadow and other actors are in the spotlight.Lonny is the vehicle for the appealing self-awareness displayed by ""Rock of Ages."" Early in the first act, he exits the make-believe of the show's scruffy rock-club set to address the audience, informing us that ""Rock of Ages"" will contain a love story, because musicals require one.The subsequent tale of aspiring rocker Drew (Danny McHugh) and starry-eyed fledgling actress Sherrie (Shannon Mullen) is as perfunctory as Lonny's introduction indicates.Mullen shows vocal range, though her phrasing can be too Broadway-baby for rock songs. But she ingratiates herself fully as the show progresses and Sherrie is taken far out of her comfort zone.Drew doesn't get much of a character arc, but McHugh can hold high notes so long you want to whip out a Bic. (Cellphone lights are for Michael Bolton fans).Mullen's and McHugh's duet on Damn Yankees' inherently theatrical ballad ""High Enough"" plays to both their vocal strengths.To say more about the story would give it too much credence. It exists to string together songs. ""Rock of Ages"" falters at times by forgetting that, and offering too much talk and not enough rawk.But just when things start to drag, the show will introduce an eye- or ear-catching moment. Some come from actor Stephen Michael Kane, who sparkles as Franz, a young German who becomes part of the scene at the Bourbon.Sometimes, the memorable moments simply entail young women dancing in fishnet stockings. Hey, it works. Actually, all the dancing in ""Rock of Ages"" works, because the choreography maintains a rock 'n' roll spontaneity. Actors dance in unison, but their limbs sometimes go slightly akimbo. That lack of uniformity keeps things dynamic.""Rock of Ages"" also ventures out musically by mashing up its '80s songs. This is effective in most instances, because some songs are too cheesy to be performed in their entirety. But a ""Shadows of the Night""/""Harden My Heart"" mashup goes too far. Merging Benatar with Quarterflash (fake Benatar) is a rock 'n' roll travesty.ROCK OF AGES  What: A jukebox rock musical, presented by Broadway SacramentoWhen: 8 tonight, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, 2 p.m. SundayWhere: Community Center Theater, 1301 L St., SacramentoCost: $19-$86Time: 2 hours, 30 minutes, including an intermissionInformation: (916) 557-1999, www.tickets.com"\u000a

V"Two cowboys stand next to each other, their arms crossed, their legs spread, and their brightly colored neon chaps overlapping, the right leg of one merging with the left leg of the other.They were familiar sights, these neon cowboys, to anyone who visited the Mapes Hotel-Casino in downtown Reno before its 2000 implosion.After it opened in 1946, the Mapes was for a long time the biggest, most modern hotel in the city. It featured top entertainers in its Sky Room and became the select place to stay for celebrities, including Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe when they filmed ""The Misfits.""The shine didn't last. When the Mapes closed in 1982, it was so out of date, the elevators still were human-operated. Still, there's plenty of nostalgia for the old place, as well as for other Reno landmarks that became regular stops for tourists. Those memories are the main attraction of ""The Light Circus: Art of Nevada Neon"" at the Nevada Museum of Art through Feb. 10.Reno collector Will Durham has worked for the past decade to build the collection. He and the museum joined forces to restore, rewire and relight the pieces that truly represent Reno's and the rest of Nevada's appeal through the mid-part of the 20th century.Neon was essential. Most of the best-known images are gone now, but the exhibition includes yet another cowboy, this one in the shape of the state itself, cowboy hat worn tilted on the side, hand raised in greeting, and chaps ablaze; he stood over the entrance to the Nevada Club, now incorporated into Harrah's Reno. There are images from Harolds Club, also now incorporated into Harrah's, and signs from other businesses, most notably Parker's Western Wear, a destination in and of itself. (160 W.

V"WASHINGTON  The Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday approved a bill to help the families of the 11 victims of last year's Deepwater Horizon blowout by changing outdated federal maritime laws, one going back to the 1850s, to make it possible to recover damages from BP, rig operator Transocean and rig subcontractors. The Deepwater Horizon Survivors' Fairness Act would amend the Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act to allow the victims' families to claim non-compensatory damages, such as pain and suffering and loss of companionship. Both laws prohibit such claims. The bill also would change the Shipowners' Liability Act of 1851, which limits a vessel owner's liability to the value of the vessel and its freight. The Death on the High Seas Act, which dates to the 1920s, effectively prevents the victims' families from suing BP, Transocean and the other companies involved by limiting compensation to funeral expenses and lost wages. The bill also allows the injured workers and families of victims to bring suit without a final judgment in the Transocean limitation of liability action, which the company filed in May 2010 and would limit its liability to just under $27 million. The bill only affects the specific victims of the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Similar legislation passed the House last year but didn't move through the Senate.

V"Two opposing forces are at it again in Sacramento, wrangling over where the region's next generation will live and how its members will get where they need to go.It's the traditional open-space builders vs. the new urbanists.Last month, the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors approved 2,700-acre Cordova Hills, a suburban development in the hills south of Grant Line Road, just beyond the Rancho Cordova city limits.That project would offer some spacious home sites with panoramic views at the base of the foothills.Transportation planners, air quality experts and environmentalists don't like it. They say there's plenty of developable land closer to the heart of the metro area, including for big houses.But the supervisors - several of whom are suburbanites and rural residents - are generally disinclined to stand in the way of businesspeople who want to make money offering potential buyers the suburban lifestyle for which Sacramento has been known for decades. They also have fingers crossed a university might someday be built there.The other approach - more activist - was on display Thursday in a forum attended by Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Sacramento, and urban leaders at the Crocker Art Museum.It was hosted by the Urban Land Institute's local chapter, which has become a power player in advising urban Sacramento leaders on how to respond to an expected increase in people who don't want a big lawn to mow or a long commute to negotiate.A ULI panel recently gave Sacramento some eye-opening ideas on developing the downtown railyard. One idea: Knock down some freeway ramps to connect the downtown site to the Sacramento River.Last week, the ULI provided the Greater Broadway Partnership with ideas on making that already successful strip more of an urban economic powerhouse.Thursday's ULI forum at the Crocker was focused on how West Sacramento and downtown Sacramento leaders can intelligently prepare for an estimated 50,000 more people expected to live near both banks of the Sacramento River in the next 30 years.One speaker, West Sacramento City Manager Marty Tuttle, made a point of dismissing the Cordova Hills approval as ""more of a 1975 decision.""His city, which already built its own close-in suburban area, Southport, now plans hundreds of riverfront apartments and condos, with bike trails connecting to Davis and to downtown Sacramento over two or three new bridges, and a streetcar system across the river.Sacramento has similar waterfront projects in mind.The new urbanists have momentum. Ultimately, the next generation of buyers will vote with their pocketbooks what gets built. It looks like they'll have an option: Stay suburban. Or go urban."\u000a

V"How does $7 sound for a gallon of milk?It isn't out of the question.Call it the ""dairy cliff""  the quiet, rural cousin of the fiscal drama that's gripping Washington. Unless Congress acts by New Year's Day, a federal farm policy from the Truman era would kick in, sending dairy prices into the stratosphere.The impact wouldn't be felt immediately, and Congress could remedy things before prices get out of hand. But the price of milk possibly could double to $7 or more a gallon in a few months.That would be disastrous for consumers  and could bring utter chaos to California's $7.7 billion-a-year dairy industry, the largest in the nation.While dairy farmers are struggling and would welcome more money for their milk, they aren't embracing a huge spike in prices. They believe it would bring in a flood of cheap imported milk, possibly crowding California producers out of the market, said Michael Marsh of Western United Dairymen, a Modesto trade organization.Then there's the impact on sticker-shocked consumers, who might find ways to sidestep the supermarket dairy counter.""There are people who would quit drinking milk,"" said Case Van Steyn, whose family operates a 1,000-cow dairy farm in the Galt area. ""It's not reasonable. It's not fair to consumers.""The problem stems from machinations in Congress over the farm bill  the law establishing price supports for dairy and other commodities.The farm bill is supposed to be renewed every five years. The last one expired Sept. 30. As a result, unless Congress intervenes, the dairy price support mechanism will revert as of New Year's Day to a 1949 dairy law.The 1949 law sets out a formula for price supports that dates to World War I. Under that formula, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would pay $38 for every hundredweight, or 100 pounds, of surplus dairy products, said Leslie ""Bees"" Butler, an agricultural economist at the University of California, Davis. Commodity prices are often expressed in hundredweight increments.That's far above the current federal support price of $10, and more than double the $18 farmers are currently getting on the open market, Butler said.As more and more product gets sold to the government, Butler said retail prices for milk, currently around $3.60 a gallon, could easily double.""The dairy industry is really concerned that consumers would go elsewhere, start buying soy milk and other substitutes,"" he said.Higher prices, however, wouldn't hit consumers right away. The government doesn't have to start buying surplus products until there's actually a surplus. Winter is the low point for milk production, and a surplus wouldn't occur until spring or early summer, Butler said.""Government is not obliged, at least immediately, to start purchasing,"" he said. ""It would take several months  for that to work its way through the system.""Also, dairy producers would be reluctant to ""short their commercial customers"" in order to sell to the government, said Bill Schiek, economist with the Dairy Institute of California.The impasse in Washington has been brewing for months. The Senate passed a farm bill over the summer and the House Agriculture Committee passed a different version. But it hasn't come to a vote of the full House.On Friday, congressional leaders began talking about a temporary fix  a one-year extension of the bill that would prevent milk prices from skyrocketing.""We certainly want to make sure we have a responsible short-term extension if it is not possible to get the farm bill done,"" Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, told the online news service The Hill.Dairy farmers are struggling. Their profits have been squeezed by runaway prices for feed. About 50 of the 1,600 California farms that belong to Western United Dairymen went out of business this year, Marsh said.So why not embrace a doubling of milk prices? Marsh said the U.S. milk supply would simply explode as domestic and foreign farmers rushed to expand production.""You'd see milk, dairy products, flood in from Canada, Mexico,"" he said.Then, at some point, Congress would slash price supports, and the country would be awash in cheap milk.""They'd crash the price to oblivion,"" Van Steyn said.The Galt farmer, whose family has been in the dairy business since 1956, said producers need prices to go up from the current $18 per hundred pounds.Something on the order of $22 or so would be nice, he said, ""if we want dairy farmers to stop going bankrupt."""\u000a

V"Eddie Vanderdoes can explain all of it.The quirky nature. The sideline shimmy shake. The good cheer when his body aches.He's a lineman.Vanderdoes heads a large and in charge brigade of regional high school blockers, run stoppers and sack artists whose big games are matched by their big personalities.A 6-foot-4, 303-pound senior defensive tackle for Placer, Vanderdoes said linemen require a certain mentality to man the trenches that include collisions on every snap. He's done his part for the Hillmen's 11-0 team that seeks a Sac-Joaquin Section Division IV championship.""You have to be kind of crazy to play line, kind of mad,"" Vanderdoes said. ""All the hitting, it doesn't feel good the next day. Head hurts, hand hurts, ankles. So it's OK to be a dork.""Josh Wormley, a 6-1, 260-pound senior offensive lineman at Folsom takes it personally if his quarterback even gets touched by a defensive lineman, or if someone claims to be a better dancer. His quarterback, Jake Browning, has tossed 50 touchdown passes for the 11-0 Bulldogs, who are seeking their second D-II section title in three years.Wormley is the self-proclaimed king of freestyle rap on campus. He gyrates and grooves for his teammates before and after games. During competition, his co-coach Kris Richardson said: ""Josh has a big-time nasty streak. But as soon as it's over, he's all smiles.""Wormley sports a big belly, but he doesn't try to conceal it. He leaves it exposed for all to see at practice. No wonder teammates call him ""The Big Lovely.""""I like to have a little fun, and my friends do think I'm a little crazy,"" Wormley said. ""All linemen are.""William Vi mans the defensive line for Franklin in Elk Grove, which is 11-0 and seeks a D-I championship. The 5-10, 210-pound Vi uses quickness to zip around bigger linemen, and he uses quick wit to keep his teammates and coaches in stitches.""Nicest kid I've ever known,"" Wildcats coach Mike Johnson said. ""He once told me, 'Happy Labor Day, Coach!' He'll text me to have a good weekend. Then he'll flip that switch to what I call 'Go Juice,' and he'll tear your helmet off.""How does a coach explain the behavior of linemen?""I think their personality gives them spark,"" Johnson said. Folsom co-coach Troy Taylor agreed. The Cordova graduate set passing marks at Cal and played a bit in the NFL, so he understands the value  and quirks  of a lineman.""They're usually the sharpest guys on the team,"" Taylor said. ""They have to make a ton of calls and decisions on the line, and they get after it. They're gladiators, and they never complain. Skill guys are playing throw and catch and the linemen are hitting the sled.""And they play in pain.""Wormley came over during a game with his fingernail torn off,"" Taylor said. ""Nasty injury. He didn't want to come out because he wanted to protect his quarterback. Linemen play. If it was me, I'd be off to the hospital.""At D-IV Capital Christian, the biggest man on campus also has the biggest laugh.Two-way junior lineman Nifae Lealao, all 6-4 and 270 pounds, loves contact, his team's 10-1 record and fashion. Yes, fashion.""He carries a book to tell you which colors match and which clash,"" said Jason Harper, a motivational speaker involved with Character Combine, a program that works with area coaches and athletes. ""He could be a Hollywood stylist A-lister. He took a (recruiting) trip to the Oregon Ducks but couldn't stand the green. He's a behemoth of a man with an even bigger heart, and you'd think he sings in deep bass. Instead, he's in the school choir as a tenor.""The other 11-0 team in the D-I field is Burbank, a program anchored on defense by junior tackle Ngalu Tapa. He's a 6-3, 270-pound force of nature, known to pull his helmet off on the sideline and yell into the air, his shock of hair spilling out like straw. Tapa leads the state with 22 sacks, and he leads his team in charm, his friends say.""I've been told I'm a little different,"" Tapa said with a grin.At Elk Grove, the 10-1 Thundering Herd is on a quest for the D-II title with the help of a defensive end with slight shoulders  Bwon Canada. He's a 6-1, 178-pound junior whose ""constant motor"" allows him to impact games, coach Chris Nixon said. Canada's nickname is ""Squidward"" for resembling the SpongeBob character, and his boundless energy keeps his teammates guessing at what's coming next.Canada missed two games late this season as he awaited medical clearance. He paced the sideline like a caged tiger.""I don't think the doctor understood his personality,"" Nixon said. ""It's nice to know a SpongeBob character sparks us.""So when does a lineman evolve into his personality? Early for Canada.Elk Grove quarterback Tommy Arnold recalled his youth football days suiting up alongside Canada, and the sounds and smells coming from his teammate.""He's the only guy I've seen growling and salivating on the line of scrimmage,"" Arnold said. ""That was when we were 10 years old. He still does it.""Said Canada: ""I can't help it. It's who I am.""In Auburn, Vanderdoes is a celebrity. A local hamburger joint invited the most heavily recruited athlete in Placer High history to create his own signature burger. So he did: Four quarter-pound patties, four slices of cheese and handfuls of veggies for ""The Big Eddie.""""I ate it two different times, and when I finished, I was done for the whole day,"" Vanderdoes said. ""You need a nap (after) one of those because it'll change your day."""\u000a

V"Digol J'Beily dreamed of teaching and coaching at his alma mater, giving back to a school that gave him so much.A star student-athlete in the late 1980s at Center High School, J'Beily landed a U.S. history teaching job at the school in 1995 and became football coach in 2003. But the dream morphed into a nightmarish spring in 2005.J'Beily was forced out of his coaching position through a vote by two school board members who were vague in their reasoning, including one who allegedly took it personally that J'Beily didn't start his son at quarterback three years earlier.The controversy ignited a firestorm in Antelope. Teachers threatened to resign, and players and community members rallied in support of the coach.J'Beily was quickly reinstated, but it took time to build the football program. The Cougars were 1-9 in 2010 and a playoff team last season that lost to Oakdale in the first round. Leading by example, J'Beily implored his athletes to hang in there and stick with it. The Cougars' breakthrough team has arrived.No. 10-seed Center (10-2) takes on sixth-seeded Central Catholic of Modesto tonight in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division IV semifinal. Central Catholic (10-2) has won a section-record 15 small-school titles.Center has used speed and tenacity to get this far. Tailback D'Juan Bellaire has rushed for an area-leading and school-record 2,081 yards and 27 touchdowns. Quarterback Tyrel Anderson has passed for 1,381 yards and 14 touchdowns, and two-way linemen Preston Dobbins, Jason Perry and Spencer Bracey have helped lead the running game and combined for 34.5 sacks.""It's been such a great year with so many kids working so hard,"" J'Beily said.

He played with Fats Domino and Paul Anka, ""back when Anka was the only one who had a hit. He could charge $2.50 a show.""From then on, the history of the group gets extended and complicated.At one time, several groups calling themselves the Drifters played around the country, ""like the Platters and the Coasters.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2011/02/10/3393646/environmentalists-to-sue-over.html,"WASHINGTON  The Interior Department has approved 10 oil and gas exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico since October in violation of two laws that protect whales and other marine mammals, environmental groups said Thursday. The projects were approved without the permits required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Gulf Restoration Network, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club said in a formal notice of their intent to sue the government. Even after the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, the feds are still violating the laws intended to protect the Gulf's wildlife in their rush to approve offshore oil activities, Miyoko Sakashita, the oceans director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a news release. Kendra Barkoff, an Interior Department spokeswoman, said officials wouldn't comment. The environmental groups said the seismic testing that oil companies use to search for oil can cause hearing loss in marine mammals, drive them away from feeding grounds and disturb their breeding.  The Gulf of Mexico is home to endangered sperm whales. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says sperm whales are the only endangered whales commonly found there. The environmental groups said in their letter that five other whale species listed under the law as endangered also inhabit the Gulf. It is intolerable to think that the same species threatened by the Gulf spill will have to contend with the industry's constant pounding, without any serious attempt to mitigate the harm, said Michael Jasny, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The groups' letter also charges that the government violated the Endangered Species Act by failing to account adequately for the impact of an oil spill and of the noise from oil exploration and production when it created a five-year oil- and gas-leasing program for 2007-2012 in the central and western Gulf of Mexico. The groups said their suit would be filed against the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Commerce.

V"No Sac-Joaquin Section girls sprinter has won a CIF State Track and Field championships.That could change Saturday if Rosemont junior Nia Dorner is on her game at the 94th annual event that starts with trials today at Buchanan High School in Clovis.Dorner ranks second in California in the 400 meters with a time of 54.94 seconds. She ran the 31st-best time nationally this season at the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II-III championships May 18 at Bella Vista.Only Renetia James of Serra of Gardena has run faster in California. James set her season best of 54.41 in Friday's Southern Section Masters final.Dorner ran a 55.07 the same night in the Sac-Joaquin Section Masters final.She defeated runner-up Joy Weems of Del Campo by more than two seconds (57.18) in unseasonably cold and windy conditions at Elk Grove High School.While most would gladly accept such a time considering the conditions  only three other girls in California have run faster this season  Dorner had a different perspective.""No, I'm not happy,"" Dorner said seconds after receiving her first-place medal. ""I felt like I could have done better.""Those who know her say that's typical Nia Dorner.Known for her work ethic, Dorner is her own toughest critic and no doubt frustrated that she has yet to surpass her personal best of 54.83 set early in her sophomore season.""She wanted to finish in the mid 54s,"" said Rosemont coach Scott Maddox. ""Nia works so hard and puts so much time into practice. And as talented and special as she is on the track, she's an even better individual and quality student on campus.""Maddox calls Dorner a ""practice stopper."" When she runs, her teammates halt what they're doing to watch.He credits sprint coach David Lawrence for Dorner's consistency. She has won 11 of 12 races in the 400 this season.""She is a student of track and field,"" Maddox said. ""Coach Lawrence has done a marvelous job preparing her.""The only girls to beat Dorner in head-to-head competition were junior Ellisa Bryant of San Jose's Piedmont Hills and James in the Mount Sac Relays on April 1. Both also are entered in today's 26-person trials field, with the top nine qualifying for Saturday's finals.Dorner finished fifth (55.54) in last year's state meet. She had the 16th-best time (56.58) in the state meet trials as a freshman.""In past years, there were individuals she would have had to do something incredible to beat,"" Maddox said. ""But she's coming in with the No. 2 time and isn't that far from the leader. It's exciting to have a horse in the race.""A surprising leap  At the start of the season, Rio Americano's Basil Okoroike had no idea that he would be competing in today's state triple jump trials.Okoroike, a football and basketball standout for the Raiders, had only dabbled in track.""Qualifying for state  it was like a fantasy,"" said Okoroike, a senior sprinter and jumper.But Okoroike made a leaps-and-bounds improvement in the triple jump during the season. His best of 47 feet, 5 inches  set May 16 at the D-II-III section finals  is nearly 5 feet better than his first jump of the season.""I just started training harder, put all my focus into this event and kept improving an inch here, a foot there,"" Okoroike said.Now Okoroike is thinking that his ticket to a college scholarship isn't in football, where he was an All-Capital Athletic League performer, but in track.""Free money is free money,"" Okoroike said with a smile after placing second in the triple jump (47-4 1/2) in the Masters finals."\u000a

V"Second-year Dixon football coach Wes Besseghini made a big decision in the offseason. The Rams would switch from the popular spread offense to the throwback wing-T.That move, coupled with another decision to part with well-respected junior varsity coach Troy Hensley, whose team went 9-1 in 2011, made Besseghini a lightning rod for criticism within the community.It didn't help that the varsity team lost its first six games under Besseghini last season before finishing 4-7 and co-champions of the Golden Empire League.""That's what I love about this town,"" said Besseghini, a Dixon graduate who played football for the Rams. ""Everyone cares and wants to see the football team succeed. It was a tough decision and we were under attack for three months, but all we've tried to do from the start is to move forward.""That they have.The Rams are 5-0 as they gear up for their league opener at Capital Christian on Friday, a game that could decide this year's league champion.Besseghini hopes it isn't anywhere near as dramatic as last Friday's game.The Rams trailed Mira Loma 20-0 at home with seven minutes to play before rallying to win 22-20. Sophomore Fredrick Douglas blocked a 34-yard field-goal attempt with 20 seconds to play to preserve the victory.The Rams did it without five injured players, including junior quarterback and team leader Nolan Williams.""I think it's the maturity with the kids,"" Besseghini said. ""Last year we only had seven seniors on the roster. We've got a good group from the 9-1 JV team, and our kids have adapted well to the wing-T, which fits our talent better and can be sustained year after year.""It doesn't hurt that 13 players were members of the Dixon Rugby Club's ground-breaking national high school championship team last spring.Besseghini said senior Josh Watkins, a 6-foot-4, 260-pound tackle and defensive end, could be the program's first Division I lineman recruit since twins Dave Ball, now with the Tennessee Titans, and Mat Ball played at UCLA nearly a decade ago.Besseghini, an Azusa Pacific graduate who played football for one season there (""I decided to give it up after I got my sixth and seventh concussion""), has been on the Dixon football staff since he was 21.Like so many young coaches, he works off campus in construction but hopes to put his teaching credential to use at his alma mater one day.For the past three years he also has worked as Dixon's girls' softball coach with his wife, Jessi, a former college softball player. But he recently resigned because of the birth of his second child, 5-week-old Joshua. (Wes. Jr is 4.)Credit Joshua with nice timing. Dad and mom had planned a Caesarean section a few days after the Rams' Aug. 31 opener against McClatchy. Instead, Joshua arrived Aug. 21.""He decided to come early,"" Wes Sr. said.Coach's first win  First-year Florin coach Mike Rosales earned his first victory Friday, 47-20 over Hiram Johnson in a Metro Conference game, with a little help.Ben Walls threw for 253 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for two scores, Deon Guther had seven catches for 159 yards and two touchdowns, and Louis Shimoum had 13 tackles and a fumble recovery.Florin plays at No. 3 Burbank on Saturday.Falcon tamers?

V"When DeWayne Norris agreed to become the interim football coach at Encina High School in mid-August, his trepidation was understandable.It wasn't about the Bulldogs' sorry history  five wins in seven seasons  their coaching carousel, the nagging shortage of players, the transient student body or the challenging neighborhood demographics.And never mind that two weeks before the team's first game, then-athletic director Richard Tucker, a former college coach who was overseeing the team, resigned and left the school because of a family emergency in Southern California.No, the 62-year-old Norris' greatest concern was that he had never coached football.""It sounds kind of crazy, doesn't it?"" Norris said. ""But I never would have done it if it wasn't for my assistants and the kids. We've got a wonderful group. They didn't need any more letdowns.""Yet, what seemed like a recipe for disaster is turning into an uplifting story at the aging campus of 621 students a few miles from Arden Fair.With the fatherly, low-key Norris at the helm, the Bulldogs are 2-0 after beating West Campus 30-0 in the season opener and Kennedy 30-2 last weekend.Toss in last year's 30-0, season-ending win over San Juan under then-coach Dave Johnson Jr.  snapping a 24-game losing streak  and Encina has an unheard of three-game winning streak entering Saturday's game against Elliot Christian at El Camino High School.But the Eagles from Lodi could be the test of whether this season is a mirage or an oasis for a school that has had just two winning football seasons since 1987.San Juan, West Campus and Kennedy went winless last season while Elliot Christian was a playoff team that won seven games and beat Encina 42-8.Still, Norris is a believer, despite his limited football background. He played high school football in Indiana.""I'm no dummy,"" he said. ""I could see that we had talent  it was just a matter of me not messing it up. 'Tuck' hated to leave, but he laid the foundation by putting in the offense and defense and putting together the coaching staff. I've got great assistants. They know the X's and O's. It's kind of the perfect storm.""A storm that hit West Campus in Week 1.""We couldn't match their speed,"" said West Campus coach Nate Harris. ""That's a very athletic bunch.""A former basketball player at Eastern New Mexico, Norris has worked with at-risk and foster children for years in Sacramento and Davis.The Natomas resident has gotten to know Encina and its students by working as an assistant boys basketball coach for son-in-law Freddie Bryant for the last three seasons.Now Bryant is helping Norris along with assistants Travis Burton, Terry Wilson and Will Clark, the lone holdover from last season, to try to make this a season to remember.""I've always worked with tough kids, and I enjoy it, but these aren't even tough kids,"" Norris said. ""They're just kids trying to make it. We expect discipline and commitment. We push our kids to get an education.  I want to instill a sense of family.""Tasha Bryant, Norris' daughter, is the unofficial team mom, disciplinarian and head cheerleader.""We'd watch the games last year, and the kids would be so deflated,"" she said. ""Dave did a good job, but it's just so hard to keep coaches nowadays. The turnover is tough for the kids because they already are dealing with a lot of stuff kids their age shouldn't have to be dealing with.""Encina's victories in the first two games, matching their highest win total in seven seasons, have led to a dramatic mood change at games.""You can feel the energy,"" Tasha Bryant said. ""The games are exciting; the parents are happy.""Team leaders Maurice Campbell, John Hlyzoff and Daquan Bryant don't want to see the good times end.Still fresh are last season's dark days when there might be a half-dozen players at practice, classmates teased them, the stands were almost empty, and opponents piled on the points (they were outscored 365-30 in their seven losses).""To be honest, I never thought we'd be 2-0 with our old coach leaving so soon,"" said Campbell, a senior running back-safety and the team's emerging star. ""I thought it was going to go downhill.""But coach (Norris) knows football. We're all in way better condition this season. We now have a study hall, so kids can't fall off their grades. It feels like we're building something here.""Daquan Bryant (no relation), a junior linebacker-fullback whom Norris calls the team's emotional leader, sees more resilience and fight this year.""We had 14 to 16 players last year. Now we've got 27, and we're way more athletic,"" Bryant said. ""Last year, when someone would stop us or score, we'd just shut down, argue, get mad. Now there's more trust, and we hustle a lot more.""Hlyzoff, a senior guard-nose tackle with a 4.31 grade-point average, says the coaches are always upbeat, stressing the positive.""It's been us against the world, and people still don't think we're for real,"" said Hlyzoff, who aspires to attend Stanford. ""Hopefully, we can build a program and start a dynasty that will make our school proud."""\u000a

V"WASHINGTON  Government scientists wanted to tell Americans early on how bad the BP oil spill could get, but the White House denied their request to make the worst-case models public, a report by the staff of the national panel investigating the spill said Wednesday.White House officials denied that they tried to suppress the information. The allegation was made by unnamed government officials cited in a staff working paper released Wednesday by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. Although not a final report, it could raise questions over whether the Obama administration tried to minimize the extent of the BP oil spill, the worst man-made environmental disaster in U.S. history.The staff paper said that underestimating the flow rates ""undermined public confidence in the federal government's response"" by creating the impression that the government was either incompetent or untrustworthy. The paper said that the loss of trust ""fuels public fears.""In a separate report, the commission's staff concluded that despite the Coast Guard's insistence that it was always responding to the worst case scenario, the failure to have an accurate flow rate slowed the response and lulled Obama administration officials into a false belief that the spill would be controlled easily. The first report said that the ""decision to withhold worst-case discharge figures"" may have been made at a high level. It said that in late April or early May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ""wanted to make public some of its long-term, worst-case discharge models for the Deepwater Horizon spill, and requested approval to do so from the White House's Office of Management and Budget. Staff was told that the Office of Management and Budget denied NOAA's request."" A joint statement from OMB and NOAA released Wednesday said that OMB had been tapped ""to coordinate and review all interagency materials developed in response to the BP oil spill.""OMB spokesman Kenneth Baer said that the discussions between OMB and NOAA weren't focused on the flow rate, but dealt more broadly with NOAA's modeling for the spill's long-term shoreline impact. Baer said that OMB made no attempt to shield the public from the worst-case flow rate scenario.""The issue was the modeling, the science and the assumptions they were using to come up with their analysis. Not public relations or presentation. We offered them suggestions of ways to improve it and they happily accepted it,"" Baer said.However, the oil flow rate was part of those models.Baer also noted that officials in some instances talked about a possible 100,000-barrel worst-case daily amount.The commission said in a statement that it didn't consider the government's response a contradiction of its report.The government's final estimate, on Aug. 2, was that 62,000 barrels a day leaked in the early period, but that flow declined to 53,000 barrels a day by the time the well was capped on July 15.The report noted that retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's top official on the disaster, and other officials said in news conferences that the government prepared for a worst-case scenario from the beginning, and didn't base decisions about what equipment would be needed on the early estimates of 1,000 to 5,000 barrels a day.However, it said, the government withheld the figures of what ""worst-case"" meant.The second report noted that only after NOAA determined that the flow rate was five times what BP had first estimated, that the Obama administration declared the spill an incident of national significance.""For the first 10 days of the spill, it appears that a sense of over-optimism affected responders,"" the second report said. ""At least one high-level Coast Guard official thought that the oil would not come ashore.""In other contexts, Allen and other officials did elaborate on what that figure roughly meant. Allen told reporters on May 2 that the oil flow could reach 100,000 barrels a day if the well completely failed _ something that never happened. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on the same day told CNN that a worst-case scenario would be 100,000 barrels a day.The government all along had BP's estimates of what a worse-case scenario would be, but never disclosed them to the public, the report said. BP's drilling permit put it at 162,000 barrels a day. On April 23, the Coast Guard and NOAA got an updated estimate of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels a day, but it's unclear whether that information was from BP or how it was derived, the report said. By early May, BP lowered its worst-case estimate to 60,000 barrels a day, the report said. That figure was close to what government scientists later determined was the best estimate for the actual flow. Therefore, the government oil spill response team may have been basing its decision-making on a good estimate, the report noted. However, it added, ""despite the fact that the Unified Command had this information, relied on it for operations, and publicly stated that it was operating under a worst-case scenario, the government never disclosed what its operational scenario was.""

V"It's quite ironic that I was an accident-prone child. I was a climber and a risk-taker who delighted in jumping off beds, rolling down driveways on skateboards (on my belly) and doing dangerous tricks on my bike. I have the scars to prove it.Fast forward 30 years, and I'm a pediatrician and (slightly) overprotective mom who sees danger around every corner. I'm constantly chiding, ""Be careful"" and ""You shouldn't do that  you'll wind up in the ER or worse!""Not only have I done risky things that caused me to get hurt, I've seen (and see) the results of these little risk-takers' risk-taking. Fractures, sutures, concussions and all.Still, I don't want to put kids in a bubble. They need to live, play and learn.And jumping on trampolines? My inner risk-taking child would have delighted in one of those in our backyard. No doubt you would have found me there every chance I got. They're fun, good exercise and can be quite therapeutic.But they can also be very dangerous.The American Academy of Pediatrics recently reaffirmed its stance on those big outdoor recreational trampolines that are in many backyards today. It firmly cautions parents against their use, and for good reason.Most recent studies estimate that 98,000 injuries per year occur as a result of trampoline use, sending 31,000 people to be hospitalized annually, some with severe, life-altering injuries (spinal cord and neurological damage).Netting and other safety gear have not been associated with a decrease risk of injury. In fact, it gives parents a false sense of security.More important, young children are most at risk of being injured on a trampoline. Fractures and severe sprains account for 48 percent of injuries in children under age 5. Recently I saw a preschooler with a fractured forearm  the result of trampoline-jumping gone wrong. She was jumping with multiple other siblings and friends and simply landed hard on her arm.This is typically the scenario with such injuries since we know that 75 percent of injuries occur when two or more people are jumping simultaneously. That risk increases when you have a small child jumping with bigger kids.Add older kids trying to do somersaults and tricks on trampolines, and the risk for severe injury escalates.So for me, I've seen too much to feel comfortable with having one in our own backyard, and I strongly caution parents against them too.Let me be clear: I'm talking about backyard trampolines and not those in gymnastics studios under direct supervision and coaching, or the tiny indoor models used for core-toning. If you plan to have a backyard trampoline or let your child jump on one, these are the safety measures to take: Do not allow children under 6 to jump. Only allow one jumper at a time. Allow no somersaults or tricks. Jumping should always occur under direct supervision of an adult who is willing to enforce and moderate the trampoline rules. Do not be lulled into a false sense of security just because a trampoline has safety nets or other protective equipment.I'm well aware that kids do several things on a daily basis that could potentially land them in an emergency room, waiting to be casted or sutured up. As parents, we do our best to ensure their safety without compromising their willingness and ability to take risks.I think that's important.But equally important is arming ourselves with important safety information in the hopes of balancing childhood risk taking with injury prevention."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/13/4815211/preps-plus-wins-grins-keep-coming.html,"Everything adds up for a big season for St. Francis High School's volleyball team.The Troubadours return 11 of the 12 players from last season's Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship squad, and the roster is stacked with future collegiate players.And much like Tuesday's Holy Court victory over rival Christian Brothers, the stands are filled with fans to watch the area's No. 1-ranked team.That ear-piercing screech that sounds much like a pterodactyl filling the gym? Now that just doesn't add up.But that's just part of the team's chemistry of talent, determination and hijinks that makes it unique and a favorite to not only repeat as section champion but compete for a second state title since 2005.During practices, which can become very heated, junior middle blocker Megan Sullivan is known to belt out a screech that would make Chuck Norris take cover from what surely is a flying prehistoric giant on the loose.But when Sullivan squawks, it's not to intimidate  it's to entice laughter and a little comedic relief from the stress of intense practices.""No one can really do it like her,"" St. Francis coach Alynn Wright said.And few area programs do volleyball quite like St. Francis. The Troubadours are 14-0 this season and didn't drop a set until midway through Wednesday night's match at second-ranked El Camino. St. Francis beat the Eagles 3-1.The ultimate goal, of course, is to improve on last season's effort. St. Francis compiled a 38-6 record in 2011 and won the section championship before being bounced out of the NorCal playoffs in the second round by Menlo-Atherton.The season-ending loss was especially hard on Paige Folger, then the Troubadours' only senior who is now at Gonzaga.""I don't think any of us are ever going to forget the look on Paige's face,"" senior captain Gabby Palmeri said. ""She was not ready for the season to be over. And neither were we. It hit her and all of us.""With 20 players on this season's roster, the team is by far the largest in the area, and practices can break into a matchup of what is arguably two of the best teams in the region.""Some of the best volleyball you see is day in and day out in our gym,"" Wright said. ""At the end of practice, when we are scrimmaging and (losers run sprints) are on the line  it's amazing.""In years past, pitting the backups against the starters didn't make for very much competition. But with a starting lineup that has two standout juniors in Lea Felton and Ali Koumelis, the ""B"" squad is filled with upwards of five returning players from last season. The deep squad  led by seniors Palmeri (committed to Pepperdine), Hannah Liserra (Seattle University) and Dana Vestman (Montana State)  makes for spirited team competition on a daily basis, which intensifies the desire for an undefeated season.""They are deep in talent,"" Bella Vista coach Troy Songer said. ""You could have two starting lineups that would match up with anyone else.""Songer isn't alone in his praise of St. Francis' program.""They are the cream of the crop, by far the best team in the area,"" Whitney coach James Todd said.But while there is plenty of praise heaped upon them from the competition, the internal pressure remains for the Troubadours.""I think we know we are a great team and we know what we expect,"" Palmeri said. ""We understand there are expectations out there, but we have our own standards and what we expect of ourselves.""But before that pressure to succeed boils over, the Troubadours always take time to let off a little steam and remember it's just a game played by fun-loving high school student-athletes.Sullivan stops practice with a screech and runs throughout the gym, her arms flapping like giant wings. Drills are stopped and the girls sit in a circle, legs crossed, and begin playing the most obscure playground game around.Palmeri calls it ""space football."" The game can only be described as, well  it can't be described.But it's that unique ability to suddenly break away from the intensity of practice for a game of laughter and then jump back into the heat of scrimmage that bonds this team.""We are good at turning it on and off,"" Palmeri said. ""There are times when we are joking around, then in an instant we can turn it on and set on the goal.""

V"The wheels buckled a bit here and there, but they never came off.Franklin High School overcame a slow start to this baseball season, dodged pitfalls and potholes during a bumpy regular season amid injuries and stout competition, and capped it Friday night with a slice of school history.The Wildcats beat Delta Valley Conference rival Davis 3-2 to win their first Sac-Joaquin Section Division I North championship at Sacramento City College in Candlestick Park-like chilly conditions.Davis stunned Franklin 5-3 earlier Friday on a Chris Gnos two-run triple in the bottom of the sixth inning to force the deciding game. Gnos had a chance to repeat his effort with two outs and two on in the bottom of the seventh in the clincher, but he went down looking on a Kyle Von Ruden strikeout, eliciting a celebration months in the making.True to form, Franklin's team bus had a blowout on the way home from a 6-2 outbracket win over Vintage of Napa to open this tournament, a complete-game effort for Von Ruden, and sat stranded on the freeway for two hours. On Tuesday, Franklin beat Davis 8-6 in eight innings in a winners' bracket final, and Wildcats first-year coach Bryan Kilby found his pickup with a flat in the parking lot.On Friday, in Game 2, no such detours and no flats later.""It's been an interesting road, but it's been a fun road,"" Kilby said. ""I'm so happy for these kids and these coaches. We played two great games here today. Every game with Davis is like this. We wanted to put the ball in our seniors' hands and let them decide it.""Decide it they did. Brandon Keup allowed five hits and struck out four. The Franklin juniors also had big moments, including Tyler Blake, whose RBI single in the third put Franklin up 2-1. Catcher Nick Frei had an RBI single to make it 3-1. Freshman shortstop Hank LoForte threw out a runner at third base to end the sixth with that 3-2 lead.Von Ruden, the senior leader, came on in relief in the sixth.""What can you say about Von Ruden  a super kid, a great student,"" Kilby said. ""And Hank LoForte plays beyond his years. His baseball IQ is unbelievable. You can tell he's a coach's kid.""Now, LoForte and the gang want what LoForte's father has. Brian LoForte coached McClatchy to the 1998 section D-I title, beating freshly drafted first-round pick C.C. Sabathia and Vallejo.Franklin plays two-time defending D-I champion St. Mary's of Stockton in Game 1 of the best-of-three series on Friday at Pacific.Davis, meanwhile, concludes a trying season that included a DVC championship and a spirited run in this postseason. Blue Devils coach Dan Ariola offered a lot of hugs for departing seniors such as ace Ben Eckels and leader George Hatamiya, the catcher and scholar who played gallantly despite losing his mother, Nancy, to cancer last week. Hatamiya earned the win in relief in the first game Friday and tossed three more solid innings in the nightcap."\u000a

""The public was excluded,"" Cooper said. ""That's poor policy.""Trigg retired as superintendent of the Elk Grove Unified School District in 1995 after a career in education spanning 35 years.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/05/26/4518026/jesuits-mitsch-fights-off-groin.html,"When it comes to putting relays together, injuries kept Jesuit sprint coach Rod Jett on edge all season.He lost key relay sprint standouts Thomas Sperbeck (ankle) and Kaba Alkebulan (broken wrist) during the season, though Sperbeck continued to compete in other events.Then on the eve of Friday's Sac-Joaquin Section Masters track and field championships at Elk Grove High School, Jett thought star junior Austin Mitsch might also be done.Mitsch, the section leader in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, re-strained his groin running a blazing anchor leg in the 4x100 relay at Thursday's trials. He later qualified in the 100 meters but decided to scratch the 200, even though he's ranked No. 11 in California.Uncertain how he'd hold up, Mitsch fought through the pain Friday to anchor the 4x100 relay team to a winning time of 42.18 seconds to qualify for the CIF State Championships on Friday and Saturday in Clovis.Mitsch and fellow relay member Loren Pilorin then teamed to qualify for state in the 100, placing first (11.08) and third (11.32), respectively.""Now I can finally breathe a little,"" Jett said.Mitsch spent Friday icing his groin and wearing an electrical stimulation device to aid blood flow. He also received a chiropractic massage from Peter Grimes, a friend of Jett's, before the start of the meet. ""He worked some magic,"" Mitsch said.Mitsch said he strained his groin at the May 18 D-I section championships, then aggravated it during Thursday's relay. ""It tightened up even more after the 100,"" he said. ""That's when I figured I had to drop the 200, that it was best for my health.""Quipped Pilorin: ""Good decision.""Pilorin, who will run track at Stanford in the fall, knows all about a troublesome groin. He missed nearly two years of track because of injury, returning to competition in mid-April.""So to come back without doing any sprinting whatsoever and do this well is really surprising,"" Pilorin said.In other area highlights: Monterey Trail suffered a huge setback when girls section 100 and 200 leader Esther Higgwe collapsed with a leg injury 40 yards from the finish line of the 200. Higgwe earlier had won the girls 100 (12.32) and anchored the 4x100 girls relay team (47.56) to victories. Higgwe's teammate, A'Jah Love, won the 200 in 25.40. McClatchy's Jordan Monteiro-Williams (22 feet, 10.25 inches) won the long jump and placed second in the boys 200 (22.41). Del Oro's Casey Wheeler won the boys 300 hurdles (38.17), placed third in the boys 110 high hurdles (14.50) and was a member of the winning 4x400 relay team (3:19.71). Rosemont's Nia Dorner, ranked No. 2 in California, repeated as the girls 400 champion (55.07). Antelope's Robert Ellis won the boys 200 meters (22.01). Ponderosa's Brittany Anselmo won the girls 800 (2:14.29) and teammate Sydney Blakely the girls pole vault (11-8). In the distance races, Del Campo's Jordan Rushing won his second consecutive boys 1,600 (4:17.47), Vista del Lago's Madeleine Ankhelyi captured the girls 3,200 (10:40.54), and Monterey Trail's William Reyes won the boys 3,200 (9:19.77)."\u000a

V"Here's a headline you won't see often: ""Music pauses war between bitter enemies.""But for one brief moment during World War I, such a headline applied. In particular, it describes the Christmas truce of 1914. That rare and unexpected cessation of fighting took place amid brutal trench warfare in Ypres, Belgium.German and British troops laid down their arms on a chilly Christmas Eve. Members of the two armies soon began to fraternize, sang songs and took the opportunity to calmly bury their dead.That piece of history forms the backbone of the show ""All Is Calm,"" by the Minneapolis-based male choral ensemble Cantus in collaboration with Theater Latt Da. The show will be performed Saturday at the Mondavi Center in Davis.""Music was the key in the truce,"" said Cantus tenor Aaron Humble, via phone from Minneapolis.Though the history of exactly what was sung first and by whom is lost, it is not unreasonable to think that Franz Gruber's classic, ""Silent Night,"" was sung during the evolution of the truce. "" 'Silent Night' had made its way to other countries by the early 20th century,"" Humble said. ""The English knew the carol, and they identified it as one of their own, and the Germans, they shared knowledge of the same Christmas carols the British knew.""That song, as well as others from that time, which include European carols and war songs, will get fresh arrangements by Cantus. Three Theater Latt Da actors will read excerpts from soldiers' diaries. Quotes from poets who participated in World War I, including Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, will be read during the music.The dramatic and musical arc of the show, which Cantus and Theater Latt Da have performed for the past six years  and which they brought to the Mondavi Center in 2009  begins with the call to war and recruitment. ""There is a real enthusiasm there in the letters from people saying that they thought the war was going to be sort of a picnic,"" Humble said. ""There's a real naivet there, especially letters of younger soldiers.""The music and letters evolve to where they take on a more British perspective, with troops arriving onto the continent and the realization that this war was no game. Then, the letters reflect weariness and an intense desire for the war to end.The idea of mining the truce for the concert stage belongs to Peter Rothstein, artistic director with the Minneapolis-based Theater Latt Da.Rothstein first learned of the truce through John McCutcheon's song ""Christmas in the Trenches,"" but he initially had no serious plans of staging it. ""When the United States invaded Iraq, I decided to move the idea to the front burner and make it happen,"" Rothstein said.What followed was research at the Flanders Field Museum in Ypres. Amid the archives, Rothstein discovered how elemental music was to the truce.""In my opinion, the truce would not have happened if it weren't for music creating a common language between the opposing lines.During the first winter of the war, soldiers on opposing sides began holding impromptu concerts, and in some cases serenaded each other across the no man's land between trenches, Rothstein said. In 2006, Rothstein approached Cantus about coming in on the musical side.""What was appealing to us was the option of doing a Christmas concert that was not your typical sweet-and-saccharine Christmas show,"" said Humble.At first the work was conceived as a radio drama. It received its world premiere as a live broadcast on Minnesota Public Radio in 2007.""We were putting this show together while we were engaged in two wars,"" said Humble. ""What has always been sobering to me is that this scenario is no longer possible now in modern warfare because now there is so little human contact.""""The (World War I) truce was not a singular 'X marks the spot' event. There were truces all up and down the front line that were recorded,"" said Humble. ""Some of them lasted a day and some lasted weeks, and for those that lasted weeks, those troops had to be removed because the soldiers had established a rapport with the enemy, and they were unable to fight.""News of the truce eventually reached higher commands and fighting normalized. The British generals requested lists of soldiers and officers who took part in the truce, for disciplinary action. but no one was disciplined.""The truce was kept secret for a long time. History books did not teach about it.  It was seen as a failure of military discipline,"" Humble said. That, and the fact that the 100th anniversary of the truce is approaching, gives Cantus a certain urgency to keep performing ""All Is Calm."" ""Today, we don't share carols with people we're at war with,"" Humble said. ""Bringing those differences to the light of day? I think that is sobering.""Call The Bee's Edward Ortiz, (916) 321-1071.ALL IS CALMCANTUSWhen: 8 p.m. SaturdayWhere: Jackson Hall, Mondavi Center, UC DavisTickets: $25-$60Information: (530) 754-2787; www.mondaviarts.org"\u000a

V"Isaiah Williams is every bit a bulldog. Short, compact and snarling with a ball in his possession.The Burbank High School senior tailback epitomizes the grit and tenacity of his surging program, 11-0 for the first time with a spirited 26-19 victory over visiting Grant on Saturday afternoon.The Sac-Joaquin Section Division I opener on Florin Road played out in front of an overflow crowd that seemed to exhale or gasp with every game-turning play with a backdrop of dueling drum-line rhythms.It featured longtime rivals of mirror-image programs, and if one player was the difference, it was the one wearing jersey No. 3. The 5-foot-6, 190-pound Williams rushed for 154 yards and had a 25-yard touchdown run for a 19-12 lead in the third quarter. He now has 1,794 rushing yards and 24 touchdowns this season.In Week 2, he bulled, spun and sprinted for 254 yards and two touchdowns when Burbank beat Grant 36-27.And Williams' coach said if he isn't a bulldog, he's something of a very similar bite.""He's my little pit bull,"" Titans coach John Heffernan said. ""He is so relentless. He took us on his back.""Also helping the No. 2 Titans hold off a 15th-seeded Pacers team eager for an upset was quarterback Ernest Jenkins. The junior opened the scoring with a one-yard run and had 141 rushing yards out of the Titans' triple-option attack. Teammate Keith Marcus opened the third quarter with a 66-yard scoring burst for a 13-12 lead. The senior finished with 78 rushing yards.The Burbank defense got two sacks by dominant junior tackle Ngalu Tapa in the fourth quarter. He has a state-leading 22 this season.Calvin Green dashed the final hopes for Grant when he recovered a fumble following a pass reception at the Titans' 44 with 1:12 to go. The Pacers (5-6) suffered just their second losing season since 1990.After Grant's Trayvon Henderson turned a short pass from Isaiah Rios into a 35-yard touchdown to tie the score 19-19 with 1:09 left in the third, Green put Burbank up 26-19 with a five-yard touchdown run with 6:34 left to play.Rios earlier hit Kevin Johnson for a 37-yard touchdown strike for a 12-7 lead.""Hard-fought game, and we knew it would be,"" Williams said. ""I grew up playing football, running the ball. Used to run hills in Pop Warner for the South Sac Vikings. This is so much fun. If we keep playing together, and playing hard, we can keep winning.""In a show of the ongoing rapport and sportsmanship between the schools, Grant coach Mike Alberghini embraced his good friend Heffernan and told him he was pulling for the Titans to run the table.""I have a lot of love and respect for Coach Al, and it's been a great, healthy, fun rivalry,"" Heffernan said. ""I don't think we'd be the program we are today without Grant.  they kicked our butts there for a while in the past. We grew and learned from it.""Next up for Burbank is Pleasant Grove, a 22-21 winner over Stagg of Stockton in a first-round game Friday. Pleasant Grove won the 2010 section title and lost to Granite Bay in last season's final.Heffernan and Pleasant Grove coach Joe Cattolico are longtime pals. Heffernan said Burbank will host Pleasant Grove next Saturday at 1 p.m., enjoying the sudden day-game momentum and understanding that ""my friend Joe hasn't played a day game all year."""\u000a

V"There's officially a new dog in town, and it goes by the name of Franklin Wildcats.In an exceptional display of balance, poise, execution and smothering defense, the visiting No. 2 Wildcats defeated No. 1 Elk Grove 17-7 in a Delta Valley Conference showdown Friday night that really amounts to a title game, and a new measure of bragging rights in town.Elk Grove has played football on its ""new"" campus since 1964 and has educated students for decades before that.Franklin is in its 10th varsity season, rejoicing in its greatest regular-season victory, added momentum and knowing it stalled the Thundering Herd's 17-game regular-season winning streak.""Elk Grove's the big dog, definitely the big dog in this town for a long, long time,"" Franklin coach Mike Johnson said. ""In reality, it's a two-dog town with Pleasant Grove, too, and both have won section titles. To be the best, we've got to beat the best.""And Franklin beat the best Friday as Elk Grove came in ranked No. 1 in the Sac-Joaquin Section and second in Northern California by MaxPreps, with Franklin at No. 2 and 3 in those rankings, respectively.Franklin prevailed because its complete team was a bit better than Elk Grove (7-1, 2-1), which was without two-year starting quarterback Tommy Arnold, who was suspended for a locker-room fight while trying to retrieve his stolen cellphone.The defense of the Wildcats (8-0, 3-0) bunched up the box with nine men, daring the Herd to throw with backup Guy Hall, who completed one pass for three yards off a deflection.Still, even with Arnold at linebacker, his other position, Elk Grove would not have slowed Franklin. The Wildcats outgained the Herd 331-130 in total offense.Christian Fonbuena rushed for 81 yards and Kyran Harris had 65, including the icing 27-yard touchdown run for the final score early in the fourth quarter.Tre Lampley scored on a seven-yard run for Franklin and had 65 receiving yards. Quarterback Trent Spallas passed for 148 yards, connecting with Dionte Young for 97 of them.Led by Joey Banks and William Vi, Franklin has had a strong defense all season, too, a championship unit that allowed the hard-charging Robert Frazier to fight for 83 yards, but they came on 25 carries. Wadus Parker cut Franklin's lead to 10-7 on a nine-yard touchdown run.""My kids were very serious this week in practice, most serious they've been,"" Johnson said. ""We even had Fonbuena and Harris take over on scout team and say, 'No, no, no. Frazier doesn't run like that for Elk Grove. He's much better. We'll show you.' ""Elk Grove aims to finish the regular season 9-1 and target a Division II section title after winning five in D-I. Franklin won its first playoff game last season, at Nevada Union, and now wants much more, such as a D-I title.The baseball team won the D-I North title, and the good vibes of athletic success continue. Franklin packed the visitor's side at Elk Grove with boosters, parents, alumni and students.""Things are going great right now,"" Spallas said."\u000a

V"During late spring, high school seniors' minds often drift toward saying goodbyes, parties and post-graduation frolic.That's not the case for the Bear River softball team. Though nine of the 12 players are seniors, there is little evidence of senioritis among the Bruins.Ninth-ranked Bear River is clearly a team on a mission.After losing four of their first five games to ranked teams, the dialed-in Bruins are 15-5-2.Monday, the Division III Bruins beat D-I Delta River League front-runner Ponderosa 5-3 in a nonleague game. Today, they can clinch the Pioneer Valley League championship with a victory at Center.Bear River hopes to make a deep playoff push after last year's disappointing first-round exit. The players also hope to send coach Duane Zauner into retirement with his fifth Sac-Joaquin Section championship in six seasons.""They really want to be successful,"" Zauner said. ""They're definitely on a mission, especially after what happened last year.""Zauner, 56, has coached at Bear River since the school opened in 1985. He was the baseball coach the first eight years and the softball coach the last 18. He has coached junior varsity football for 22 years.""I'm entering another phase in my life,"" Zauner said. ""I've got three more years in the classroom, but I've got grandkids that are starting to play baseball in the Wheatland area who I'd like to watch play, and I have a granddaughter in Utah who I'd like to be able to visit. It's time to let someone else have all this fun.""But not without one last stand led by scholarship signees Stephanie Ceo, a shortstop headed to the University of Texas, and Alyssa Reina, a catcher, headed for North Dakota State. Both were Bee All-Metro first-team selections as juniors.Reina has been phenomenal both behind and at the plate. She's hitting .614 with 25 RBIs and seven home runs. She has 10 stolen bases and has tossed out 14 baserunners.Ceo, the last of four sisters to play for Zauner, is hitting .458 with five triples, three home runs and 16 stolen bases.Third baseman Cambria Holcomb (.432), first baseman Mackenzie Hollister (.409) and outfielder Ashleigh Higginbotham (.388) also are hitting better than the impressive team average of .387.Seniors Maddie Phelps (6-3, 1.31 ERA) and Erin Nichol (9-2, 0.83 ERA) rotate on the mound, an arrangement Zauner says only works because of the pitchers' unselfishness.Last season, Benicia ousted Bear River 9-2 in the single-elimination opening round of the D-III playoffs. The Bruins had won four consecutive titles in D-IV before moving to D-III in 2011.With an enrollment of a little more than 800 students, Bear River is truly a D-IV school, but it now competes in D-III. The Bruins likely will host a school with at least twice the enrollment when the playoffs begin May 18.""We like the challenge,"" said Zauner, whose 142-25-3 record since 2007 is an area best.Down-to-wire finish  Third-ranked Ponderosa, No. 4 Pleasant Grove, No. 5 Sheldon and No. 6 St. Francis are all top-10 teams, but one will see its season come to a close today without a postseason berth.Only three teams from the Delta River League advance to the playoffs.A St. Francis win today over Ponderosa would force a three-way tie for first among St. Francis, Ponderosa and the winner of today's Sheldon-Pleasant Grove game.A St. Francis loss and a Sheldon loss would give Sheldon the No. 3 playoff spot, based on its two league wins over the Troubadours.A St. Francis loss and a Pleasant Grove loss would lead to section tiebreaker procedures since they split league games.

V"WASHINGTON  The Senate approved a highway bill Wednesday that includes a long-sought provision for the Gulf Coast: A guarantee that 80 percent of the fines collected from the April 2010 BP oil spill  an amount that could reach $20 billion  would be distributed for coastal restoration to the five states along the Gulf of Mexico: Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Texas and Alabama.  While the bill faces an uncertain outlook in the House of Representatives, Gulf state lawmakers are anxious for Congress to adopt the amendment on the so-called RESTORE Act before a settlement is reached with the Department of Justice and BP. I am hopeful that the Senate's overwhelming support for helping Gulf Coast states address long-term environmental and economic damages will be fairly considered by the House of Representatives, said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. The nation needs an extended highway bill, and Gulf Coast states need assurance that Congress will allow them to have resources to recover from the oil spill. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said, As we approach the two-year anniversary of the Gulf oil spill, I am glad to have helped pass a bill to direct funds to coastal communities that were impacted. Under the Senate bill, the five states would divide 35 percent of the money equally, 60 percent would be directed to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council and 5 percent would go to a new Gulf science and fisheries program. The House-passed version of the amendment doesn't specify how the money would be distributed. If Congress doesn't act, the fines collected would go to the Treasury. I join with our senators in celebrating the fact that a majority on both sides of the Capitol have now committed to bringing most of the Clean Water Act fines back to the states affected by this tragedy, Rep. Steven Palazzo, R-Miss., said in a statement. These BP fine monies are vital in ensuring the long-term environmental and economic recovery of the Gulf Coast.

V"There's so much talent at Sacramento High that the top-ranked Dragons continue to win even when a key player is injured.Last season it was wing Allie Green, who missed her junior year with a knee injury as the Dragons won their second consecutive Sac-Joaquin Section Division III championship.This year it's senior guard Casey Williams.Williams, who has signed with Fullerton State, won't play for the Dragons because of a right shoulder injury. Surgery is scheduled today.But Sacramento has shown its depth in its 4-0 start, which includes a 58-42 win over Brookside Christian of Stockton in the championship game of the St. Hope Classic on Dec. 8. Brookside is the defending CIF state Division V champion.Dragons junior guard Chaya Durr, the Metro Conference MVP in girls volleyball, has been impressive in basketball, too, averaging 16 points.Pepperdine-bound Green is scoring in double figures, while 6-foot-4 Ayanna Edwards continues to develop into one of the section's most dominant shot blockers and rebounders. Coach Michele Massari says Edwards is a college recruiting target, not just for her size and athleticism but also her strong grades.Junior guard Zonyia Cormier (7.9 points, 2.8 steals last season) also returns and 6-2 senior Breanna Garrett, the sister of former Sacramento High star and current Santa Clara player Robert Garrett, provides depth inside.Sacramento will play in this weekend's Nike Tournament of Champions in Phoenix, then Dec. 27-31 in the West Coast Jamboree in Antioch. The Dragons open league play Jan. 4 at No. 7 Florin.Titan recruits  College recruiters are spending a lot of time at Antelope High School these days.Gabe Bealer, a 6-5 wing, and Isaiah Ellis, a 6-6 forward-wing, are getting looks and offers from a number of mid-major schools, but it's not just the boys who are being watched.Isaiah's twin, 6-1 Tyler, averages 20 points and 18 rebounds for the girls team.Isaiah and Tyler have talked about attending the same college; girls coach Sean Chambers says Sacramento State is the only school so far to offer scholarships to both.Multi-talented Mustang  No. 12 Monterey Trail, the defending Delta Valley Conference champions, are off to a 6-2 start, and a lot of credit goes to 5-5 senior guard Qiana Levy.The returning all-league player leads the team in scoring (17.6 points) and rebounding (6.3) and is second in steals (5.4) and assists (4.3).Coach Louie Corpuz, who has worked with her since seventh grade, said Levy is a phenomenal student and a leader on and off the court, finds time to work as a volunteer coach at Edward Harris Jr. Middle School and is in Monterey Trail's Impulse Dance Company.Miners on the move  Nevada Union ended No. 8 Del Oro's 63-game Sierra Foothill League winning streak last season. Now the No. 13 Miners hope to stop Del Oro's eight-year reign as league champions, too.The Miners, 9-3, won the Napa Wine Country Tournament on Saturday, beating Morro Bay 52-38 in the championship game behind Nicole Lierly's 18 points.Nevada Union has three challenging home games coming up: No. 20 Colfax on Thursday, No. 3 Christian Brothers on Saturday and No. 12 Monterey Trail on Jan. 4."\u000a

V"Lisa Lacy carries a great deal of ambition for her Images Theatre Company, both in the present and the near future.This weekend, Images opens its production of Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama ""Ruined"" with Lacy in the central role of Mama Nadi.Lacy hopes the production can propel Images into a greater public consciousness as she moves the company toward professional status.As the co-founding executive director of Images, Lacy has guided her small company since 2003, along with co-founder Charles Cooper, a composer and lyricist.The two initially came together in 2002 as co- creators of the California Musical Theatre's Martin Luther King Jr. Project productions ""Keeping the Dream Alive"" and ""And the Dream Goes On,"" both of which were written with Anthony D'Juan.Lacy and Cooper continued forming Images, and producing plays as well as their own original musicals. The musicals were more financially viable and allowed the company to build a dedicated audience as it bounced around theaters. It settled at Oak Park's Guild Theater in 2008. The pair staged their own shows such as ""We Come From Greatness"" and ""Legacy"" while Lacy, an Equity actor, performed in shows such as ""IPH (Iphigenia at Aulis),"" produced by San Francisco's African-American Shakespeare Company, and as Aunt Ester in the Sacramento Theatre Company's production of August Wilson's ""Gem of the Ocean."" Lacy has all along had the vision of Images eventually becoming Sacramento's first professional African American theater company. To be successful she'll have to deal with the major challenge that other emerging professional companies have here: finding the appropriate venue.""We've been around now for nine years, and we're not going anywhere anytime soon,"" Lacy said.""We need someplace we can call our own that we can afford to be in all the time.""For this production of ""Ruined"" the company rehearsed in another space for several weeks before moving to the Guild to save on rental costs. Of course, working in the theater is quite different than in a rehearsal space, and director Buddy Butler has spent valuable time restaging the production for the Guild's stage.The drama and intensity of ""Ruined"" come through its visceral representation of a world very foreign to most of us.Lacy's Mama Nadi runs a combination brothel and bar in a remote rural mining town at the edge of Congo's jungle. Her customers include miners, government soldiers, guerrilla militiamen, arms merchants and even a charming traveling salesman. Mama Nadi has to carefully avoid offending anyone and must make friends with all sides while threats of sudden violence pervade just about every scene. ""I saw the production at Berkeley Rep and thought this is something I have to do in Sacramento,"" Lacy said.""It is such a critical work and important story to tell about what goes on in the world and what happens to other people. We see snippets of it on the news, but rarely go into the details of it and realize how blessed we are.""RUINEDWHAT:Images Theatre Company presents Lynn Nottage's Pulitzer Prize- winning drama about women in the lawless war-ravaged Congo.WHERE: The Guild Theater, 2828 35th St. (35th and Broadway), SacramentoWHEN: Previews at 8 p.m. today and Saturday, opening at 3 p.m. Sunday.

V"Patience, poise, four touchdowns by Kyran Harris and a whole lot of last-play prayer.That was the recipe for Franklin High School on a wild Friday night in Del Paso Heights in a Delta Valley League opener that stamps the continued rise of The Bee No. 2-ranked Wildcats of Elk Grove and the sudden on-the-brink status of the Grant Pacers.Charging back in the fourth quarter behind quarterback Isaiah Rios' three touchdown passes, Grant lined up for a potential game-winning field goal with two seconds left. Jorge Vega was the hero two weeks ago after his last-play boot downed Del Oro. This time, there was no celebration for the Pacers. There was Grant despair and Franklin euphoria.Robert Sanders blocked the attempt, and Dionte Young scooped it up and raced 85 yards for a touchdown with no time left for a 34-26 victory over the stunned No. 15 Pacers.""It's like being a defensive end  you have to get around the edge and get in there to have a chance to block it,"" said Sanders, who blocked a field goal earlier this season against Cosumnes Oaks. ""We needed it.""Franklin (6-0, 1-0) faces more tests in the DVC, none bigger than at top-ranked Elk Grove in 13 days.Grant, meanwhile, is on the brink of something seemingly unthinkable in this region: missing the postseason. The Pacers (2-4, 0-1) must win out, including Friday against Elk Grove, to have a chance of extending their Sac-Joaquin Section-leading streak of 22 consecutive playoff berths.But if Friday's spirited effort was a glimpse, there's still a lot of fight left in the Pacers, a program rocked by tragedy this fall and finding normalcy in football gear.First it was the news of the murder-suicide involving popular longtime assistant coach Ed Coleman. Then it was the news of former Grant player and current Sacramento State defensive end John Bloomfield lapsing into a coma following lung surgery on Sept. 19. His family will take him off life support today.On Wednesday, the Pacers family was floored again with news that 77-year-old Kia Vue  the grandmother of Grant's all-time career kicking scorer Charlie Vue  was found dead in her Robla apartment, beaten and strangled. Charlie Vue graduated from Grant in the spring and now attends UC Davis. Vega, the current Grant kicker, replaced Charlie Vue this season.""October will define us, our character and pride,"" Grant defensive coordinator Reggie Harris said. ""We've still got a lot left.""Franklin went with a no-huddle attack and power football.Harris bulled and sprinted his way for 137 yards. He had first-half touchdowns of 8, 5 and 17 yards and opened the second half with a 70-yard burst for a 28-13 lead. Rios hit Trayvon Henderson for Grant scores of 48 and 15 yards and found Treivon Brooks from eight yards out with 51 seconds to go to cut it to 28-26. Grant recovered the onside kick, and three plays later set up its last chance."\u000a

V"In the first five years since becoming a city in 2000, the wide-open ranching territory of Elk Grove grew at a dizzying pace, adding thousands of homes and families, stretching its boundaries and prompting plans for a regional mall.By 2007, Elk Grove's economy had begun to slide. In the next couple of years, one in five homes went through foreclosure, businesses fled the city, poverty and homelessness spread, and nothing but a concrete-and-steel shell of the planned Promenade mall is left as a reminder of the boom times.This tumultuous economic climate marked the first few years of Gary Davis' tenure on the Elk Grove City Council. After serving on the council for six years, Davis won a landslide victory last month to become Elk Grove's first directly elected mayor. He will be sworn in Dec. 12.Davis, 38, married father of three, is a lobbyist for an educational reform group.What do you feel are your most important accomplishments while on the City Council?Transforming the culture within City Hall to be more resident- and business-friendly. As an example, six years ago, Elk Grove was rated as the worst city in the region to do business. The past two years in a row, we have sliced red tape, lowered fees and have a can-do attitude toward bringing new, high-quality jobs to Elk Grove. One result of this transformation is the recent location of our first state agency (California Correctional Health Care Services.) Over 1,500 jobs came along.What does the new role of mayor mean for Elk Grove?Elk Grove has the opportunity to play a larger role on the regional stage with a directly elected mayor. Doing so can bring tremendous economic opportunities to Elk Grove  . I always point to West Sacramento as an example. They decided to elect their own mayor, and Mayor (Christopher) Cabaldon has been an effective mayor. They built the River Cats stadium and have started to develop their riverfront. I feel like it has enabled them to rise above a difficult past. Why did you decide to run for mayor?I have big plans for our city. I feel like we've done a lot in the last few years to turn it around and get back on track. I was mayor in 2008, under the system of rotating among council members, and I understand, with that title, how we can elevate some priorities.What are a few of your most significant goals as mayor?First, fixing our jobs-to-housing imbalance. We have 156,000 residents and only 30,000 jobs. This is not healthy, nor is it sustainable. Our future quality of life depends on thousands of new jobs coming to Elk Grove. Second, I want to work closely with our locally owned businesses to ensure they thrive and grow. Third, Elk Grove is ready for large civic amenities. I will be working hard to bring a large sports complex, university, performing arts center and other civic amenities.What do you foresee happening with the partially built Elk Grove Promenade, the mall that was abandoned by developers?The current owner of the property, Howard Hughes Corp., is telling us they're trying to get it finished. And I believe them to a certain extent. The challenge is, you need 40 to 50 high-end retailers to open a mall of that size. Nationally, retailers are in a wait-and-see mode. As mayor, I believe I can play a role in pushing (Howard Hughes Corp.) to be more aggressive. They want letters of intent before they build, but I believe if you build, retailers will be more likely to sign letters of intent.Is there a Plan B?I'm open to alternatives to a mall on the site. We need it to be an amenity for Elk Grove. I would be interested if we were approached by a private university or corporate campus. But the fact is, for now, it's zoned for a regional mall.What's your position on the Southeast Policy Area? The 1,200-acre site is the last large-scale development area within the urbanized portion of Elk Grove. That's a prime opportunity for our community to fix the jobs-to-housing imbalance. I'm looking to build civic and cultural amenities and designate significant square footage for professional offices. It could be decades away from build-out. But the city leader of today should be engaged in long-term planning. The city has applied to annex about 7,900 acres south of the policy area. Where are you on annexation?If Elk Grove is going to become the city we want to be, we've got to be looking long-term. I don't think rescinding would be prudent planning. I did, however, lead the charge to scale back the acreage. The original application submitted in 2008 was twice the size. I'm a big believer in regional planning, and a regional blueprint that many agencies have crafted calls for Elk Grove to be bigger. I'm open to discussions to where the ultimate line would be."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/15/5193914/stoppage-time-rogers-announcement.html,"This was the moment that the soccer world has been waiting for, right?An active player in the prime of his career announcing that he is gay and bravely stepping forward as the face of a campaign to bring tolerance to the sport.Yet, just as soon as former Columbus Crew midfielder Robbie Rogers made public the fact that he is gay on his personal blog on Friday, he also became a retired player in the same breath.""I always thought I could hide this secret,"" Rogers said on his blog. ""Football was my escape, my purpose, my identity. Football hid my secret, gave me more joy than I could have ever imagined. I will always be thankful for my career.""Rogers went on to talk about how he feels like a ""free man"" after the announcement with a new lease on life.And while finally coming out has to be a massive weight lifted from his shoulders, it really does nothing to further the cause of gay players in soccer.At 25, Rogers still had a potentially full career ahead of him after a successful start in MLS with the Crew from 2007-11.Rogers earned 18 caps with the United States national team and had the potential to work his way into the future plans of U.S. head coach Jurgen Klinsmann.He failed to impress during a short spell at Leeds United in England, which was followed by a loan stint at lower-division club Stevenage.A return to MLS would have given him a chance to bounce back on the field while having the support of his friends and family in this country after making his announcement.Rogers obviously wanted no part of leading a crusade to help gay players gain acceptance in the game, and it is hard to criticize him for that.But by walking away at the same time he came out, he almost does more to hurt the cause.Germany international Philipp Lahm was rumored to be gay around the time he released a book in 2011, but he vehemently denied the rumors and even advised against gay players coming out.Lahm specifically referred to Justin Fashanu, who was the first professional player in England to come out publicly while being an active player in the 1990's.Fashanu later discussed how deeply-rooted the anti-gay prejudice in the game is before taking his own life in 1998.Figures within the game have spoken recently about how they believe that an openly-gay player would be supported, not criticized, if he came out.Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard spoke on this topic in a blog for a Danish betting site.""Homosexuals are in need of a hero,"" Lindegaard said in his blog which was distributed by the Telegraph. ""They are in need of someone who dares to stand up for their sexuality. But homosexuality in football is a taboo subject and the atmosphere on the pitch and in the stands is tough.""As a footballer, I think a homosexual colleague would be afraid of the reception he could get from the fans, but my impression is that the players would not have a problem accepting a homosexual.""Rogers doesn't seem like someone who came out to be a hero, rather a man who was looking to get something off his chest.Yet, by choosing to retire rather than continue playing, Rogers sends the message that the game is not yet ready to embrace a gay player."\u000a

V"PANAMA CITY  Florida will not join Alabama, Louisiana and more than 800 other plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit against Transocean, the operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico a year ago, causing a massive oil spill, Gov. Rick Scott announced Tuesday.Instead, the state will file a claim against BP directly, a move the Florida Attorney Generals Office says will be resolved more quickly  and inexpensively for the state.It doesnt make sense for the state to join that lawsuit, Scott said. We have a plan to make sure that our state is treated fairly with regard to getting reimbursed by British Petroleum for the damages to our state.The decision to miss Wednesdays deadline to join the suit could leave Florida unable to pursue Transocean or take part in any findings by the court, but does not affect its ability to go after BP for losses, said Corey Maze, deputy attorney general for Alabama, which is coordinating the New Orleans litigation for the Gulf states.Critics have railed against Scott and Attorney General Pam Bondi for not taking legal action against companies responsible for the Deepwater Horizon disaster despite being in office for four months.Read the full story at MiamiHerald.com"\u000a

V"Guillermo Salazar feels bad that Christian Mahaffey and two assistants lost their jobs as Rio Americano High School football coaches.Yet it was the starting wide receiver-defensive end's request to miss an Oct. 13 home game against Whitney to attend a high school baseball showcase in Arizona that ultimately led to the coaches' firing Tuesday by Rio Americano principal Brian Ginter.The coaches opposed Ginter's decision to reinstate 11 players who had left the team in support of Salazar.Mahaffey's firing left Salazar conflicted. On one hand, he appreciated that most of his fellow senior teammates were willing to put the rest of their high school football careers on the line to support him.On the other hand, he respected Mahaffey and his assistants for their resolute stand.Mahaffey was aware that Salazar's top priority was baseball. It's his favorite sport  he also plays basketball for the Raiders  and one in which he thinks he can earn a scholarship.""(Mahaffey) knew I was a baseball guy first, and if there was any conflict between football and baseball, I'd choose baseball,"" Salazar said.Mahaffey was agreeable, allowing Salazar to miss three weeks of summer practices and one practice after the fall season started, to play travel baseball.""When I grew up, you played two or three sports, and that's the way it should be,"" Mahaffey said before his release. ""But now there's all the extra stuff  fall baseball, fall basketball, combines, camps. Once we hit fall, and our kids start playing, the focus has to be football.""Salazar agreed to Mahaffey's request that he participate in the Raiders' football camp at the end of June in Madera, passing on a key Stockton baseball showcase that draws nearly 50 college recruiters.Coming off a junior season in which he was an All-Capital Athletic League selection, Salazar, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound pitcher-corner infielder, was playing well and had the attention of nearly a dozen colleges, according to Dan Sozzi, his club travel coach.""Before the camp, he was hitting the ball as well as any kid who has ever played for me,"" said Sozzi, who has been putting together elite travel teams since 2001.But at the football camp, Salazar injured his back. It plagued him throughout the rest of the summer, affecting his swing in baseball.When school started and the football season got under way, Salazar still had no college baseball scholarship offers.But there was still the Fall Showcase Classic on Oct. 11-14 in Peoria, Ariz. The event is held at the multi-field complex shared by the San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners.It's one of the biggest and most prestigious showcase events in the nation, last year drawing more than 400 college coaches and 30 major-league scouts.This year's event is even more important because it's one of Salazar's last chances to land a college scholarship by the national letter-of-intent signing day in February. He also has been invited to try out for the Fall Classic's prestigious All-Academic Game on Oct. 11 for players with grade-point averages of 3.5 or better. Salazar maintains a 3.8 GPA.But while Salazar's parents long ago had paid for their son to attend the event, Salazar realized he had neglected to tell Mahaffey.When he finally did, Mahaffey gave him the choice  either play in the Oct. 13 football game or quit the team.""I thought he reacted the way any head coach would,"" Salazar said. ""I'd hoped to just miss the game and be able to continue to play (football). But he made his decision, and I respected it. I was going to turn in my pads the next day.""That's when 11 of his senior teammates stepped in and gave Mahaffey the ""either he plays, or we walk"" ultimatum that led to his coaching dismissal.""I'm happy I'm still playing (football), but I'm not happy that the coaches lost their jobs,"" said Salazar, who called Mahaffey after his dismissal."\u000a

V"The Elk Grove City Council, struggling to end gridlock in filling a council vacancy, failed Wednesday night to choose any of the five remaining candidates and, instead, called for former Elk Grove Unified School District Superintendent Robert Trigg to fill the post.The action, in a 3-1 vote with Councilman Jim Cooper opposed, required a city staff member to call Trigg today to ask if he would agree to serve out the nearly two years left on the council seat vacated by then-Councilman Gary Davis after he was elected mayor in November.Trigg retired from the school district in July 1995 after 35 years in education. He apparently had not sought the council seat, and he was not in attendance at the council meeting.Councilman Pat Hume said he decided to propose Trigg after seeing his name posed in print by the publisher of the Elk Grove Citizen.""I think there is something to be said for getting behind somebody who is not seeking the office,"" Hume said. ""It allows us to not have a special election. Frankly, he has been vetted. It's his track record and his experience in the community.""Both Hume and Mayor Davis said they had talked to Trigg on the phone about the idea.Councilman Steve Detrick said he was open to Trigg and provided the third vote. He said after the meeting that he had not yet talked to Trigg about the position.Cooper erupted in frustration at the Trigg proposal, noting that it was bypassing a process that council members had established to fill the seat.Both Cooper and Davis two weeks ago were steadfast in their support of city Planning Commissioner Nancy De Anda Chaires. At the same time, Hume and Detrick had sought other candidates. Hume complained that there was a perception that the process for Chaires had been tainted by comments backers had made on her behalf. On Wednesday night, Detrick agreed.But Cooper said efforts to line up Trigg were no better than what Hume complained was being done on behalf of Chaires.Further, Cooper said, the Trigg proposal was without public vetting since Trigg's name was raised after the public comment period closed.""There was a complete lack of public input in this process,"" Cooper said. ""That is not transparency. He is a good guy. But that is not the way it should be done.""Hume has said repeatedly that the ""tainting"" was not of Chaires' doing.Council members had faced an unrelenting deadlock in trying to select one of six candidates who applied for the vacancy. A solution was needed to avoid putting the question before voters at a cost of more than $550,000, several said. The earliest an election could be held is June 4, raising the prospect of months more of gridlock.The City Council deadlocked at least five times on five candidates.In addition to the split vote for Chaires, the council on Jan. 9 deadlocked over Oscar Portillo O'con, Jeffrey Sherwood Owen and David Glenn Conner. Owen later withdrew.And on Wednesday night, the council split 2-2 on Edward J. Busuttil, a San Joaquin County assistant district attorney.The only other candidate among the remaining five was LaWanna Montgomery, a teacher and president/CEO of Reach Learning Center who ran for City Council in 2004 and 2008. Montgomery had asked council members earlier Wednesday night to call a special election."\u000a

V"Sixth-ranked Placer is undefeated and has three players who have verbally committed to play at four-year colleges, including national recruit Eddie Vanderdoes.They also are Cal-Hi Sports' front-runners to play in the inaugural CIF Northern California regional playoffs Dec. 7-8.But with No. 14 Center (8-1, 4-0 Pioneer Valley League) coming to Auburn on Friday night, the Hillmen (9-0, 4-0) still haven't won everyone over.There are questions about the Hillmen's suddenly sputtering wing-T offense that averaged nearly 53 points through the first six games and just 16 points in the past three PVL games. That includes a 14-7 win over Bear River and a 10-7 win over Lincoln, in which Dominic Granieri kicked a late game-winning field goal.Although they beat rival and two-time defending league champion Colfax 24-7 Friday, the Hillmen's defense starred by forcing six turnovers and making five sacks.Placer's defense has 34 sacks, 18 interceptions and 11 fumble recoveries. Leading the way have been 6-foot-3, 302-pound defensive tackle Vanderdoes (eight sacks); 6-4, 225-pound defensive end Stone Sander (six sacks), who has made a verbal commitment to Sacramento State; and 6-4, 185-pound back Isaiah Piniero (eight interceptions).In recent weeks, Center has has showcased the more dazzling offense.Behind speedy running back D'Juan Bellaire and quarterback Tyrel Anderson, the Cougars averaged 36 points against Lincoln, Colfax and Bear River.Center routed Bear River 36-0 on Oct. 19 as Bellaire rushed for 173 yards and four touchdowns and the Cougars forced five turnovers and had six sacks.In the Cougars' 34-14 win over Colfax on Oct. 12, Bellaire and Anderson combined for 308 total yards and six touchdowns.""We have great overall team speed,"" said Center athletic director John Gallagher, a former Cougars football coach. ""We have only two or three linemen over 220 pounds, but we are quick off the ball and able to create seams for the running backs.  It will be the classic speed vs. size battle. It's what makes high school football fun to watch.""Thunder contributor  Rocklin senior Daniel Kniffin started the season at quarterback before being sidelined by shoulder issues.His backup, junior Logan Webb, has since developed into a star for the No. 10 Thunder, throwing for four touchdowns in each of the past three Sierra Foothill League games.But the 6-3, 180-pound Kniffin, who coach Greg Benzel says is perhaps the team's best athlete, is still a big contributor now that he's healthy.He had five catches for 88 yards and a touchdown in a 42-17 win over Woodcreek on Oct. 19 and seven catches for 118 yards and two touchdowns in a 49-14 victory over Roseville on Friday.Tow's big game  Union Mine's Sean Tow entered the season looking to become the first running back in section history to have three successive 2,000-yard seasons.But he missed the team's first two games with injuries, and Union Mine doesn't have the formidable offensive line of past seasons.On Friday, though, Tow surpassed the 1,000-yard mark with a 370-yard, four-touchdown performance in a 53-28 win over El Dorado, only the Diamondbacks' second victory in nine games.Tow has a career rushing total of 5,540 yards entering Friday's season finale against No. 16 Vista del Lago.Falcons soar  Jalen Walker caught three touchdown passes, Avante Yarber rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown, and Brendan Gormley had an interception and one of eight sacks for Christian Brothers in its 48-28 win over Casa Roble in a Capital Valley Conference game Saturday at Hughes Stadium.One season after finishing 1-9, the Falcons (5-4, 2-2) can qualify for the postseason with a win Friday over Bella Vista at Hughes."\u000a

And then he pulled away on the streets of downtown Sacramento, crossing the finish line at 9th Street and Capitol Mall in 2 hours, 16 minutes and 29 seconds to win the 30th annual race.Alisha Williams of Colorado Springs, Colo., won the women's race in 2:34:57, breaking away from the Bay Area's Clara Peterson in the last two miles to become the first American since Kristin Schwartz in 2000 to win the CIM.Tapia became the first American to win the men's race since Joseph LeMay in 1999.With runners falling off the pack along the tree-lined stretches of Fair Oaks Boulevard, Tapia said he waited to make a move until two others  Ethiopia's Tesfaye Alemayehu and Kenya's Christopher Kipyego  made theirs around mile 24.""They went and nobody else went with them,"" Tapia said. ""I was like, I'm going to go with them and just gamble, and if I die, I die. At least I'm still going to be (in the) top three unless I completely hit the wall.""I did and I just felt strong.""Until then, Tapia said, he had been unusually patient. On a storm-tossed morning that brought out only the hardiest of spectators, a big group of the top runners stayed together for most of the race, none wanting to tackle the Folsom-to-Sacramento course alone.""If it would've been 35 degrees with no head wind, I probably would've gone out fast like I did for my previous three marathons, and I probably would've tanked at the end,"" said Tapia, a student at the Monterey College of Law.Instead, Tapia had enough left at the end to open a comfortable lead as he approached the Capitol, even hazarding a glance or two over his shoulder. Alemayehu finished second in 2:17:06, and Kipyego third with a time of 2:17:59.Tapia, who finished 24th at the U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials in January in a personal-best time of 2:15:28, said he hadn't expected to collect the $10,000 winner's check, one of which also went to Williams. He said he was sick last week until Thursday, and his initial goal of finishing in 2:13 went away with the weather forecasts.""Yesterday, I told some of the guys, man, if I'd have known it was like this, I wouldn't have come,"" Tapia said, smiling. ""But I'm glad I came.""Williams planned to run the New York City Marathon until its cancellation in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Shifting to the CIM required her to stay in race shape for a month more, and Williams admitted she was worried about the final six miles.""We probably did about five marathon-specific workouts between New York and now, but I only got one long run in and it wasn't good,"" Williams, 30, said. ""But my coach said don't panic.  I felt really good the last six miles.""Williams, a financial analyst, beat her time from her only previous marathon  the Olympic Trials, where she also ran with Peterson, of San Anselmo. The two kept pace Sunday until about mile 24, Williams said, when she made a push for the end.""I was terrified. I did not relax at all the last two miles,"" Williams said. ""I had no idea where she was, and I know how good of a runner she is.""Peterson finished in 2:35:35, followed by Natalia Sergeeva, who placed third with a time of 2:38:22.

V"TUCSON, Ariz.  The move was vintage Josiah Turner. Zipping through the merest of creases, Turner broke from the left side of the key through the defense for a blow-by, left-handed layup late against UCLA two weeks ago.Turner's basket was part of a critical 12-4 run in the final four minutes of Arizona's 65-63 victory that all but clinched the Wildcats' first-round bye in the Pacific-12 Conference tournament, which begins today at Los Angeles' Staples Center.In several ways, the play stood for Turner's freshman season  a late, aggressive move after times of uncertainty.The most highly recruited player in Arizona's celebrated freshman class, Turner has combined flashes of athleticism this season with some off-court growing pains.In a way, his first season in college has mimicked his senior year at Sacramento High School, where he was dismissed from the team in mid-January before surfacing at the Quality Education Academy, a prep school power in Winston-Salem, N.C.Turner, 6-foot-3, has turned it up lately, playing some of his best basketball after one last misadventure, when he was suspended and not allowed to travel to the Wildcats' game at then-No. 12 Florida on Dec. 7. Turner missed practice earlier that week when he locked himself out of his dorm room after showering, he said. Wildcats coach Sean Miller, if he bought it, was not going to let it slide.""He's tough,"" said Turner, who also was late for a team shootaround before a Nov. 9 game against Duquesne. ""He is not letting me get away with things.""The tough love appears to have had an effect, maybe because Turner understood Miller meant business. Miller kicked another prize freshman, power forward Sidiki Johnson, off the team Nov. 21 for violating team rules.Turner, by all accounts, has been a model teammate since, working back into the starting lineup in the second game of the Pac-12 schedule after getting a career-high five steals off the bench in the conference opener against Arizona State on Dec. 31.He had his best game of the season against USC on Feb. 23, scoring a season-high 15 points with six assists, three rebounds and two steals in 31 minutes. He had a career-high seven assists against Utah on Feb. 11 and has had three of his four double-figure scoring games since mid-January.It has marked a steady growth for a freshman who was considered the No. 3 point guard recruit and the No. 13 player overall in the 2011 high school class by Scout.com.""I'm just trying to be more aggressive,"" Turner said. ""When I am open, shoot it. It's not hard, but you have to feel it out.""Miller has seen progress from Turner, who averaged 27.9 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.5 assists as a junior at Sac High. This season, he is averaging 6.8 points, 3.1 rebounds and 2.4 assists entering Arizona's Pac-12 tournament opener Thursday against the winner of today's UCLA-USC game.""No question about it,"" Miller said when asked if he believed the suspension was a turning point.""It was a moment in time he had to ask himself some tough questions. What you hope is that a young guy like him responds, and that's exactly what he did. The light shines different for freshmen. Some guys get off to a real fast start and as the season progresses they have that valley. With Josiah, you see a guy who has made improvement by inches.""He's a very unselfish kid, sometimes to a fault. We've really tried to instill an aggressive nature in him, because I believe not only is he a better player when he is in an attacking frame of mind, but so is our team.""Once considered a ""one-and-done"" player headed for the NBA after his freshman season, Turner will return to Arizona next season.""I'm going back,"" he said. ""I think I need another year to get stronger, bigger and quicker, and just play a lot more basketball. I have to improve in staying aggressive and being more consistent.""Turner's decision to remain in college also will give him a chance to improve his outside shooting, USC coach Kevin O'Neill said. Like many true point guards, Turner has a pass-first mindset. He is especially proficient in delivering the ball to the low post off a high screen.""I think he is very skilled,"" O'Neill said. ""I don't think he shoots the ball like he needs to, but he will. These guys always shoot better as they go along. ""I like his attack mode. He has a good body. I don't think he is a 'one-and-done'  or whatever it might be with these guys, but I think he is a guy that down the line could be a really good player."""\u000a

The fellow, wearing an official-looking jacket, would pull up to stalled motorists on the freeway and offer help, saying he was with the California Highway Patrol. He'd collect some money for parts, and then drive off, never to be seen again.CHP officials say the service patrol, sponsored by the CHP and state Department of Transportation, uses clearly marked tow trucks and pickup trucks. Service patrol employees will give drivers a gallon of gas, if needed, as well as change tires, tape up leaking hoses, refill radiators and jump-start vehicles. If necessary, they will tow cars to specially designated CHP sites, not to private shops.And they don't ask for money.Street sign squintingReader Roger Bendix, a Sacramento County resident, is perplexed. He's seen county workers replacing street name signs with new versions that no longer are in all capital letters. The new body lettering is, to his eyes, a little harder to read.What's up, he asks? And at what cost?The story starts in Washington, D.C. A few years ago, the feds decided to require cities and counties to switch to street sign styles that would be easier for older drivers to read and more reflective at night.The combination of upper and lower case letters apparently creates contrast that makes lettering stand out. The feds later backed off on deadlines for getting that done, recognizing that local governments are facing tough economic times.But Sacramento County officials  seeing the writing on the wall  are slowly switching out old signs in residential areas so they won't have to scramble later to comply.By doing it incrementally, they make it part of their regular maintenance and repair budget, said John Ronkowski, a senior maintenance manager.But as reader Bendix reports, legibility is in the eye of the beholder: ""The new signs are harder to see.""The county's Ronkowski said he understands.""I can see the contrast,"" he said. ""It works. But you might say, 'Ah, that looks better' or not.""Super Bowl falloutState highway safety officials are concerned about what will happen on the roads this Sunday  Super Bowl evening  especially in Northern California, 49er country, where there will be plenty of parties, each filled with anxious and excited fans who just might in fact over-imbibe.Designate your own personal sober driver, someone to stand on the sidelines, so to speak, kind of like poor Alex Smith.

""All week long, I didn't have a warm, fuzzy feeling. There's always the unknown when you play teams you haven't seen.""Alexander, however, had a much better feeling after his Thundering Herd beat Lincoln of Stockton 3-0 Saturday.For Elk Grove, that means some extra breathing room in the highly competitive tournament as it switches to double elimination after the first round.Alexander had a right to be worried. He starts six underclassmen, including sophomore pitcher Kimberly Wilburn. But against Lincoln, they played like veterans.Sophomore Serena Sandhu, whom Alexander elevated from the junior varsity late in the season, hit a two-run homer; Wilburn had a sacrifice fly, scattered five hits and struck out three; and the Thundering Herd made only one error.""I've got a big bark and big bite normally during the season, but at this point, the kids have to play the game,"" Alexander said. ""I tell them, 'I ride you all year long to prepare for this day.'

V"Monstrous dragons will descend on Sacramento next week.Think two dozen Day-Glo, 2-ton, scads-of-scales, 20-foot-long behemoths with spiny tails, mischievous reptilian eyes, 40-foot wingspans and stalactite-length incisors. Now visualize them wheeling overhead, belching smoke and brimstone and, in one case, chewing up a chair and excreting it as wood-chip confetti.That's just part of the ""How To Train Your Dragon Live Spectacular,"" assaulting the senses at Sleep Train Arena from Thursday through Jan. 6.""You're visually and physically stimulated the whole show,"" said Riley Miner, a 19-year-old Los Angeles-based actor who is one of two playing Hiccup, the production's human star.""The amount of technology in our show is more than in any other production in the history of theater,"" Miner said.This live version of ""How To Train Your Dragon"" is a collaboration between DreamWorks, maker of the Oscar-nominated 2010 animated film of the same name, and Global Creatures, an Australian firm that previously brought to life the beasties of the BBC series ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" in a live show two years ago.Four years and many millions of dollars in the making, ""Train Your Dragon"" was more fun.""The BBC's 'Walking With Dinosaurs' had to be correct historically,"" said Gavin Sainsbury, who toured the world with ""Dinosaurs"" and is now chief puppeteer for ""How To Train Your Dragon.""""This show, we're talking DreamWorks. Mythical creatures. Comedy. Just on the natural, that's a lot more fun.""There's a reason the show's creators put ""spectacular"" in the title. And it's not just because of the robotic dragons that are the show's centerpiece. There are breakdancing, wall-scaling, rope-suspended Viking villagers. And lasers.And gut-rumbling sound effects.And a rear wall the size of nine movie-theater screens that transforms into rugged woodlands, snow-kissed peaks and boundless, foam-flecked ocean.Images are also projected onto the arena floor while, above, an upside-down, figure-eight monorail allows the show's latex-skinned stars to glide on updrafts or turn, spin and dive at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour.None of the actions of any of the dragons is pre-programmed. The show  just like the name says  is 100 percent live.Helping coordinate this tangle of activity are the folks in the ""Voodoo Lounge"" set high in the arena. Here, members of Sainsbury's team of puppeteers generate the remarkably lifelike behavior of the dragons  several dozen actions and movements per dragon. On the order of 20 different facial expressions.Some of the puppeteers use spinelike metal contraptions with souped-up joysticks to control major physical functions, like wing flapping. Others use modified keyboards to trigger a symphony of sound effects, from snarling to purring.Each large dragon is manned by a team of three puppeteers who manipulate body parts including mouth, wings, eyes, eyelids and tails. In the case of Toothless, there's a fourth puppeteer whose duties include tending to the lead fire breather's evocative ears.Drivers propel the dragons around the magnetized floor. Watch for the camouflaged T-shape between each dragon's feet and legs. The driver is inside.Together, as Miner said, the elements of the production are a sensory smorgasbord.""We know we've done something right when the 8-year-old's jaw drops as well as their parent's,"" said Eric Stevens, head of live entertainment at DreamWorks Animation.One East Coast reviewer wondered what new amazements future live shows will require to trump ""How To Train Your Dragon"" and hold the attention of a 10-year-old for two hours.While the animatronic dragons are central to the oohing and aahing, at the core of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is Hiccup's coming-of-age story. It's complicated a wee bit by Hiccup's befriending of Toothless, not just any old injured dragon but a supposedly vicious Night Fury, and having a father who believes the only good dragon is a dead dragon.Other reviewers from the East Coast, where the show began playing this fall after a tour of Australia earlier in the year, note that the production tends to work best in scenes with fewer actors, like those between Hiccup and Toothless, in which the spectacle doesn't drown out the humanity of the plot's central relationships.Has the animated movie, which grossed $500 million worldwide, been transferred wholesale to the arena? Of course not. Just like the animated movie can't fully do justice to Cressida Cowell's series of books on which it's based.""It's not a word-for-word re-creation of the film,"" Salisbury said. ""DreamWorks did an amazing job of taking the original book and turning that into a film, and the natural progression is adapting that film to the stage.""But Miner stresses that the message is still the same:""Don't jump to conclusions. Treat people and animals and every living thing on this planet with respect, because you can't judge a book by its cover.""HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON LIVE SPECTACULARWhen: 7 p.m. Thursday and Jan. 4, 11 a.m., 3 and 7 p.m. Jan. 5; 1 and 5 p.m. Jan. 6Where: Sleep Train Arena, One Sports Parkway, SacramentoCost: $25-$69.50Information: www.ticketmaster.com, (800) 745-3000"\u000a

V"Twenty-five years ago, Digol J'Beily was a senior quarterback on a 4-year-old Center High varsity team that ventured into the foothills to play Colfax.J'Beily, one of the best athletes in the school's history, led Center on a 14-play, fourth-quarter drive that tied the score 22-22 with 1:24 left. The game ended in a tie, but the Cougars won the tiebreaker that would propel them to the school's first football playoff berth.Fast forward to last Friday night in Colfax, this time with J'Beily as coach.With senior running back D'Juan Bellaire and junior quarterback Tyrel Anderson now the team's stars, No. 19 Center defeated Colfax 34-14 to ruin the perennial power's homecoming and, possibly, its playoff prospects.It was Center's sixth consecutive win and second in the highly competitive Pioneer Valley League. That made the Cougars playoff eligible with three regular-season games still to be played.More importantly, it was a huge boost for a program that lost 35-0 at Colfax in 2010 and 41-14 to the Falcons at home last season and is trying to keep pace with its new neighborhood rival a few miles east in No. 18 Antelope.Center is aiming for at least its first seven-win season since 1999 when it travels to the foothills again Friday to play at Bear River (6-1, 1-1), which lost 14-7 to No. 5 Placer on Friday.Colfax couldn't counter the speed, tenacity and elusiveness of the 5-foot-6, 165-pound Bellaire or 5-9, 160-pound Anderson.Bellaire, breaking tackles throughout the evening, powered his way for 166 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Anderson rushed for 131 yards and two scores and threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Kris Sutton. Anderson also thwarted a Colfax scoring drive with a first-half interception.Bellaire and Anderson are returning all-league players who combined for all but 335 of the Cougars' 3,160 total yards last season, when the Cougars (5-6) lost to Oakdale in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division III playoffs.More accolades for Sperbeck  Folsom coach Kris Richardson wasn't happy that Jesuit quarterback Thomas Sperbeck had 380 total yards, including two 70-plus-yard touchdown scampers, in Folsom's 56-35 win over the Marauders on Saturday.But he wasn't completely surprised, either.""He's a great player,"" Richardson said. ""We had guys in the right spots, but we've got to make the tackle. I've seen Thomas on film, and he does that to everybody. He's a great runner. And he made some great first-half throws to (Jason) Elenberger. That's a great QB-to-wide-receiver combo. Hat's off to him.""He hopes to be back  Despite his ouster as football coach at Rio Americano, Christian Mahaffey says he hasn't soured on coaching another high school program.""I can't see me not coaching,"" Mahaffey said. ""I love it, and I felt we did a great job at Rio. We'll just wait and see, but I'd love to coach at a place that valued football and is into hiring football coaches who also teach on campus.""Mahaffey was off-campus at Rio Americano.

V"It has been a pretty eventful playoff for Rio Americano High School girls soccer coach Jennifer Smiley.On Saturday, she coached the Raiders to a Sac-Joaquin Section Division III championship with a 3-0 win over Capital Athletic League rival Antelope. It was the Raiders' fourth section title in six years and second in a row. So Smiley was plenty happy for her girls, who overcame several early-season injuries and a brief bump in league play en route to their sixth consecutive league title. The Raiders lost to El Camino 2-1, the Raiders' first loss in two seasons. ""That loss humbled us,"" Smiley said. ""We came back stronger, and this team peaked at the right time.""The Raiders (14-1-4) won their last eight matches. They dominated Antelope (19-4-3) in the title game as Lizzie Moulton, Alexa Heinzer and Paige Borgogno scored goals and Elizabeth Hutchinson dominated the midfield.Smiley also gave her newest arrival an assist for good timing. Smiley's first child, Katelyn, was born May 5.""Her due date was not until (today), but she came 15 days early,"" said Smiley, a teacher at Barrett Middle School in Carmichael who recently received a layoff notice. ""She knew exactly when she wanted to come  right after league and before playoffs.""Smiley is a former soccer standout for the Raiders and keeps in tip-top shape, so her players had fun with her pregnancy.""We wouldn't make fun of her, but we'd tease her about being fat, then she'd still out-juggle us in practice,"" said senior co-captain Lauren Elledge. ""She's our baby Raider. It's been so much fun.""Fun describes Smiley's coaching philosophy. With most of Rio Americano's players juggling demanding club commitments and challenging academics, she sees high school play as something precious. ""As a former player, I know how important it is to have fun,"" she said. ""We work hard and play hard, but ultimately we come out to have fun.""

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/12/28/5079256/how-philanthropic-giving-became.html,"It was 15 years ago that Ted Turner needed something interesting to say in a speech  and decided, in a rush, to give away $1 billion. ""I was on my way to New York to make the speech,"" Turner recalled to me. ""I just thought, what am I going to say?"" So, in front of a stunned dinner audience, he announced a $1 billion gift to United Nations causes such as fighting global poverty. In nominal terms, before adjusting for inflation, that semiaccidental donation was, at the time, believed to be the biggest single gift ever made, and it has helped transform philanthropy. Tycoons used to compete for their place on the Forbes and Fortune lists of wealthiest people. If they did give back, it was often late in life and involved museums or the arts. They spent far more philanthropic dollars on oil paintings of women than on improving the lives of real women. Turner's gift helped change that culture, reviving the tradition of great philanthropists like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Turner publicly began needling other billionaires  including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett  to be more generous. That was a breach of etiquette, but it worked. ""It's a starting point for me of this modern era of high-profile big public giving,"" reflected Matthew Bishop, co-author of ""Philanthrocapitalism,"" a terrific book about how the business world is reshaping philanthropy. ""He called on others to step up, which did have a crystallizing effect on others. It allowed journalists and others who were talking to Bill Gates to say: 'Why aren't you giving more?' "" Then they tormented Buffett with the same question. Ultimately, Gates and Buffett made huge contributions that are transforming the struggle against global disease and poverty. My hunch is that Gates will be remembered less for his work on personal computers than for his accomplishments against malaria, AIDS and poverty itself. Gates and Buffett are both now recruiters for the Giving Pledge, which commits zillionaires to give away at least half their wealth. The giving pledge adds to the expectation that those who have won the global jackpot should give something back. Turner channeled his money through the United Nations Foundation, where it was leveraged to get other contributions so as to bring $2 billion to finance causes from malaria to polio, from climate change to family planning. The gift brought new respect to the United Nations and made it increasingly fashionable for billionaires to worry about global poverty.These tycoons bring not just their checkbooks to the table but also a business sensibility that introduces greater rigor and evaluation to the world of bleeding hearts. All this has helped shine a greater spotlight on neglected issues  which, in turn, has led to extraordinary results. A study this month reported that infant mortality around the world dropped by more than half from 1990 to 2010. That's millions of lives saved each year. Of course, not everybody has gotten the memo. Take Donald Trump, who has contributed his name to a foundation but little more. An investigation by the Smoking Gun website described him as possibly ""the least charitable billionaire in the United States,"" for he apparently gave the foundation just $3.7 million  over 20 years. Trump, who has said he is worth $7 billion, is not even the largest contributor to his own foundation. A spokesman for Trump suggested that it would be ""totally incorrect"" to characterize him as uncharitable, saying that he has also donated land in upstate New York for public parks and ""millions of dollars"" to other causes.Turner isn't shy about encouraging others to jump on board. When I asked if he had any advice for my readers, he grew particularly animated: ""You don't have to have any money to make a difference; you can pick up trash walking down the street, and I do that all the time,"" he said. ""You can volunteer your time. You can be a big brother or a big sister."" Look, it makes me a little squeamish to extol a billionaire, for our society already has too much worship of the wealthy  and, in any case, the working poor in America are often more generous in percentage terms (and in volunteering) than those far better off. That said, it warms my heart that a mogul donated $1 billion to enliven a speech, didn't even put his name on the foundation and then let the money quietly save lives around the world. If you're still reading, Donald Trump, it's your move."\u000a

V"The Republican National Convention opened by smacking President Barack Obama with the theme ""We Built it."" To pound that message, Republicans turned to a Delaware businesswoman, Sher Valenzuela, who is also a candidate for lieutenant governor. Valenzuela and her husband built an upholstery business that now employs dozens of workers. Valenzuela presumably was picked to speak so that she could thunder at Obama for disdaining capitalism. Oops. It turns out that Valenzuela relied not only on her entrepreneurial skills but also on  yes, government help. Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group, documented $2 million in loans from the Small Business Administration for Valenzuela's company, plus $15 million in government contracts  mostly noncompetitive ones. In a presentation earlier this year, Valenzuela described government assistance as an entrepreneur's ""biggest 'secret weapon.' "" Someone has set up a parody website, using the name of Valenzuela's company, First State Manufacturing, to mock the Republican message. The site, FirstStateManufacturing.com, declares, ""Thank God government was there for me."" In short, the Republicans are inadvertently underscoring the point that Obama was expressing in his ""you didn't build that"" comment in July. Obama noted then that ""if you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own."" He pointed to public investments in roads and bridges that enable businesses to flourish, and then he inelegantly added, ""If you've got a business, you didn't build that."" Fox News erupted in outrage, selectively editing the clip to confirm Republican prejudices that Obama doesn't understand the private sector. This fits into the Republican narrative that business executives are heroic job creators when they aren't held back by regulations and taxes imposed by quasi-socialist Muslims born in Kenya. Democrats tried to highlight a flaw in that narrative when they released a new ad pointing to Mitt Romney's outsourcing of jobs and telling him, ""You didn't build that  you destroyed it."" Yet to me, that Democratic line of attack on Romney as a serial job destroyer feels unfair. Sometimes the way to save a company is to cut labor costs or outsource jobs, and almost nobody wants to ban trade or overseas production even though they can cost jobs. What is fair is to observe that the Republicans' claim that they are the great job creators is a fiction. Robert S. McElvaine of Millsaps College examined employment data for the 64 years from the beginning of Harry Truman's presidency to the end of George W. Bush's. He found that an average of 2 million jobs were created per year when a Democrat was president, compared with 1 million annually when a Republican was president. More pointedly, and unfortunately for Romney, business executives have only a mediocre record when transferring their skills to government. In the last great economic mess, this country was led by a Republican who had been stunningly successful in business: Herbert Hoover. Hmm. More recently, President George W. Bush staffed his Cabinet with CEOs who had been stellar in the private sector  and that didn't work out so well, either. Obama's point about our shared undertaking was made last year, more eloquently, by Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for Senate: ""There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own  nobody!"" she said. ""You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear: You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you all were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. ""You built a factory, and it turned into something terrific or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is, you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along."" In short, taxes don't just smother. They can also fuel growth  when they're invested in highways or the Internet, in colleges or early childhood education. They can create opportunities, as they did for Sher Valenzuela. Or for Romney himself. He built his Bain empire partly because he was smart and hard-working, but also because of a great education and because of tax breaks for debt financing. Tax loopholes helped him build his fortune, and other loopholes gave him the low tax rates to retain it. If the Republican convention wishes to highlight and explain Romney's success, it should have a moment of silence to honor our infernal tax code. Who built this country? Entrepreneurs, yes. But so did schoolteachers and railway construction workers. Doctors and truckers. Scientists and soldiers. You didn't build it, Mitt Romney  we all built it."\u000a

Known for his work with New Helvetia Theatre (""They're Playing Our Song"" and ""[title of show]"") and California Musical Theatre (""I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change""), Lee adds a different dimension with this new show.In Everett Quinton's metatheater play-within-a-play telling of the famous Dickens novel, Lee plays an aspiring drag performer who finds a crying infant on his doorstep. In an effort to quiet the child, Lee's character resorts to enacting the Dickens novel and its gallery of larger-than-life characters, including the English lawyer Sydney Carton; French aristocrat Charles Darnay; Miss Lucy Mannette, The Marquis St. Evrmonde; and the infamous Madame Therese Defarge.The Sacramento premiere plays only four nights.

V"True story: In college, I took a class on the 17th century Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and we examined his signature work ""Ethics.""I tried very hard but understood very little, though statements such as ""When the mind imagines its own lack of power, it is saddened by it,"" did speak to me with a certain unintended irony. I also took more accessible (but not particularly less difficult) classes in Shakespeare's tragedies and contemporary British theater.And somehow, all that erudition can now come together for me in the new Big Idea Theatre production with the mouthful of a title, ""New Jerusalem: The Interrogation of Baruch de Spinoza at Talmud Torah Congregation: Amsterdam, July 27, 1656,"" which opens today and runs through Feb. 9. Before you roll your eyes and say, ""Oh, yeah, that sounds like good times,"" understand this is a play, and dramatic license has been taken to make it, you know, entertaining. Playwright David Ives gives us a tried-and-true courtroom drama, as Spinoza is summoned to a synagogue to refute charges of atheism and claims that his writings have threatened the well- being of Amsterdam's small Jewish community.Shannon Mahoney directs ""New Jerusalem,"" which opens Big Idea Theatre's 2013 season. Brian Harrower plays Spinoza; Patrick Murphy plays Saul Levi Morteira, a prominent rabbi; and Blair Leatherwood plays Gaspar Rodrigues ben Israel, a member of the committee judging Spinoza. Performances are at 8 p.m. today, Saturday, Thursday, next Friday and on Jan. 19, 24-26, 31, Feb. 1-2, and 7-9. Tickets are $16 in advance, $20 at the door. All Thursday tickets are $10.

V"BILOXI -- U.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo says he voted against funding to pay the Hurricane Sandy flood insurance claims because of the deficit, but as the chief financial officer for the Biloxi Public Housing Authority back in 2005, Palazzo asked for federal relief despite the nation's debt.The Housing Authority listed $38.5 million in ""Total Funds Needed Right Away"" in a handout published one month after Katrina devastated 70 miles of Mississippi's coastline Aug. 29, 2005.The handout quoted Palazzo, then the authority's deputy director and chief financial officer: ""Tell our national leaders -- don't send more inspectors -- we know what's damaged and how to fix it. Send us money so we can put our families back together and do our part to rebuild our community.""The handout is still posted on its web site.Public housing relief in Mississippi eventually totaled $110 million for Mississippi's three Coastal counties. Harrison County, where Palazzo is from, received $72 million in funding for public housing alone, according to figures compiled in 2010 by the office of former U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, whom Palazzo defeated to take office in 2011 with an anti-Nancy Pelosi message.Congress poured a total of at least $24.6 billion into direct Mississippi Katrina relief, Sun Herald archives show, in large part because of the efforts of Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who then headed the Appropriations Committee, and then-Gov. Haley Barbour, former head of the Republican National Committee.Palazzo has been roundly and widely criticized, here and in the northeast, for joining 66 other House Republicans who voted Friday against adding $9.7 billion to pay National Flood Insurance Program claims. The bill passed the House and Senate, where Mississippi Sens. Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker voted for funding.NFIP funding has been characterized in the media as ""Sandy relief."" However, NFIP sells flood insurance and collects premiums on its policies in exchange for a promise to pay policyholders for flood losses the contract covers.Congress had to bail out NFIP after Katrina's devastating losses, resulting in an $18 billion NFIP debt. NFIP is once again running out of money to cover flood losses.Palazzo told the Sun Herald on Friday evening that he thinks the nation needs to come to grips with how the federal government funds disaster relief, plus find spending cuts to offset the future Sandy relief package. He said he is working on such legislation, but will in the end support Sandy relief.A statement sent to the media Friday evening from Palazzo spokesperson Laura Chambers said: ""Congressman Palazzo fully supports a Sandy relief package that includes spending offsets. On the heels of a fiscal cliff deal that added $4 trillion to our existing $16 trillion national debt, we must ensure that disaster relief is paid for.""He also hopes we will be able to have a much-needed national discussion on disaster relief reform in the coming days.""Reaction was swift and generally negative.A Sunday story from the New York Daily News is headlined: ""Remember the 67 Republicans in House of Representatives who turned their backs on Hurricane Sandy victims.""Mike Lupica, one of the nation's best-known sports writers, singled out Palazzo in the story, writing: ""Perhaps the worst phony of all of them is Rep. Steven Palazzo, out of Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District, which happens to be situated on the Gulf Coast.""Apparently the government was supposed to come rebuild Biloxi and the rest of the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, but is supposed to tell Breezy Point and Staten Island and Jersey to figure it out for themselves.""On the Sun Herald's Saturday story published online, 99 readers commented. Only one of the comments supported Palazzo's decision. The first comment on the story read, in part: ""Now is NOT the time for ""a national discussion about changing the way America funds disasters"". Not when people in my neighborhood are still living in their cars. Not when the local Police Precinct is still closed because the building was damaged . . .""Now is the time for action, not talk. The nerve of this Republican congressman. He didn't want to wait and have a ""national discussion"" when it was his state that got hit by a hurricane, but we are supposed to wait out in the cold. Are you kidding me? No way.""Not when we can spend $1 trillion dollars rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan, but we can't find the money to take care of people in our own country. What is wrong with this guy? What is wrong with anyone who would vote for this guy?The Sun Herald left a message with Palazzo requesting a follow-up interview. Spokesperson Chambers returned the call to find out what the newspaper wanted."\u000a

V"It only seemed as if the ground shook in Carmichael on Saturday when Ponderosa coach Jason Tenner joyfully bearhugged Bruins star Jeff Camilli into the air near midfield after their team's 17-3 Delta River League win at No. 13 Jesuit.The 6-foot-5 Tenner is a former college and professional football lineman who looks as if he can still bull-rush the quarterback. The 6-4, 245-pound Camilli, with his full beard and powerful build, looks as if he's already a college middle linebacker and fullback.The two monsters of muscle and physicality have been through a lot in the past three seasons.There were the back-to-back 2-8 seasons in 2010 and 2011. There was the two-year, 0-10 run in the powerhouse Division I league that includes No. 4 Oak Ridge, No. 5 Folsom and No. 10 Pleasant Grove.So beating  in fact dominating in the second half  a ranked Marauders team (4-2) is a huge statement triumph for the Shingle Springs bunch. They are 5-1 and within one win of reaching the postseason for the first time since 2007.""People haven't been expecting a whole lot out of us, so I challenged this group back in January to commit,"" said Tenner, an all-Atlantic 10 Conference defensive lineman at Villanova who played with the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe. ""It's been a tough battle every year in the DRL, but our kids have never quit. They're fighters. I'm proud of them. I'm a proud father.""Added Camilli: ""I can't even tell you how it feels  I almost teared up before jumping in Tenner's arms. We've been through a lot.""Ponderosa forced four turnovers  interceptions by Alex Roberds and Camilli and fumble recoveries by Christian Canepa and Aaron Jestice  sacked Jesuit quarterback Thomas Sperbeck twice, and never allowed one of the Sac-Joaquin Section's best playmakers to find the end zone.Leading the way was the imposing Camilli, who helped turn a 3-0 Jesuit halftime lead into a 17-3 Ponderosa advantage late in the third quarter.His interception on the second play of the second half set up Curtis Goldsmith's game-tying 36-yard field goal. He then cleared a path to the end zone for Canepa's one-yard touchdown run five minutes later before mowing down several Jesuit defenders en route to a 10-yard touchdown run of his own with 2:17 to go in the same period.Throughout the warm afternoon, Camilli delivered a number of freight-train hits, knocked down several passes and rushed for a deceptively impressive 46 yards on nine carries, some in which several Jesuit tacklers rode him like a bucking bronc.""He's just a man  he's our man, and I love it,"" Tenner said.The hard-hitting ways and impressive physique  and the beard  have earned Camilli the nickname ""The Viking.""But the beard has gotten a lot more slim and trim lately.""It got pretty dirty  my girlfriend didn't like that,"" said a smiling Camilli, who has scholarship offers from Fresno State, Nevada, San Jose State and Colorado State.In Metro Conference games:No. 3 Burbank 67, Florin 12 at Burbank  Junior Calvin Green returned an interception for a touchdown and a punt return for a touchdown and rushed for two touchdowns as the Titans (6-0, 3-0) defeated the Panthers (1-5, 1-2).Sacramento 52, Hiram Johnson 14 in Oak Park  Josiah Johnson completed 17 of 21 passes for 438 yards and six touchdowns as the Dragons (4-2, 2-1) defeated the Warriors (1-5, 0-3)."\u000a

V"STOCKTON  From a 1-5 season start, to a season of promise, to the final day of the Sac-Joaquin Section playoffs, this turnaround baseball season surely will be remembered for years to come at Franklin High School.The Wildcats kept that theme in mind in digesting an otherwise difficult day, falling to state power St. Mary's 8-2 in Game 2 of the Division I best-of-three series Saturday afternoon at Pacific.In taking the series 2-0, the Rams of Stockton celebrated a three-peat, joining Elk Grove (2005-07) as the only Division I teams to accomplish the feat.St. Mary's took down traditional Sacramento-area powers Elk Grove (2010) and Jesuit (2011) for its previous two titles and won its third straight by beating section final newcomer Franklin.Saturday, St. Mary's (27-6) was sharp, and Franklin (22-12) was not. The young Wildcats used three pitchers, made four errors, managed two hits through six innings (four total hits) and were a step slow against a senior-dominated Rams team that played one of the West Coast's most demanding schedules.Gio Brusa, the lone starter on the Rams' three title teams, had two hits and four RBIs.""Great team,"" Franklin first-year coach Bryan Kilby said of the Rams. ""They battled all day and did the little things, and we didn't. We can't hang our heads. We've got a nice group. We battled all year. It wasn't our day.""Four errors is very uncharacteristic for us.  But we had a great season.""Franklin trailed 2-1 through three innings, but St. Mary's scored a run in the fourth and three more in the fifth for a 6-1 lead.Franklin placed third in the Delta Valley Conference behind Davis and Elk Grove, then beat those teams in the D-I North postseason, in addition to eliminating then-Bee No. 1 Pleasant Grove with an 11-5 victory.Of the 25 players in the Franklin dugout Saturday, 20 will return. Those bidding farewell include senior pitchers Josh Pigg, Kyle Von Ruden and Brandon Keup.An example of the Franklin drive and resolve comes from its youngest starter. Hank LoForte, the freshman shortstop and leadoff hitter, spent three early-morning hours at a hospital with a stomach ailment but insisted on playing.LoForte will return with starters Tyler Blake, Kyle Zanzi, Ryan Sarginson, Nick Frei and Connor Adams."\u000a

V"Sometimes an athlete comes your way, Drew Hibbs was explaining Thursday afternoon, and you just know he's special.The boys basketball coach at Foothill High School has mentored dozens of players, some of whom went on to play in college. When he first saw Michael Bryson four years ago, Hibbs knew he had an intriguing young talent loaded with potential.Now a senior, the 6-foot-4 Bryson is a three-year starting guard and one of the best players Hibbs has coached. He's a captain and the focal point of a Mustangs team that has won 23 consecutive games and has visions of winning Foothill's third Northern California Division III championship since 1994.""I could tell with Bryson,"" Hibbs said. ""He was special. Some kids have potential and the tools, but things don't work out for whatever reason. With Michael, we could tell he was going to be different.""Bryson's versatile game, with good grades and character to match, made him a national recruit. He can shoot over defenses from the perimeter or drive the lane and attack the basket. He has above-the-rim abilities, certainly, though there is no showboating in his game. He's averaging 19.3 points.Bryson fielded recruiting interest from Pacific-12 Conference teams and locally from Sacramento State and UC Davis. Last fall, he signed a letter-of-intent with UC Santa Barbara and coach Bob Williams, who coached Hibbs at Menlo College in the Bay Area in the 1980s before coaching at UCD.Still, Bryson said he is not satisfied. He wants to improve  become a better ball handler, develop a quicker release on his shot and play more inspired defense.""You can always get better,"" Bryson said.Bryson gets his basketball genes from his father, James. The elder Bryson played high school ball in Merced and had a stint at Fresno State as a 6-3 small forward. Father and son have waged many front-yard tussles under the family hoop, heaven help the weakening backboard.""My dad's still got it,"" Bryson said with a laugh. ""He still plays in any rec league he can get into. And we still play when we have time. He has his old-man tricks to use on me, and I learned to counter with young-man tricks.""Hibbs said he will forever appreciate coaching Bryson. He is fond of Foothill's core seniors that include David Sanders, Kelly Bender, Dante Hullum and Bryson.""You know how coaches talk about having their best players as their hardest workers?"" Hibbs said. ""That's Michael  and everything falls in line.""Bryson said he is eager to begin college, where he'll study kinesiology but is in no real hurry. There are games to be played and classes to be conquered.""I'm excited about college, but I want to embrace the rest of my senior year first,"" Bryson said.Bryson's teammates embrace the fact that not only is he their best player, he also has the Mustangs' best set of wheels available. Bryson tools to school in his 1995 Dodge Intrepid, not to be confused with a BMW but certainly better than the bus.""All my friends ask for a ride,"" Bryson said.

Last year, they were the last to leave. Motorists will be allowed to exit on J Street as soon as the last race participant crosses the finish line, said Kelly Siefkin, a spokeswoman for Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services, which organizes the event.The food bank suggests that race participants and others park in the neighborhoods to the west of the California State University, Sacramento, campus, roughly bounded by Folsom Boulevard and Elvas Avenue, and M Street and 65th Street. Parking also is available east of the campus, along University Avenue, and participants can get to the start area from there via the Guy West Bridge or the H Street Bridge.Pedestrians should be aware that the corner at J and 58th Streets will be closed to them starting at 8:20 a.m. Spectators and runners can get to the start area via H Street and Carlson Drive or by the Hornet Crossing Tunnel on Elvas Avenue.The 10K race is scheduled to begin at 8:35 a.m. and the 5K race at 9 a.m.Participants and spectators should give themselves plenty of time to reach the race area from the recommended parking areas, because they will need more time to walk to the start line.The north entrance to Sacramento State at J Street and Carlson Drive will be closed to all traffic before and during the race. Drivers can access Sacramento State only by using College Town Drive and State University Drive.Police officers will be directing traffic, as will additional staff hired by the Sacramento Food Bank, including some parking staff from Raley Field.Residents of the area will be allowed to exit their neighborhoods during the race, though they may have to wait for a break among race participants before they can leave the area, Siefkin said.For those who can't make it to east Sacramento on Thanksgiving Day, other communities are hosting fun runs, including:Folsom Turkey TrotWhat: A 5K and 10K run.

I didn't get lots of laughs every night, but you learn by the bad nights.""Gardell, who plays John Ascuaga's Nugget in Sparks on Saturday and Cache Creek in Brooks on Jan. 12, is just dipping into the casino market as he returns to standup while filming the third season of ""Mike & Molly,"" a series he describes as having ""a nice build from the beginning.""""It just gets better every year,"" Gardell said of the CBS sitcom in which he appears opposite Melissa McCarthy, who won an Emmy for the show. ""The rest of the cast makes me look better than I am. Everything looks great for (the show's) renewal.""Now that he's made it in a major sitcom  the dream of many standups  Gardell is giving back. On Jan. 11, Showtime will premiere ""Road Dogs,"" which focuses on comedians Gardell has chosen who ""have been touring a minimum of 15 years, performing every week but you don't see them all the time,"" Gardell said.""It's kind of like what Rodney Dangerfield used to do for comics. I'll start with Kenny Rogerson, Ben Creed and Tim Wilson.""Gardell's standup is noted for its basis in reality, from his rough childhood through a pretty grounded adulthood.""My inspiration was Johnny Carson, and then later Richard Pryor and George Carlin,"" Gardell said. ""I started to like the twist in their comedy. I talk about what I learned when growing up and from being a crazy adolescent.  I was insane, out of my mind.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/16/5194795/roseville-to-host-quidditch-tournament.html,"Some 300 athletes will converge in Roseville this weekend to bring a fictional game to life as they compete in the International Quidditch Association's Western Cup at Maidu Park.Wait. You lost me at ""quidditch."" Isn't that the game in the Harry Potter books and movies that is played on flying brooms? Well, the players use brooms. They just don't fly, unless you call running with a broom between your legs flying.How does a fictional game dreamed up by author J.K. Rowling become a sport? The short answer is that in 2005 some students at Vermont's Middlebury College gathered up some brooms, a slightly deflated volleyball and a dodgeball and had at it.So, other than running around with a broom between their legs, how do they play this game?OK, chasers score points by throwing the volleyball (quaffle) through a hoop, guarded by a keeper. Beaters use the dodgeball (bludger) to knock chasers off their brooms.But what about that flying ball Harry Potter went after?The snitch. Yeah, how do they recreate the snitch? It's a bit of a re-imagining. They put a tennis ball in a sock and stuff it in the back of a runner's shorts and the seekers chase him or her after a head start.Tell me more about quidditch and this weekend's tournament.While the co-ed full-contact sport has grown to more than 800 teams internationally  even as players seek to suppress their friends' snickering  it is not without internal tension.There are some who believe that Harry Potter, Hermione and ""he who must not be named"" should be left on the sideline as the game matures, said Alexis Bristor, the Western regional director of the Quidditch Association. ""We are trying to get this thing taken seriously,"" Bristor said. The sorting hat would have a hard time with Bristor. She's the founder of the hard-hitting Arizona State University team, speaks of her quidditch injuries with a bit of fondness (she took a broom to the nose) and grew up playing sports. But she's a big Harry Potter fan and acknowledges the game's roots. ""We take it very seriously, but at the end of the day we're all friends running around with brooms between our legs,"" she said.Some players are drawn to the sport's eclectic mix of field hockey, dodgeball and full-contact hide-and-seek, while others are drawn to playing out a childhood fantasy, Bristor said. ""For the most part, the hard-core Harry Potter nerds are not the best quidditch players,"" said Bristor, who is organizing the weekend tournament.One of those Harry Potter nerds is Becky Wangberg, who attended American River College before transferring to Chapman College in Orange County.""I got involved because I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and I always thought quidditch was the coolest thing,"" Wangberg said via email before beginning the drive up from West Hollywood, where she's co-captain of the Hollywood Harpies.While she says there are people on her team who never read the books or watched the movies (gasp), she said separating the game from the boy wizard would be a shame.""If it wasn't for Harry Potter  quidditch wouldn't exist,"" Wangberg said. ""Not that I think everyone who plays quidditch has to be a complete Harry Potter nerd,"" she added.By some accounts the brooms are what set the sport apart. ""Without the broom you are just playing your average sport,"" Bristor said. ""With the broom, you are doing everything one-handed."" But even the role of the nonflying broom is being challenged. Players must hold a broom between their legs while in the field of play. And in competition both teams must use the same model, to keep one team from gaining an an unfair advantage by using a lighter or shorter broom.Wangberg said she is ""slightly OK"" with using simulated brooms made from PVC pipes, but would hate to see the brooms disappear.""If the sport continues to pull away from (Harry Potter) then I imagine the brooms will go as well  when the broom is the best part!"" she said. ""It's what makes the sport 'magical.' ""So why Roseville? Do we have local teams? The event, starting at 10 a.m. today, will include 17 teams from as far as British Columbia, but there are no local teams.

V"For years, there was only the Amazing Kreskin. In a casino-entertainment world full of magicians, crooners and topless dancers, psychics were rarely embraced as performers likely to pull in the gambling crowd. Kreskin blazed the way and casinos opened up to a wider range of attractions. It's been shown that a good psychic or mentalist can draw as well as any comedian, and at this point there is nobody who draws as well as Sylvia Browne, making two appearances at Thunder Valley, on Thursday, Jan. 17, and Friday, Jan. 18. Browne does not spend her time saying she can find hidden money. She does not pick up on thoughts sent from the audience. She sits calmly on stage and talks about what she sees happening and about to happen in the world. Her topics can range from dietary advice to Mideast policy. Then she spends time with individual members of the audience who line up to ask her personal questions. Her responses are brief and to the point. Whatever Browne is, there is no doubt she is bold. She is unafraid to tell people they will suffer or even die with an illness, she is not reluctant to tell people to leave their spouses, and all her pronouncements are given with utmost conviction. Her following is huge. Her website offers private sessions, a newsletter, and 45 books. She is an industry.

V"Whatever her problems were, whatever it was that led Sharion Renay King to hook up with the pimp who murdered her, when it came to the home front, she had always been the family rock.Always employed, mostly in banks, King stood strong for her mother and father. They've gotten old, and her dad is blind and in a wheelchair. They had planned these late stages of their lives around her caregiving. But she's gone now, and Clifford Hudson and Shirley Shanklin don't really know what to do.""I'm just lost,"" Hudson said, behind his sunglasses, sitting in his wheelchair in a courtroom hallway, after the man who murdered his 43-year-old daughter had just been sentenced to prison for 57 years to life. The killer, Robert Albert Thompson, 37, called himself ""The Boogie Man."" He lured women he met on a social networking website and put some of them to work selling sex on the street.Not King.She battled the bottle and dabbled in dope, but she was a working woman, with real jobs in the financial services industry, and no known criminal record, officials said. She was not a prostitute like some of the other women who hooked up with Thompson.Still, he manipulated her emotions, her life, to get at her hard-earned money.Prosecutors said when King challenged the control Thompson exercised over their relationship, he stabbed her to death Feb. 14, 2012, in Discovery Park and set her body on fire.What's left is a 70-year-old blind man in a wheelchair who, whenever he got sad and blue, called his daughter on the telephone just to have her come over to his house and take him for a spin in the car, to get him some fresh air.""I can't do nothing now,"" Clifford Hudson said. ""I could always depend on her. If I was feeling bad, I could call her and she'd come over and she could tell the way I felt. She'd come see about me and take me out.""Hudson said his current wife, Ruby, suffered an aneurysm. He said it was Sharion who stepped up to keep the house running, to take care of Ruby, to nurse her back into better health.""She had to teach my wife how to walk and talk all over again,"" Hudson said. Sharion's mother, Shirley Shanklin, is getting close to retirement age. Shanklin lives in Fresno. She'd been planning on moving to Sacramento and living with her late daughter.""I was going to make her life better, and she was going to help me out,"" Shanklin said. ""I can't believe this is real. I miss my baby. I cry every day. It's been every day. It won't go away.""Judge Russell L. Hom told the family there was nothing in the sentence he was about to deliver to Thompson that would relieve their loss.But he gave the family what they wanted, which was as much prison time for Robert Thompson as possible, and then some.Thompson's probation report recommended a 52-to-life term. But the judge dug around in the killer's long list of convictions for prior offenses that ranged from drugs to robbery to jail sodomy to find a bonus five-year enhancement to tack onto Thompson's term.""This is truly a senseless death,"" Hom told Thompson. ""I could not understand what the motivation for this was, why this happened. This is truly a situation where you slaughtered somebody that is innocent, and the manner that you committed this murder showed nothing but callousness, not only for the person who was your victim, but also to those you have left as victims, in terms of family."""\u000a

V"A recent trend in improved water clarity at Lake Tahoe has scientists and regional agency planners confident that 15 years of environmental measures are beginning to bear fruit.Last year's annual average clarity depth at the lake was recorded at 75.3 feet  more than an 11-foot improvement from the all-time worst recorded in 1997, according to data from the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center.A series of measurements  recording the depth at which a 10-inch white disk can be seen  is taken between December and March to establish a winter figure, and another series between June and September to get a summer figure. All of the readings are averaged to determine the annual figure for lake clarity.Clarity readings for summers typically are lower than for winter, and in recent years have been much lower. The three shallowest depth recordings taken since 1968, when record-keeping began, have been summer readings in the last five years. In 2012, however, the lake's summer average clarity level was 64.5 feet, a marked improvement from 2008 when an all-time low was recorded  at 50.4 feet.Clarity depth is considered a key barometer in establishing the level of pollutants at the lake, most of which enter the lake from stormwater runoff, including flows from streets, farms and other development. Data from clarity measurements is an important tool for agencies in crafting land-use management and ecosystem restoration efforts in the Lake Tahoe basin.Despite the generally poor numbers in the summer, the view is that clarity at the lake is headed in the right direction, said Kristi Boosman, spokeswoman for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.""One of our big goals has been to try and stabilize the declines,"" Boosman said. ""Stabilizing an ecosystem that has been under as much stress as the Lake Tahoe basin really takes some time. We're starting to see the implications of that now.""She said 75 percent of marshes around the lake have been affected by human development.Boosman contends that the deeper clarity levels seen in 2012 may be the latest outgrowth of a 1997 Environment Improvement Program at the lake. That program cost $1.6 billion and became a multiagency, multistate and stakeholder effort. That program has put into place erosion control for more than 577 miles of roads and restored 151,000 acres of wildlife habitat in the Lake Tahoe basin, she said.Boosman said if clarity numbers are to continue improving, old construction at the lake will have to adopt better stormwater runoff practices.""Seventy-two percent of the particulate matter that goes into the lake comes from old buildings and old infrastructure,"" Boosman said. Those buildings and constructed areas date mostly back to the boom at the lake that followed the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, she said. ""We're living with the impacts of that old legacy development."" Boosman said recent construction at the lake is required to meet certain standards in the handling of stormwater runoff.Boosman said such practices will allow the agency to meet clarity depth goals. The eventual goal is to achieve an annual average clarity depth of 97.4 feet by 2076.But big challenges remain. It has not been established how the problem of diminished clarity during the summer months will be approached. The culprit in the those numbers is spring runoff from snowmelt, said John Reuter, research ecologist with the UC Davis Tahoe Environment Research Center.Despite the low clarity numbers seen during the summer months recently, the level improved in 2012  with a depth increase of 13 feet. ""But, we're hesitant to make any conclusions based on any one year,"" Reuter said. Even so, last year's improved clarity may signal there is hope that Lake Tahoe's deep blue waters will someday return to the 102- foot level recorded in 1968.""The whole point of all the restoration going on at the lake is to make adjustments to the landscape, with revegetation to mimic what the natural environment would have done before there were roads and homes there,"" Reuter said. But restoration and stormwater runoff efforts will have to accommodate the latter-day effects of climate change, he said. Climate change models suggest higher winter temperatures will visit Lake Tahoe and cause decreased snowpack levels  and frequent intense rain events. Some drainage systems may not be able to accommodate the faster and stronger runoff.In a 2008 UC Davis study on how climate change may affect the Tahoe basin, it was predicted that decreased snowpack and rainy winters will have a marked effect on lake clarity and water quality.Some, like hydrologist Robert Shibatani, say the effects will be dramatic.""No other area in California will experience the kinds of observable hydroclimatic effects associated with climate change as the Sierra Nevada,"" Shibatani said.In a 2012 report, Shibatani contended that, by 2020, Sierra snowpack levels could average as much as 50 percent less than they do today."\u000a

V"A crowd of 30 low- income and homeless residents and advocates told Sacramento County supervisors Tuesday not to water down an affordable housing ordinance.A county committee has recommended that the county change its 2004 ordinance to require new development to have 8 percent affordable housing instead of 15 percent. The committee is responding to the decline of the housing construction market, which also led the city of Folsom last year to drop its affordable housing requirement.The county has hired a consultant to study the issue before bringing a proposal to the supervisors.In the meantime, county staff members want the board to remove references to the law from a state planning document called a ""housing element."" The county must submit its housing plan to the California Department of Housing and Community Development this year.Including the ordinance in the plan would lock the county into the policy for eight years, the length of time the housing plan lasts, said Planning Director Leighann Moffitt.Supervisors directed staff to come back to the board next month with proposals for how the affordable housing ordinance might be addressed in the housing plan.Not including the ordinance in the plan would weaken the county's commitment to affordable housing, said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Housing Alliance.""The community needs to be sure you're not going to dismantle this landmark ordinance,"" he said.While the recession has hurt developers, it has also hurt the poor, making it harder for them to get housing, he said.The Housing Alliance successfully challenged Folsom's abandonment of its ordinance in court, saying the decision was at odds with its housing element. A judge agreed with that argument.The city has appealed the decision, and is now proposing that the requirement be lowered from 15 to 10 percent.Some county supervisors argued Tuesday that the ordinance has not been successful, and now is the time to let the market generate affordable housing.""What we have seen in the last several years is that market forces override anything we can do,"" Supervisor Roberta MacGlashan said.John Costa of the North State Building Industry Association said the county needs to cut back on regulations.""The housing market is starting to recover,"" he said. ""But we have a long way to go.""Right now, the county's affordable housing ordinance breaks down the requirements for low income, very low income and extremely low income. The proposed change would eliminate the extremely low income category and require 4 percent of housing for low income and 4 percent for very low income."\u000a

V"Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation Tuesday that charges consumers a 1 percent tax on lumber products starting in January and restricts damages landowners pay for sparking wildfires.The timber industry backed Assembly Bill 1492 for several reasons: Consumers will pay for regulatory costs that landowners previously paid; the liability provisions could restrict payouts in future federal lawsuits; harvest plans remain effective for longer periods, resulting in less frequent environmental reviews; and the tax applies to purchases of imported lumber that comprises the majority of wood sold, in addition to in-state products.""California's laws have saddled our timber industry with costly burdens while giving out-of-state competitors a free ride  but that stops today,"" Brown said in a statement. ""This legislation enacts serious bipartisan reform to even the playing field to protect California's timber-industry jobs.""The California Forestry Association argued that small timber companies were at risk of going under because they faced high regulatory costs and could not get sufficient insurance in light of record-high wildfire lawsuit awards.Some environmentalists supported the bill because it generates $30 million for timber regulatory activities, especially at the Department of Fish and Game, whose budget has faced cuts in recent years. They said it would enable the state to conduct more thorough reviews of tree-cutting plans.But other environmentalists had concerns about loosening time restrictions on timber harvest reviews, as well as narrowing liability provisions.Lumber retailers Home Depot and Lowe's were opposed, as were dealers that sell wood to home builders. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association also opposed the bill.The signing came one day before a meeting of the Board of Forestry and Fire Prevention, which is expected to decide today which wood products will be taxed. A draft regulation says that solid wood products such as lumber, fence boards and wooden roof shakes would be charged. So would ""engineered"" and ""composite"" wood products such as particle board.Exempt would be furniture, paper products, indoor flooring, firewood, cabinets and sporting goods, among other finished items.The new charge will relieve the state general fund from spending tens of millions of dollars  money now potentially free for use on education and social service programs unrelated to lumber.The bill died near the close of the legislative session, only to be revived in the final minutes with the bare minimum of votes to reach Brown's desk. The proposal was a major win for the timber industry, which employed some of Sacramento's most powerful lobbyists in the final month of session."\u000a

V"The heartbreaking beauty of Stephen Sondheim's moving ""Merrily We Roll Along"" inevitably comes in its final moments. Director Connor Mickiewicz's lively musical spills over with wrenching irony (not nearly the same as being ironic), stemming from its reverse chronology, and as we see the central characters youthfully perched on the verge of their lives, we can't help but reflect on the future we've already seen awaiting them. In New Helvetia Theatre's ambitious new production, with an animated cast led by the sparkling Matthew Schneider as Franklin Shepard, gallop through Sondheim's wonderfully varied score. Jouni Kirjola quietly makes his own splash as he effectively matches Schneider's aggressive Franklin with a moody, shaded Charley Kringas. Charley holds forth as the honest, sensitive playwright and lyricist who hooks up with Franklin's brass-ring-grabbing composer and continually tries keeping the artistic partnership on track. Lauren Parker's caustic Mary Flynn completes the show's lead trio, adding a vibrant vocal quality to the show.""Merrily"" has always had a troubled production history, including lasting only 16 performances in its 1981 Broadway debut. Sondheim's terrific music and songs were never considered the problem. (A first-rate stage band, led by Chris Schlagel, supports the vocalists here.)The oversimplified story takes the blame as George Furth's book, based on a play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, suggests that money and success are the root of all evil. Franklin continually sells himself and Charley out for one more big payday. The promised return to the meaningful music they once passionately believed in never happens.Solid contributions come from Courtney Glass and Tristan Rumery as a brassy manipulative actress and her blithely supportive producer husband. Kiera Anderson also makes a game stand as Franklin's long-suffering wife, Beth.Naturally, the seldom-seen and seldom-heard (at least around these parts) Sondheim gems such as the complexly layered ""Old Friends"" make this production worth seeing and hearing. Kirjola nearly comically implodes with anger in ""Franklin Shepard, Inc.,"" and Anderson beautifully lands the ballad ""Not a Day Goes By.""Because this cautionary tale of the compromises we make in life starts at its bitter ending and rewinds to the hopeful beginning, the intended effect is a bittersweet chill. Because we end at the beginning there's a sense that perhaps it doesn't have to be that way, which gives this strongly performed production a rarely felt tension at its end. MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG3 1/2 starsWhat: The New Helvetia Theatre presents Stephen Sondheim's ""Merrily We Roll Along.""

V"The unpredictable high school football season continues with twists, turns and upsets.A closer look at Week 4:Tigers' tale  Inderkum beating previous Bee No. 3 Pleasant Grove 42-28 didn't qualify as the biggest upset in the Sac-Joaquin Section, but there isn't a Tigers player or coach who will argue that it was the greatest win in the program's history.Most surprising was that Inderkum led 34-6 at halftime. The Tigers, who rose four spots to No. 9, pounced on four botched kickoffs to seize early control.Inderkum has been a section Division III power under coach Terry Stark, who has tried to schedule a top Division I program and got one with Pleasant Grove. C.J Spencer passed for 205 yards and accounted for two scores, and Kevin Blueford had 17 tackles for the Tigers.Titans towering  Burbank coach John Heffernan scheduled tough opponents this season in an effort to prepare for the long run  a first-time visit to the section D-I final. The No. 5 Titans downed Del Oro 28-23 with long touchdown runs by Ondrai White, Isaiah Williams and Calvin Green a week after inflicting similar damage to Grant.Grizzlies growl  After falling to Southern California powers Westlake and Oaks Christian to open the season, No. 4 Granite Bay unleashed pent-up frustration against Vacaville, which came in ranked No. 3 in Northern California by MaxPreps.Granite Bay led 40-6 at halftime and prevailed 47-21 behind two rushing touchdowns by John Cooley and one by Tony Ellison. The series between these rivals stands at 4-4-1.Trojans test  Sixth-ranked Oak Ridge belted previous No. 11 Grant 42-14 behind Jason Samuels' three touchdown passes and a defense that pitched a second-half shutout. Grant has it no easier this week with No. 16 Del Oro coming to Del Paso Heights on Friday, with both teams desperate for a win.Franklin fury  Second-ranked Franklin stretched a 9-3 halftime lead into a 23-3 victory over Cosumnes Oaks in front of a packed Elk Grove stadium that the programs share. Marcus Green had three interceptions for Franklin, and Christian Fonbuena rushed for two touchdowns.Placer power  Seventh-ranked Placer led Casa Roble 43-0 early in the third quarter with defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes recording 3 1/2 sacks and won 63-21. This comes three weeks after the Hillmen defeated Modesto's Central Catholic 48-30.Central recently edged St. Mary's of Stockton 28-21, and St. Mary's fell to national powerhouse De La Salle of Concord 21-13 Friday. De La Salle is 224-0-2 against Northern California teams since 1991.Top games this week  Third-ranked Nevada Union visits No. 1 Elk Grove on Friday in a meeting of longtime rivals who live by the wing-T. Vacaville hosts Oak Ridge on Friday in a homecoming of sorts for Trojans coach Eric Cavaliere. He played at Vacaville in the 1980s and got into coaching because of Tom Zunino, the late Vacaville coach. Franklin hosts No. 13 Jesuit at Cosumnes Oaks on Friday, pitting its fast defense against Marauders quarterback Thomas Sperbeck.Browning watch  Folsom sophomore quarterback Jake Browning has opened the season with touchown passing efforts (in order) of 10, four, two and one. Has his arm fallen off? No, the unbeaten and No. 8 Bulldogs also have a running game.  THE BEE'S TOP 20PR  previous rankingSchool W-L PR1. Elk Grove 4-0 12. Franklin 4-0 23. Nevada Union 3-1 44.

V"Around the region in three minutes or less  Holy moly  Thomas Sperbeck delivered one of the greatest Holy Bowl efforts in the game's 42-year history, and he's still trying to catch his breath.Saturday night, the Jesuit High School senior quarterback accounted for all of the Marauders' touchdowns in a 28-23 victory over Christian Brothers at Hughes Stadium, where there was a sea of Jesuit white and red on one side and CBS blue on the other.Sperbeck threw a 28-yard touchdown laser, slithered in for a four-yard score, raced 72 yards untouched for another and capped the evening by returning a fumble 85 yards for a touchdown. In last year's Holy Bowl, Sperbeck managed just one down of action because of illness.Said first-year Jesuit coach Marlon Blanton: ""Thank God for Sperbeck. He put us on his back.""McKay's journey  Andy McKay has stepped down as the baseball coach at Sacramento City College to become the mental skills director for the Colorado Rockies organization. The Rockies' catching coach is Jerry Weinstein, McKay's mentor when he played for him at SCC in the 1980s.Derek Sullivan takes over at Sac City, which has suffered just two losing seasons since 1970.Jordan patrol  Jordan Richards dreamed of nights like this: making plays against top teams and winning. The Stanford sophomore safety from Folsom had an interception and helped key a spirited defensive effort that knocked off then-No. 2 USC 21-14.Big Nifae  If USC-bound Eddie Vanderdoes of Placer High is this season's top nationally recruit lineman with personality, he has company.Say hello to Nifae Lealao, a 6-foot-5, 275-pound junior defensive lineman for Capital Christian who stands as a true big man on a small-school campus. As silly as he can be dominant, Lealao on Sunday received a scholarship offer from UCLA assistant coach Angus McClure, a former Sacramento State lineman and coach.Miller-Wing's ease  Taylor Miller-Wing lost a close competition to be the starting quarterback at Folsom this fall.Deflated and suddenly without interest in the sport, the senior turned in his gear and wished sophomore starter Jake Browning well.Said Miller-Wing on Saturday while watching the Holy Bowl, ""I'm really at peace with this and ready to finish school and go into the Navy. You can't play football if you're not into it. I'm just sorry so many people who don't even know me attacked my character on (social media).""Shaq attack  In Washington's 52-13 rout of Portland State, coached by former Jesuit and Huskies star Nigel Burton, Shaq Thompson of Grant blocked a field-goal attempt Tre Watson returned 79 yards for a Huskies touchdown.Rios rumblings  Defensive back Marcus Rios from Cosumnes Oaks is no longer a redshirt freshman at UCLA. He is now a freshman, having his redshirt status peeled away after playing extensively in the Bruins' 37-6 win over Houston."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/26/4940064/prep-football-notes-oak-ridge.html,"Resilience has been a theme for two teams that face off tonight with Delta River League championship hopes, not to mention Sac-Joaquin Section Division I playoff positioning.Seventh-ranked Oak Ridge plays No. 8 Pleasant Grove at Sheldon, with each coach wondering if the opponent has a weakness.Pleasant Grove has won four consecutive games. It lost to Lincoln of Stockton, then ranked third in the section, 34-27 in Week 1 and responded with a 29-28 come-from-behind effort over then-No. 2 Nevada Union.Then there was the 42-28 loss at ranked Inderkum, a game in which the Tigers led 34-6 at halftime.Oak Ridge (7-1) has won two straight since losing to No. 2 Folsom 49-21. Sometimes, Trojans coach Eric Cavaliere said, a punch in the face mask does a program good.""Our team has responded exactly as expected after the Folsom loss,"" Cavaliere said. ""I'm quite pleased with their attitude. No finger pointing or feeling sorry for themselves, just anxious to get back on the field.""The same theme is playing out at Pleasant Grove.The Eagles (6-2) seek to win or share their fifth league title since 2007 and fourth trip to the section D-I title in the same span.From injuries to losses, Pleasant Grove has no quit in it.""We have a great group with a lot of resolve,"" Pleasant Grove coach Joe Cattolico said. ""Things have come less easily than they did the past few years, and it says a lot about this group to persevere and battle.""Pleasant Grove has admirably filled a lot of vacancies in the lineup, from nationally recruited lineman Arik Armstead (now at Oregon) to quarterback Cody Demps (now playing basketball at Sacramento State).No one lineman could replace Armstead, an All-American, but by committee, the Eagles are formidable in the trenches again. New quarterback Dre Terrell has flourished. The junior has 14 touchdown passes and just one interception. He can run and make plays in the secondary and on special teams as one of the section's most dynamic talents.Terrell has a standout wide receiver in Wyatt Demps, the kid brother of Cody, and a 1,000-yard rusher in Isaiah Saunders, the kid brother of Jalen Saunders, a wide receiver at Oklahoma.Oak Ridge is led by senior quarterback Jason Samuels, veteran lines and a tough defense that includes standout defensive end Zack Claiborne and unsung linebacker Nick Gordon, ""who continues to lead our team week in and week out,"" Cavaliere said.Cole Miner?  The status of Nevada Union senior Cole Hannum could be decided today. The linebacker-fullback transferred from Marysville over the summer. He was deemed ineligible by the Sac-Joaquin Section, which ruled that Hannum had prior contact with the Nevada Union coaching staff through a team camp and followed a coach to the program from Marysville.NU has appealed the decision. Athletic director Steve Pilcher said a CIF committee had 15 days to respond to the appeal, the last day being today.Blue crew  Dan Carmazzi said he's delighted to be back at Christian Brothers for the first time since the 1970s, when he got his start at his alma mater as an assistant coach. After a 31-year run as Jesuit's head football coach, Carmazzi is back at CBS as an assistant to George Petrissans. Carmazzi is a popular figure on campus. Students are known to chant his name during volleyball games.""Everyone here has been very welcoming,"" Carmazzi said. ""George is a great guy who has been very supportive in putting up with me. People even say I look good in blue.""CBS is 4-4 after losses to ranked Rio Linda (33-27) and Del Campo (41-38) and likely must beat Bella Vista and Casa Roble in the coming weeks to secure a playoff berth. CBS was 1-9 last season."\u000a

V"Dominic Granieri's 17-yard field goal with 7.8 seconds to play lifted No. 5 Placer to a 10-7 win over upset-minded Lincoln on Friday night in their Pioneer Valley League battle in Lincoln.After Todd Valiere knocked down a long Lincoln pass near the goal line, the Hillmen went 71 yards to the Lincoln 1-foot line before Granieri made his kick.The biggest play of the decisive drive was Peter Denham's 34-yard pass to Valiere.Placer (8-0, 3-0), Cal-Hi Sports' No. 1-ranked Northern California Division II state bowl team, took a 7-0 lead on Cameron Scott's two-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. But the Fighting Zebras (4-4, 1-2) tied the game on James Hubbard's two-yard run with 10 minutes to play in the fourth quarter.No. 3 Folsom 49, Sheldon 13 in Folsom  Jake Browning threw five touchdown passes, including three to Trace Noble, and Bailey Laolagi and Harry Lipnosky each rushed for touchdowns as the Bulldogs (8-0, 3-0) defeated the Huskies (3-5, 0-3) in a Delta River League game.No. 4 Burbank 65, Rosemont 12 at Burbank  Ernest Jenkins rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns; Keith Marcus for 125 yards and a touchdown and Isaiah Williams 115 yards and three touchdowns; and Taniela Finau and Jarad Hill returned interceptions for touchdowns as the Titans (8-0, 5-0) coasted to the Metro Conference win over the Wolverines (4-4, 3-2).No. 6 Granite Bay 21, No. 10 Del Oro 7 in Granite Bay  Grant Caraway threw two touchdown passes and ran 50 yards for a score to lead the Grizzlies (5-3, 3-0) over the Golden Eagles (3-5, 2-1) in the battle for first place in the Sierra Foothill League.No. 7 Oak Ridge 20, Ponderosa 17 in El Dorado Hills  The Trojans (7-1, 2-1), trailing 17-7 in the fourth quarter, rallied to beat the Bruins (5-3, 1-2) on a five-yard scoring strike from Jason Samuels to Ross Dwelley and a 73-yard touchdown run by Blake Martin in the Delta River League game.Martin's go-ahead score, his second touchdown of the game, came with four minutes to play.No. 8 Pleasant Grove 38, Jesuit 21 at Sheldon  Deaundre Terrell passed for 149 yards and two touchdowns, rushed for 79 yards and two scores and had an interception, and Isaiah Saunders rushed for 187 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Eagles (6-2, 3-0) past the Marauders (4-4, 0-3) in the Delta River League contest.

V"The rosy scene bothered Tampa attorney Steve Yerrid.There was Gov. Rick Scott on Monday, happily announcing a $30 million marketing and tourism grant from BP for seven Panhandle counties, thanking a BP senior executive at his side for ""stepping up.""Yerrid, appointed by then-Gov. Charlie Crist last year to serve as Floridas special counsel on the oil spill, says the grant is chump change compared to at least $1 billion the state could get from filing a claim against the oil giant.The fact that we havent filed a claim, and [Scotts] been in office since January, to me cannot be adequately explained, Yerrid said. Its not like Florida doesnt need the money.Scott has said he does not want to resort to a lawsuit, though his office said Monday it was working on a possible strategy for a state claim  a precursor to filing suit.""My goal is to try to work with BP and make sure we dont end up in litigation,"" Scott told reporters.Scotts reluctance irks a cast of Floridians who want the state to receive the same legal consideration as Louisiana and Alabama, which have already joined a federal case that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. Time is running out, they say.U.S. Rep.

V"Just as they were encouraged to boo Captain Hook last year every time he stepped onto the Eldorado stage in ""Peter Pan,"" kids are being coached to do so with Abanazar Jafar, villain in the current holiday production of ""Aladdin.""They do so with extreme enthusiasm because this show, even more than ""Peter Pan,"" is full of audience participation and appeals strongly to an age group that couldn't give a hoot about such things as coherent plots. There is a hero who is young and handsome, a villain who is older and mustached, and silliness galore.Who could ask for anything more?Oh, yes, there is more  3-D. Audience members are given polarized glasses when they enter and are told when to put them on during the show. At that point, the center of the stage becomes much like a multidimensional movie screen, with all sorts of things popping out of it: scary critters such as spiders and bats, along with rocks, jewels and, of course, a genie.It all works surprisingly well. It lacks the clarity of today's movie technology, but when a button appears in front of your face with urgent appeals from the actors on the stage not to push it, the illusion is sharp enough to make even grownups want to reach into thin air and check it out.The story of Aladdin is part of the public domain and therefore open to any mischief. This show, directed by Quintin Young, does not even pretend to follow either the original story or the Disney version. Narrated by Ali Baba (the very talented Christopher Wren), and starring the amiable Cameron Smith as Aladdin, Marissa Joy as Princess Jasmine, Roy Richardson as Jafar (who is also a magician) and the charming Jessica Mann as Yu Yin, the story works its way toward the climax with abundant social and cultural references, very few of which have anything to do with the Middle East.Gags and tricks abound. Princess Jasmine appears out of a magic box (""of Pandora""), and Ali Baba is tortured inside the classic Zig-Zag box  his lower half is separated from his upper. There are three martial-artist characters who perform a leaping, sword-flashing dance and battle to the finish with Aladdin and Ali Baba.The children of the cast perform a techno-robotic- acrobatic number. The music ranges from ""I'm A Believer"" to, believe it or not, ""Thriller.""The story and action in ""Aladdin"" are clearly directed toward children, and the show is best enjoyed in their company. There is only one disturbing moment, and it has nothing to do with wicked critters or evil sorcerers. When a child is selected from the audience and given a fabric club with which to subdue the villain, please do not have him take a couple of practice swings at his mother.

V"A Galt animal shelter that is struggling to stay afloat may close soon if it does not secure new funding.""The economy really killed us,"" said R.J. Verni, founder and executive director of the Elk Grove-based Animal Rescue League, which operates the shelter in Galt.Verni said the organization has fallen behind on its rent payments for 17 months and is expecting eviction ""at any moment.""The 7-year-old shelter relies largely on public donations and private grants. Those all dried up in 2009 as the economic downturn continued.The organization spends about $3,000 a month  including a $900 rent payment  taking care of the animals.The group's landlord, Gyan Kalwani of Sheldon Business Park, said Animal Rescue League owes about $30,000 in back rent, which comes to about 33 months. He said he has tried working with the group and lowered the rent payment from $1,200 to $900.Kalwani said he would move to evict the shelter if it does not come up with a $5,000 payment in 30 to 60 days. The nonprofit is a ""no-kill shelter,"" which means it does not euthanize its animals. This has been problematic, because donations have slowed and adoptions are down. As a result, the number of animals the shelter has to care for has grown. Today, the shelter houses about 60 cats and a couple of dogs. Another 40 animals live in temporary foster homes.""We got two to three adoptions a week when the economy was good,"" Verni said. ""Now, it's one a month if we're lucky.""Meanwhile, the service calls haven't stopped. Verni said she gets more than 50 calls a day from people reporting abandoned animals, but she hasn't been able to take them in.""Our phones are ringing off the hooks,"" Verni said. ""We fulfill a niche.""Verni founded the shelter when she noticed a kitten that was abandoned in a Dumpster. While dogs and cats are welcome, Verni has concentrated her efforts on feral cats. The group is seeking donations from the public, so it can continue to operate. Verni said the shelter goes through a 15-pound bag of food each day. ""Any day now, the owner may be coming to evict us. We just need help.""To donate or volunteer, visit: www.savethecathouse.org"\u000a

V"They came in droves. For eight hours Saturday, Girl Scouts, troop leaders and their families flocked to a West Sacramento warehouse to pick up their orders of Girl Scout cookies. Two assembly lines staffed by 400 volunteers awaited them, distributing more than 800,000 boxes of the famed goodies.""By the time we're done, we'll have sold 2.8 million boxes,"" said Diane Bosley, director of product sales for Girl Scouts Heart of Central California, which covers 18 counties throughout the Central Valley, including Sacramento.Girl Scout cookies are sold only from January through March, and help fund local troop activities. The baked delights have garnered a huge national following. Bosley noted that last year Thin Mints surpassed Oreos as America's No. 1-selling cookie. On Saturday, around 973 troops showed up from across the region in 2,000 vehicles. Some arrived in SUVs. Others had trailers hitched to the back of pickup trucks. But there was no shortage of cookies to hand out. ""It's just the best experience ever,"" said Diana Ramirez, 15, who was loading the cookies. ""You get in a groove.""Ramirez is not new to the annual cookie sales. The Folsom High student started in Girl Scouts as a fourth-grader. She said the challenge in selling cookies, for her at least, is competing with the younger Scouts. ""Everyone likes to buy them from the little kids,"" Ramirez said. ""So we try being fun and exciting  making up cheers.""A typical Girl Scout sells around 159 boxes of cookies, according to Bosley. At $4 a box, that's more than $600 in sales per person. The cookies will be available door-to-door and at special sites like grocery stores, until sales end March 17.The Girl Scout cookie empire has sales of some $790 million annually  an indication of the cookies' popularity, since they are sold only in a three-month period. Melanie Glover, spokeswoman for Girl Scouts Heart of Central California, said there's a reason the cookies are not sold over the Internet.""We're trying to teach the skills of goal-setting, money management, decision-making, business ethics and people skills,"" she said. ""You can only learn those skills in person."""\u000a

V"""Severed Roots,"" a historical drama by Manuel Jose Pickett and Sam Rios, deals with the first contacts between Mayans and Spanish explorers on the Yucatn Peninsula.In 1511, Spaniard Gonzalo Guerrero, shipwrecked sailor, soldier and adventurer, and Geronimo de Aguilar, a young priest, were captured by a Mayan tribe but escaped, only to become slaves of another tribe.Guerrero taught what he knew to his captors, becoming a chief and marrying the wealthy princess Zazil Ha. Their children were the first mestizos, or Mexicans.Aguilar, who had become fluent in Mayan, eventually joined with Spanish conquistador Hernn Corts and served as a translator during the 1519 Spanish conquest of Mexico.Guerrero's legacy has had twists and turns, but he now is celebrated for embracing the Mayan culture and contributing to its preservation. Performances of the Teatro Espejo production continue at 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturdays and 2 p.m. Sundays through Sept. 9. At California Stage, 25th and R streets. Tickets are $20 and $15.

V"When he was 7, Nicholas Fiegener wanted a puppy.So his dad, Alan, made Nicholas and older brother Ross a deal. Attend all wrestling practices and two tournaments that year and the dog was theirs.The boys did what they were told, and their dad made good on his promise.""I ended up going to all of the tournaments, got a puppy and love the sport,"" Fiegener said.Said Dad: ""They really wanted a puppy, so I finally gave in.""It's a decade later, and Folsom High School wrestling coach Mike Collier said he has thanked Alan Fiegener for making sure the boys stayed on track to get Chico, their golden retriever.""We've had that discussion a few times,"" Collier said. ""I said to him, 'That is probably one of the best talks you ever had with your son.' ""Fiegener, a junior who is ranked second in the state at 160 pounds, will compete starting Friday in the two-day CIF State Boys Wrestling Championships in Bakersfield for a shot at his - and Folsom's - first state title.""That would be super cool,"" Fiegener said. ""I think the school would go crazy and my parents would go crazy.""Fiegener, 54-2 this season, won his third Delta River League title and his second Sac-Joaquin Section Division-IA title. He won his first Masters title last Saturday in Stockton, where he beat Ray Lomas of Central Catholic. Lomas was ranked No. 18 in the nation at 170 pounds before dropping a weight class in January.""That was great. I knew it would be tough, but I knew I could beat him,"" Fiegener said. ""It was nice to beat him. Not only for sections, but for state I have a better draw.""One of Fiegener's losses this season was against an opponent he might wrestle again if he reaches Saturday's final.Fiegener lost to Isaiah Martinez of Lemoore by a 16-1 technical fall at the Doc Buchanan Invitational in Clovis in January. Martinez is ranked No. 1 in the state and No. 2 in the nation at 160 pounds.Fiegener admitted he was taken aback going against the top wrestler in the state.""The whole energy of the room was a little overwhelming,"" Fiegener said. ""That will be instrumental for me to be able to adjust and wrestle him better this time. I know what I have to do to give him a good match.""Like many high school athletes, Fiegener carries a heavy academic load, taking Advanced Placement and honors classes this year while maintaining a 3.8 grade-point average.Fiegener stands out from the pack, Collier said, because of his combination of work ethic and talent.""He has the rare combination of both,"" Collier said. ""He is a great athlete and works hard and is a very coachable. He is willing to put in the time. It's no secret that in this sport you need to put in the time to be successful.""Fiegener said he gets his drive from his parents.""My dad is always telling me you are not going anywhere without that sheepskin,"" Fiegener said about his father's analogy of the material diplomas used to be made of.""I've always told him without that sheepskin you could win, but if you don't have the grades, colleges won't look at you,"" Alan Fiegener said.Fiegener finished third last season at the Masters tournament, and Collier said this weekend is a great setup for Fiegener's senior season.""The hard work he has put in has definitely shown right now and I hope it pays off for him this weekend,"" Collier said. ""He is just a fun kid to coach, and I am glad we have him for another year because this has been a tremendous year for him."""\u000a

V"I'd like to share my recent Budget Car Rental experience with you. It has me committed to never doing business with Budget again.A couple weeks ago I received a voicemail saying the Budget at the Kansas City airport would be charging me an extra $104 because an ""internal audit"" found they gave me too much of a discount.My receipt shows the $85 discount, which seemed right since there was an advertised discount.So, they billed my credit card without my authorization, and then added in all the additional taxes and fees to bring the amount up to $104. I called Budget corporate and the franchise, but nobody would help fix the issue, even though I had a receipt to prove we ""agreed"" on the lesser amount.I rent from Budget weekly, easily spending anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 a month on their cars. The franchise doesn't share information with the corporate office, so corporate is pretty much useless on the issue. Since there does not appear to be anything stopping them from charging customer credit cards at will, I refuse to ever do business with them again.Any advice?  Brandon Chase, Columbus, Ohio Some of the most hotly debated cases I mediate are pricing errors  a fare or rate in which a decimal point went astray  but I'd never come across a complaint in which a discount had been withdrawn after a trip.The Budget franchise in Kansas City should have caught any discounting error before your transaction, or at the very least, when you checked out. But leaving a voicemail weeks after your rental is highly unusual.It's probably also illegal: Budget had a contract with you, which its retroactive rebilling breached, the way I see it.I don't understand why Budget corporate couldn't help you. Isn't that what the corporate office is for? By the way, who cares if Kansas City is a franchise location? Budget's corporate structure is irrelevant to a customer, and the company shouldn't use it as an excuse. Cheap hotel chains often do this, too, and you can't let them get away with it.Fortunately, you kept excellent records. You had proof of your final payment and discount. Had you tossed your receipt this might have been a more difficult negotiation.Your appeal to Budget corporate yielded a $50 voucher  a good start. I followed up, asking why they revised your bill. It reversed the charge."\u000a

V"It's well known that Capital Stage co-founder Jonathan Rhys Williams is a handy chap to have around the theater  there's little involved with putting on a show that he can't do. What many in Sacramento don't know about Williams is that he sings a little bit, too. At the moment, Williams stars down the road at San Jose Stage in the cheeky new rock musical ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson."" With music and lyrics written by Michael Friedman and a book by Alex Timbers, who directed the off-Broadway and Broadway productions, the musical plays like a comedic Wild West show. It casts Jackson (Williams), America's controversial seventh president, as a misunderstood emo rock star who founded the Democratic Party and used questionable methods and morals in acquiring Indian-held land. ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson"" runs 7:30 Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 2 p.m. Sundays through July 29. San Jose Stage is at 490 S. First St., San Jose.

More than 200 people are expected to participate reading pre-assigned passages of ""The Odyssey,"" which tells the story of Odysseus and his 10-year struggle to reach home after the Trojan War.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/12/14/5050673/beloved-holiday-plays-characters.html,"Holiday theater has a tradition of particular themes played out through beloved stories and characters. The popularity of these productions is a blessing and a curse for theater companies.The bountiful promise of flush holiday audiences keeps the plays in regular rotation, but making the productions fresh each year provides its own challenges.For actors playing well-known characters in favorite holiday shows, there are more specific demands testing them. Jonathan Williams, who has the lead in Capital Stage's upcoming production of ""It's a Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play,"" must deal with a giant celluloid vision and the thoroughly identifiable voice of Jimmy Stewart.It was Williams' Stewart impression, which he did for fun, that inspired the production. Though he's ostensibly George Bailey as played by Jake Lawrence, the actor in the radio play, Williams is really doing a take on Stewart, re-creating the famous tone and timbre.""I've been doing a Jimmy Stewart voice around the kitchen dinner table since I was 10,"" Williams said. ""I've been honing it and playing with it for years. When we first thought of the idea of doing this show, it was kind of assumed from the beginning we'd do it this way.""This will be Capital Stage's fourth year producing the show, which transposes Frank Capra's film to a radio show being performed live in an old New York broadcasting studio.""I think it works on a more personal level when it's actually happening right there in front of you,"" Williams said.Williams and Capital Stage embrace the Stewart relationship with the character, because there's really no other way to go.""It's unlike Shakespeare in that there's no other context you can bring to it,"" Williams said. ""You can't say 'Oh well, there was that really great Ian McKellen performance of George Bailey.' There is no other performance of George Bailey  there is only Jimmy Stewart's.""Williams knows Stewart was famous not for being completely different every time out, but for bringing a singular quality to each role.""It's an acknowledgment of a great American icon of an actor,"" Williams said. ""We wouldn't be trying to portray him if he hadn't done it really, really well to start out with."" Matt K. Miller is in his fifth year playing Ebenezer Scrooge in Sacramento Theatre Company's ""A Christmas Carol."" The play, adapted and written by Richard Hellesen, has dark edges that make its Scrooge more imposing than in many productions. Miller has a classical theater background, and he thinks the character takes a Shakespearean journey.""We have this epic experience with Scrooge which runs through practically his whole lifetime,"" Miller said.Despite his familiarity with the role, Miller said it continues to fascinate him.""For me, playing Scrooge is about discovery,"" Miller said. ""What more can I discover in the character? In the scene? I never get tired of it, and I really look forward to every show even when I'm doing two a day.""Miller's half-decade as Scrooge pales in comparison with Rodger Hoopman's 33 years doing his own musical adaptation (with Rob Knable) of the story, titled ""Scrooge.""Over the years, Hoopman has performed it at the Sacramento Theatre Company, Sacramento City College, American River College, the Varsity Theatre in Davis and the Roseville Theatre. It's now the holiday show at his home theater, the Chautauqua Playhouse.The veteran performer puts basic elements of his craft to use in each performance.""As most actors will attest, one of the most important elements of acting is listening,"" Hoopman said. ""My goal for every performance is to listen and put myself in the moment so action and reaction flow instinctively.""As the years pass, and I have 'aged' into the role, I've found that I can relate to the character in new ways, physically and emotionally.""After all this time, why does Hoopman still do it?""At this point in time I'm doing it for the same reason most actors act,"" Hoopman said. ""The audience is the fuel that keeps me sharing the life of the character and telling Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' in an original and audience-friendly way.""""A CHRISTMAS CAROL""Sacramento Theatre Company presents its 25th anniversary production of the Charles Dickens story, adapted by Richard Hellesen with music by David de Berry.

All Felix has is his goldfish (Richard Bay's clever puppet) and his telephone. He talks to both endlessly.Felix goes on and on and on, talking as if his life depends on getting the words out, which in a figurative way, it does.He's trying to make the deal of lifetime, and even though no one is really working with him on it, Felix will not be deterred.As Felix, Wheeler is currently the hardest-working man in local show business. The play resembles a juggling act, requiring Wheeler to keep more and more objects in the air. It's nearly a one-man show, though Anne Mason occasionally pokes her head into Felix's office as his receptionist, Esther.Carolyn Howarth is the savvy director making the story flow with an engaging directness. The final performances are at 8 tonight and Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday. At Capital Stage, 2215 J St., Sacramento. Tickets are $22-$32.

""But what impressed me is that we were in the exact same position the next week against Ponderosa, and we got it done.""Junior offensive guard Danny Perez kicked the game-winning 35-yard field goal only seconds after learning the game's outcome rested on his foot.Jonathan Tafoya, Rio Linda's regular kicker, saw his leg tighten up during the contest, the result of an injury he suffered playing soccer, so Morris went with his backup.""He had no idea,"" Morris said of Perez.Among the other heroes for the Knights this season are senior right tackle Mitchell Gums, a force at 6-foot and 335 pounds; fast and physical sophomore running back Marcel Brown (1,097 rushing yards, 11 touchdowns), who has a scholarship offer from Nevada; senior defensive linemen Riley Smith and Michael Shane, and junior Vaughn Hingano (a combined 18 sacks); junior defensive back Keenan Hunt (five interceptions, two fumble recoveries); and junior fullback-linebacker Leo Skattebo (487 rushing yards, four touchdowns and a team-leading 74 tackles).This is Skattebo's first full season of football after breaking his leg midway through his freshman season and missing his entire sophomore year with a broken clavicle.""Leo's a beast,"" Morris said. ""He's 5-10, 245 pounds and one of the strongest guys on the team. He's extremely athletic, and he has the drive. He wants to be great.""In remembrance  The memory of popular former teammate Christian Daniels, who died July 28 in a motorcycle accident, still drives the players at No. 13 Whitney. The Wildcats are 7-1 and 3-0 in the Capital Athletic League.""Christian's name comes up a lot, especially among the seniors who were his teammates last season,"" said Whitney coach Mike Gimenez. ""And that's a great way to remember him. He was a great kid, with a big smile, great spirit who always made the people around him better.""Daniels, 18, died shortly after graduating from Whitney. He was the prototypical overachiever at 5-9 and 160 pounds, nicknamed ""Little Bear"" by his family because of his small stature but toughness and speed as a wide receiver and kick specialist.Nearly 1,000 people attended a candlelight vigil for Daniels in Whitney's football stadium.""The players wear a sticker on the back of their helmets in his memory,"" Gimenez said. ""We've started a memorial scholarship fund in his name that will earn one of our football players some money to go to college.""Still in the running  Rio Americano kept alive its playoff hopes Saturday by beating visiting Mira Loma 80-34 in a Capital Athletic League game.Mark Lyon passed for 253 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for two more; Guillermo Salazar had six catches for 118 yards and two touchdowns, and he returned an interception 87 yards for another touchdown; and Darrin Nishi and Jordan Vinson combined to rush for 210 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Raiders, now 4-4 overall and 2-1 in league."\u000a

V"Both teams endured ailments, including bouts of the flu, and other forms of adversity in this combined season of great promise.The feel-good tonic was winning and supporting each other.Friday night at Sleep Train Arena, the postgame mood was collectively upbeat for Capital Christian High School, the big picture crystal clear. This is a game, not the end of the world, nor is it the biggest achievement of their young lives. The girls fell to Brookside Christian 72-28 in their first trip to the NBA arena, wearing a collective look of shock but thrilled for the opportunity.Some two hours later, the Capital Christian boys were beaming after beating Brookside Christian 40-39 to repeat as Division V champions.Two teams, one school and a continued shared goal of extending basketball seasons into March. The boys expect to earn a high D-V seed when the Northern California Regional field is announced Sunday.The girls also will advance, albeit as a lower seed on the road. Nicole Colbert led the Cougars (20-10) with seven points and seven rebounds. Tiara Tucker scored 24 points for Brookside (26-4), which repeated as D-V champions.""We're really happy to just get here, and we fought to the end,"" said Suzanne Baker, in her 17th season coaching the Capital Christian girls. ""This is new for us. I'm proud of how the girls played. We've overcome so much  serious injuries, the flu. It's a big stage here. Our guys' team is used to it.""The boys program lost five straight D-V section finals to Modesto Christian last decade but now have its second blue banner in as many seasons.First-year Capital coach Devon Jones said it's easy to forget these are still teenagers trying to make contested shots in such a big setting, even free throws, as junior guard Tyler Jennings can attest.Moments after missing two free throws, the junior calmly made one with .07 left to account for his team's margin of victory. He intentionally missed the second to help run out the clock.Following a timeout, Brookside (27-2) was short on a three-quarter-court heave at the horn, and so went the Stockton school's 16-game winning streak.Jennings' free-throw backdrop was a quiet, calm school rooting section that erupted on his make  and when the game was over. ""I was nervous,"" Jennings confessed. ""I knew I couldn't let my team down.""Capital Christian (24-4) prevailed despite going cold in the second half and not having explosive 6-foot-8 junior wing D.J. Wilson, who was out after suffering a back injury Thursday.Guard Uchenna Iroegbu and forward Trey Belton each scored nine points. Belton had 11 rebounds and keyed a defense that stalled the Knights, who lead all D-V teams in scoring at 86 points a game. Guard Justice Shelton-Mosley scored eight points and post Nifae Lealao seven to go with six rebounds.Lealao, who has attracted national football recruiting interest, is a free-spirited scholar into fashion and design. He said his team also understands it can share a message of unity in the form of footwear. Each of the Cougars boys wore pink shoes, ""Because we all know someone who has cancer,"" Lealao said.The Cougars seek the school's first state title in any sport.""We've been through everything  flu, broken bones, torn ACLs, bad backs  and we keep with it,"" Jones said. ""We've gone through all of that and I like our chances. These guys want more. They have great character."""\u000a

V"When the First Methodist Church in Roseville opened 130 years ago, even the bars stopped serving to pay their respects.The dedication of the Methodist house of worship on March 4, 1883, was marked by saloons closing for the day and bar keeps donating $900 to the congregation.""The entire community contributed towards the cost of the church,"" said Phoebe Astill, a fourth-generation member of the church. ""The day of the dedication, the town closed down, including the bars and brothels, so everyone could come attend church service.""That brick building still stands today at the corner of Washington and Church streets on land donated by Anna F. Judah, the wife of railroad pioneer Theodore Judah. This week, the church members commemorate its founding with several events.The small, brick church building was constructed at a cost of $2,500, using donated labor by church faithful who previously worshipped in homes and a barn.""My great-grandfather, James Astill, helped build that building,"" said Phoebe Astill. ""It is still used all the time.""Around 1907, Southern Pacific Railroad moved its shops to Roseville, bringing growth and jobs. However, the church still did not have gas service or running water in the early 1920s.Methodists are no different from other church members in their desire to gather and eat together -- so a lack of utilities did not stop the congregation from cooking on the property.Women brought coal oil stoves from home and chairs were borrowed from an undertaker. In 1923, a lean-two kitchen was built for a budgeted $500. Much to the delight of the congregation, it had a sink, cupboard and gas range.Now, the women of the congregation did not have to bring cooking utensils from home. Potatoes, it is said, were cooked in washtubs to feed hungry Methodists. A chicken dinner cost 50 cents a plate.Through the years, the church has changed names and pastors. A new church was dedicated in 1952.The original church is still used most days of the week for meetings, and early church services on Sundays. Through the years, the congregation has included doctors, teachers, business owners and railroad employees.The membership, probably a couple hundred in number, is older than some other congregations these days, whose services are enlivened with bands, dance and guitars.""We still use the piano and the organ,"" said Astill. The current pastor is Paul Joseph Yang.Plans for the weekend include a dinner and historical church program on Friday evening. On Saturday a barbecue, tours of the building and entertainment will be held from 11:00 a.m.to 3:00 p.m.During Sunday service at 10:15 a.m., former pastors of the church will be participating in worship. Contact Donna Damman at (916) 783-0775 for Friday dinner reservations and information."\u000a

V"The reminders of Sacramento's struggles with gun violence are constant.Police reported a 21 percent increase last year in major crimes involving guns. On New Year's Eve, two people were fatally shot inside a packed Old Sacramento bar. And earlier this month, police found guns on the campuses of two Natomas schools in what they said were unrelated incidents.Now, at the urging of Councilman Jay Schenirer, who represents Oak Park and other city neighborhoods troubled by gun crime, city lawyers are analyzing a menu of options for stricter regulations on firearm dealers and certain types of ammunition. Sacramento already has among the most stringent gun control laws in the nation, but the City Council could debate enacting even tougher restrictions as early as April.""It's time to send a really strong message that on gun issues, we're going to take action,"" Schenirer said. ""I don't want to do things just for show. We need to do everything we can to take guns and ammunition out of the hands of people who should not have them.""Sacramento's gun debate, like others going on around the country, was spurred in part by December's fatal shooting of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.Events closer to home also provided a push. Following the New Year's Eve shootings of four people in an Old Sacramento bar, two of whom died, Mayor Kevin Johnson proposed a gun-buyback program. That proposal is still being examined, and Johnson said he supports Schenirer's ""efforts to see how we can take swift action.""""It's vital that we explore every opportunity to improve the safety of our community,"" the mayor said Thursday.City staff members have drawn up a list of eight regulations the City Council could enact that do not interfere with state or federal laws. Those options were presented last week to the council's Law and Legislation Committee, which directed staff members and police officials to analyze what impact the potential new laws would have on gun violence in the city.Possible ordinances include regulating where firearm dealers could operate; requiring gun shops to increase in-store security and to prohibit people under age 21 from entering their establishments; and banning the sale and possession of .50-caliber ammunition.Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, warned that the city is opening itself up to a legal battle if it places additional restrictions on gun dealers.""There is a strong potential to go to court and sue the city to say they are placing an undue burden on businesses that specifically provide the products that allow people to exercise their Second Amendment rights,"" he said.Still, Paredes doesn't appear confident the City Council will heed his warning.""Unfortunately, right now there isn't a member of the Sacramento City Council that is a supporter of the Second Amendment,"" he said. ""They are inclined to go way to the left of the right to keep and bear arms, and some are downright hostile to that right.""Juliet Leftwich, legal director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, offered a different view.""Public support for common-sense gun laws has never been stronger,"" she said Thursday.Leftwich said there has been a resurgence in local governments debating tougher gun laws since the Newtown tragedy. She said those laws can be effective in ""filling in the gaps in state and federal laws,"" especially when it comes to restricting where gun dealers can operate.""It's important for states to step up, and when they don't, it's important for local governments to do so,"" she said.The gun control debate is being waged at the state Capitol and in cities and counties around California.At the Capitol, where elected leaders often boast of what they call the nation's strictest firearm regulations, a handful of bills have been introduced in recent months.The proposed laws include requiring ammunition dealers to have permits. Customers would have to show identification when they purchase ammunition. A tax break has also been floated for gun owners who voluntarily surrender a firearm to a local government conducting a buyback program.The Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors last month placed a temporary hold on allowing new gun stores in the county and is considering tough restrictions on those shops. In San Francisco, Mayor Ed Lee and Supervisor Malia Cohen last month floated a bill that would make it illegal to possess hollow-point bullets. The law would also require gun shops to tell police when a customer buys more than 500 rounds of ammunition.In Sacramento, an ordinance crafted by Councilman Kevin McCarty in 2007 requires those who buy ammunition in the city to show identification and give their thumbprints. The records are cross-checked with state Department of Justice data to see if those customers are permitted to own guns.Since it went into effect, the law has led to 230 guns being confiscated. But over the last two years, the rate of guns being taken has declined, in part due to customers buying ammunition in neighboring jurisdictions without the restrictions, McCarty said.That has led McCarty and others to advocate for stronger statewide and regional laws.""If we have it and our neighbors don't, there's only so much we can do,"" he said."\u000a

V"For the second time in as many months, the Galt community is grieving after a local officer was shot and killed Tuesday trying to track down a burglary suspect.K-9 Officer Kevin Tonn, a 3 1/2-year veteran of Galt's police force, died at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, south Sacramento, after suffering a single gunshot wound while wrestling with a man believed to have been involved in a break-in less than a block away.That suspect, who had not been identified by late Tuesday, fired at the second arriving officer before turning his gun on himself, according to authorities. He was pronounced dead in the grassy field where the men had struggled, not far from the railroad tracks that run through the small, rural town in south Sacramento County.Several members of the 36-officer Police Department showed up to an afternoon press conference with somber faces and black mourning bands already wrapped around their badges.Tonn ""was a very well-respected, very proactive member of our department,"" said Lt. Jim Uptegrove, who oversees the small K-9 unit that included Tonn. ""His loss is extremely tragic to us and to our community. It's definitely a loss that will be felt throughout.""The shooting unfolded from what at first appeared to be a routine call of a burglary in progress at a duplex in the 200 block of F Street.The call came in at 11:18 a.m., said Sacramento County Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Ramos. Officers arrived on the scene at 11:25 a.m. and found that the door of a duplex had been kicked in.Shortly after 11:30 a.m., a man was reported walking along the railroad tracks near the burglary scene.Tonn parked his patrol car along the tracks, left his canine partner, Yaro, inside and tried to contact the man. At 11:34 a.m., dispatchers were alerted that an officer was in a fight  possibly by Tonn himself radioing for help  and two minutes later a second officer reported shots fired and an ""officer down.""Uptegrove said investigators later learned that during the struggle with Tonn, the suspect pulled out a handgun and shot the officer once. He turned to run, but then fired several shots at the next arriving officer before shooting himself.The second officer, who was not hurt, was not able to return fire because of the position in which he had taken cover, Uptegrove said. Tonn also did not fire any shots, he said.As of Tuesday afternoon, police had not confirmed that the gunman was the suspect in the earlier burglary, Uptegrove said.The call of an officer down brought police racing to the scene from throughout the region, including Sacramento County sheriff's deputies, who took over patrol duties so Galt's officers could grieve.That agency's homicide detectives are investigating the shooting.Uptegrove described Tonn as ""hardworking"" and ""friendly,"" and said the officer was well-known among local criminals. Before graduating from the Sheriff's Academy in 2009 and joining the Galt Police Department, Tonn worked as a firefighter and paramedic in New York, Uptegrove said.He said chaplains were available to help Tonn's colleagues cope with the loss. ""We are a very small agency, and we're a very family-oriented agency,"" he said.Tonn is only the second Galt police officer to die on duty that officials could remember; the first was an officer who died in 1989 after suffering a heart attack.The last line-of-duty deaths in the Sacramento region occurred in 2008, when Yolo County Sheriff's Deputy Jose Antonio ""Tony"" Diaz was fatally shot and Sacramento County Sheriff's Deputy Larry Canfield died in a motorcycle collision.As the community waited for word of Tonn's condition  knowing only that an officer had been shot  some residents gathered at the police tape and exchanged information and rumor.Still on the minds of some was Sacramento County Animal Control Officer Roy Marcum, shot to death Nov. 28 while tending to animals believed to have been left behind by an evicted resident.That shooting happened just down the street from Tuesday's incident. A second act of violence so soon after and so near the site of Marcum's death came as a shock to some  one amplified by the fact that many in Galt know their local cops by name, residents said.""It's just a small town,"" said 20-year-old Luis Vizcara. ""Everyone knows everyone.""Steve Langley lives just across the street from the grassy lot where Tonn was shot. He came home in time to see Tonn's fellow officers carrying him frantically to a waiting stretcher. Upon hearing Tonn had died, Langley shook his head.""There's probably a lot of people who do know the officer and it's probably going to make a bigger impact  a bigger impact here than in other cities,"" said Langley, 50. ""It's just a sad, sad thing."""\u000a

V"Hours before attending a ceremony to sign letters of intent in the Sheldon High School library Wednesday night, five Huskies basketball players plopped down onto a couch in the athletic lounge.Each smiled, then exhaled, as if this were the calm before the storm.A season filled with great expectations started with three seniors accepting scholarships and two other starters still in the college recruiting mix. Last season's Bee Player of the Year D'Erryl Williams, a 6-foot-2 point guard, and fellow Bee first-team All-Metro teammate Dakarai Allen, a 6-6 swingman, are headed to San Diego State, where the Aztecs in recent years have moved up in the rankings and have been fixtures in the NCAA Tournament.Darin Johnson, a 6-3 combo player, is headed to Washington. Johnson grew up playing on youth and AAU teams alongside Williams and Allen, even while attending Franklin High, from where he transferred last spring.Then there are Sheldon's other seniors, Ryan Manning and Armani Hampton. Manning, a 6-6 wing with good three-point range, said he hopes to sign a scholarship deal in the coming months. Hampton, a 6-3 combo guard, may miss this season after re-injuring his surgically repaired knee that kept him out of last year's run to the state championship game.Not since Jesuit in the early 1990s has a regional team had so much talent. Sheldon reached the state Division I final last season, falling to national power Mater Dei of Santa Ana.The Sac-Joaquin Section has not won a D-I large-school state title.""This is an easy group to coach when they do everything right  students, players, good kids,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said.Williams and Allen said San Diego State is a good fit, especially after being given a tour of the area and the beaches by current Aztecs players they know well  Chase Tapley of Sacramento High and Xavier Thames of Pleasant Grove.""It just felt right,"" Allen said.Each player said he worked just as hard in the classroom as he did on the court to achieve his scholarship. Without qualifying transcripts, there is no chance to land a scholarship.""In my household, we always did homework first  school was the most important thing,"" Williams said.Johnson agreed, adding, ""We wouldn't be going to college without good grades.""Though Allen proudly wears his San Diego State cap, flat brim and all, he said he doesn't talk much about his scholarship.""We don't want people to think we're gloating,"" he said. ""But it does feel good.""Added Rollings, their coach: ""They should be proud. It's hard to get a scholarship.""

V"DEAR CAROLYN: I'm in a relationship with a great guy. We're talking marriage. Everything is wonderful, except for a communication issue that has become our ""repeat fight.""I am a planner, and he is not. I'm on the road for work a few times a month, and he works overnights and sometimes goes for two weeks without a day off. We'd never see each other if I didn't size up our schedules and plan ahead  at least, that's my opinion.He says this kind of weekly micromanaging is stressful for him. His job already demands enough, and having to chart out his few free days freaks him out. He promises we're going to see each other without the constant planning because he misses me and will prioritize me.He has always put our relationship first, so I don't doubt his best intentions. In his perfect world, he'd call me after work to see if I was free, and if I wasn't, he'd ask about tomorrow or the next day.But I'd always be in limbo, still inclined to look at my schedule and keep a few days a week free to essentially be ""on call"" for hanging out whenever he decides he wants to. It doesn't seem fair.In the end we both want the same thing: to see each other. Where is our middle ground? Do I need to give his way a try? Color-Coded CalendarDEAR COLOR-CODED: Yes, if only because you apparently haven't.You have, meanwhile, been color-coding his free days for quite some time. You think you'd never see each other, but you both know tight scheduling stresses him out.Another argument for backing off involves boundaries (doesn't it always). In my perfect world, you'd manage your time, and he'd manage his  which includes any minor, non-grudging adjustments to allow the two ways to get along.That might look like this: You calendar-box him in when it's necessary to  say, when reservations need to be made, tickets need to be bought, others need to be included  and you leave the rest blank. Those blank days are yours to fill with friends, leave empty, allot to activities that allow flexibility, or some unforced combination of the three.If he happens to be free the day you've made plans to see friends? Tell him so, ask him about ""tomorrow or the next day,"" then see your friends as planned.In other words, don't go halfway and act as if you're scheduling your own time while you're really just waiting for him, and don't set it up as a gotcha-trap. Commit to treating your time as yours and his time as his, as the logical thing to do, and see what actually happens. Let the natural consequences of not planning kick in. It's not a ""communication issue,"" it's about compatibility, and this exercise will tell you how deep it goes. Before you marry.If you wind up seeing each other as much as always, sans recurring arguments, then, yay. If you see each other less and he misses you, then he'll likely welcome some micromanagement. Yay again.If you see less of each other and he's fine with that, then it's time to figure out: Do you care more than he does? Do you care equally, but show it differently? And, most important, can you each reconcile this without expecting the other to change?"\u000a

V"A snow-covered popular Placer County hiking trail was reopened Tuesday after a state Fish and Wildlife warden was forced to shoot and kill a mountain lion Sunday, authorities say.Authorities were first alerted to an aggressive mountain lion Saturday evening when a hiker on the Stevens Trail near Colfax, fearing for his safety, called 911.""He noticed he was being followed by a mountain lion,"" said Mark Michilizzi, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. ""The behavior was consistent with a mountain lion that is stalking prey.""Fish and Wildlife wardens, Placer County sheriff's deputies and a California Highway Patrol helicopter responded to the call and apparently scared off the mountain lion, Michilizzi said.Sunday morning, a warden returned to the area to post signs and warn hikers of the threat of an aggressive mountain lion when he noticed a cougar, apparently the same one, preparing to pounce on him, Michilizzi said.While it is illegal to hunt mountain lions in California, at that point the animal wasn't just a risk to public safety, officials said. It was a risk to the warden, who shot and killed the cat.""The officer acted appropriately,"" Michilizzi said. ""The mountain lion wasn't cornered. The mountain lion was actively approaching him.""Michilizzi said a necropsy will be performed to help officials learn more about the health of the animal and what might have triggered the behavior.""Deer are the primary prey for mountain lion,"" Michilizzi said. ""When they start looking to humans, we want to know why.""He said hikers should not call 911 when spotting a mountain lion, but this instance was different.""Mountain lion attacks are rare. This type of behavior is rare,"" Michilizzi said.He advised anyone who spots a mountain lion not to run. Instead, turn and face the lion while making oneself as big as possible and throw rocks, sticks or leaves, he advised."\u000a

V"WASHINGTON  A team that's spent two decades studying psychological distress among residents who lived near the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska has found striking similarities among those affected by the Deepwater Horizon spill. On the one-year anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico, the research team warned that the lingering psychological effects of the disaster could be expected to continue over the next decade. Technological disasters have very unique consequences for communities, families and people, said Steve Picou, a sociology professor at the University of South Alabama in Mobile. It's not like a natural disaster. Technological disasters cause long-term corrosive communities, whereas natural disasters result in therapeutic communities. The team has been studying the long-term social costs of the Exxon spill, including increased rates of bankruptcies, substance abuse, divorce and suicides. They picked Bayou La Batre, Ala., for comparison, because like Cordova, Alaska, it's a small community heavily dependent on commercial fishing. Picou, along with Liesel Ritchie of the University of Colorado Boulder's Natural Hazards Center and Duane Gill of Oklahoma State University, surveyed more than 400 people in south Mobile County, Ala. Most people were worried about their health or that of their family, the economic loss they've suffered and potential future economic losses because of the spill, the team found. Of those surveyed, more than a fifth were in severe psychological distress. Another fourth were in the moderate distress range  findings that were similar to Cordova following the Exxon Valdez spill. Several people told us: 'We know what to do after a hurricane. We know how to pick ourselves up and move on. How to plan, how to build better,' Gill said. 'This oil spill? We don't know. There's so many uncertainties associated with it.' The anniversary of the spill has caused many to reflect in Cordova, where a state-ordered oil spill response drill was under way Wednesday afternoon. For Osa Schultz, the discussion about the safety of Gulf Coast seafood is especially eerie. It's one they struggled with in Alaska, which lost market share because of the taint of the spill  if not the actual harm to fisheries. I can't help but think about what the people in the Gulf are doing, the small businesses and the residents, and reflect on the many years that we've fought to even come back up to even. Or try to anyway, said Schultz, who continues to run a fishing boat with her husband.  The researchers hope that what they've learned in Cordova since 1989 will aid those in the Gulf of Mexico. They've taken a so-called peer listening program they used on a much smaller scale in Alaska to the Gulf, where they've trained more than 600 people in the concept.  The program teaches people in the community to help steer their friends, family and co-workers to professional help or resources. People are trained to listen for the root causes of problems, he said. If someone is drinking too much, for example, is it because he's worried about losing his home? If so, there's often a way to gently point him in the direction of a program that helps avoid foreclosure, he said. The researchers also teach peer listeners what not to say. They never should say that they know how someone feels, because they don't, Picou said. They also don't tell people to get over it or to move on, he said. And clergy who train as peer listeners are advised not to tell people that God will take care of it. Instead, the researchers suggest that clergy offer to pray with someone who's in distress. Although the program was designed to be used in future disasters in Alaska, it's portable, Picou said. It clearly demonstrates that this was an important lesson learned from the Exxon Valdez, Picou said, one that is very applicable in the Gulf.  Gill warned that a great source of future anxiety for victims of the Deepwater Horizon spill could come from the uncertainty of unresolved litigation. In Alaska, the lawsuit to determine punitive damages went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided the case 19 years after the spill.

V"LOS ANGELES  Diondre Batson is used to being chased. Ever since his junior year at Laguna Creek High School and in two seasons competing for American River College, he has established himself as one of the top young sprinters in the western United States.So here he found himself on a cool, clear day at UCLA's Drake Stadium chasing not another athlete, but a mark, in his quest to qualify for the U.S. Olympic Trials in the 100-meter dash.Batson on Saturday won yet another 100 crown in a time of 10.29 at the USA Track & Field Jim Bush SoCal Championships, besting 39 other runners. But he would gladly trade the medal he won  one that never went around his neck but rather in his gear bag along with his spikes and goggles  for an invitation to run in the 100 at the Olympic Trials later this month in Eugene, Ore.""I don't know if I'm going to get it now,"" Batson said, visibly dejected following the race.His ticket to the Trials is already booked with a qualified 200 time, but his goal is to double up. Batson already has the ""B"" qualifying standard of 10.28, but that is provisional since those who run faster than 10.18 automatically qualify. Batson and his coach, Rick Anderson, both believe the field will fill with automatic berths. He has until June 19 to run it in a USATF-sanctioned meet.The plan now is to run in the San Diego-Imperial Association Championships next Sunday in Chula Vista. Batson, his mother, Sonja, and likely a group of friends and family who were at UCLA on Saturday will make the drive.Sonja Batson, a former sprinter, said she doesn't mind the driving as long as she gets to see Diondre compete in the sport they both so enjoy.""I still cheer for him like it's his very first meet,"" said Sonja, who has driven Diondre as far as Iowa to compete in races.Those lungs have received a workout, and Diondre has been peerless in California this year in winning every 100 he has run. Unfortunate circumstances, though, have kept him from the elusive mark. He did break the 10.18 barrier in the NorCal Community College Championship meet last month in San Mateo, but his 10.10 included more than the allowed tailwind.At the state championships in Norwalk, he ran 10.36 into a stiff 2.3-meters- per-second headwind.Saturday, he said two false starts caused him to be a bit tentative getting out of the blocks when the race was finally legal. On both starts that were called back, he appeared to be out more rapidly than on the third.""That's the biggest part of the race,"" he said. ""If you get out horrible, you lose or can only barely win."""\u000a

V"Nate Harris has never seen anything like it.During the second day of practice last month, the new West Campus football coach suddenly found himself without two scheduled games for the upcoming season.First, Harris discovered that the verbal commitment he had made with the former coach-athletic director at Fresno Christian to play the private-school team in Fresno wasn't going to be honored.Then, 15 minutes later, he got a call from an assistant coach at Woodland Poly, a second-year charter school, who told Harris the Buffaloes would be unable to play the Warriors on Sept. 8 at Burbank High School. (Woodland Poly is playing an abbreviated five-game season starting Sept. 22, according to coach Steve Marks Jr.)""I was as mad as a pit bull with no teeth,"" said the folksy Harris, an area coaching veteran who also has coached at Highlands, Sacramento and Kennedy.Harris was able to scramble and schedule Skyline of Oakland for a home game on Sept. 29. But he had his fingers crossed the entire drive to Oakland last Friday to scout Skyline in its game against Granada of Livermore.Skyline's coach told the Oakland Tribune several days earlier that its season might be in jeopardy after forfeiting the Aug. 31 opener to Acalanes of Lafayette because only 13 of his players were eligible.A new, more stringent academic policy in the Oakland Athletic League is taking a toll  and not just at Skyline.Castlemont also canceled its varsity and junior varsity games Friday against Vista del Lago at Folsom High School, a hit that Vista coach Chris Jones says will cost his program $7,000 in gate revenue.But on Friday, Skyline played Granada and lost 28-0.Harris figures West Campus, which snapped a 28-game losing streak in its season opener Aug. 24, should play nine games this season, despite being in the midst of a 22-day break between games.Neutral observer  Placer coach Joey Montoya watched most of Saturday's Football for Families showcase game between Casa Roble and Fruitland of Idaho in the south end zone at Oak Ridge High School.""It's tough,"" Montoya said. ""You want to root for a team from your section, but we have a great friendship with Fruitland. So that's why I'm standing here. I'm Switzerland right now.""Montoya got to know Fruitland coach Bruce Schlaich while working a football camp in the Idaho community this summer. Like Placer, Fruitland runs a wing-T offense.Montoya is considering taking the Hillmen, who beat Foothill of Palo Cedro on Friday at Oak Ridge, to Idaho next fall for a possible showcase event in Boise.His No. 8 Hillmen (2-0) meet Casa Roble (1-2), which lost 29-22 to Fruitland, this Friday in Auburn in their annual nonleague rivalry that has become a down-to-the-wire battle in recent years.Casa Roble won 61-58 last season and 41-33 in 2010; Placer won in 2009, 31-30.Carrying his weight  Sacramento High's three-year starter Ian Howerton will be a busy guy this weekend.The senior captain will lead the Dragons against River City in West Sacramento this Friday night, then hop a flight Saturday morning for Eastern Europe.The 6-foot-3, 190-pound Howerton will compete in the International Weightlifting Federation Youth World Championships in Kosice, Slovakia.Howerton's strong play at tackle along with that of quarterback Josiah Johnson and running back Louis Macklin helped the Dragons to beat Foothill of North Highlands 48-18 last Friday.Big run  Encina running back Maurice Campbell tied state and national records last Saturday when he scored a 99-yard touchdown run in the Bulldogs' 32-2 win over Kennedy at El Camino."\u000a

V"At age 8, guitarist Julian Lage was already getting more screen time than most of his jazz contemporaries.He earned that as the focus of the 1996 Oscar- nominated documentary ""Julian at Eight.""It was no surprise that Lage, who grew up in a semi-rural patch of Santa Rosa, would be the focus of a documentary at such an early age. After all, he was a guitar prodigy, having performed publicly in restaurants and clubs in the Bay Area.A year later would see Lage performing at the Grammys.Today at 25, he still looks as fresh faced. His standing as an innovative and genre-bending guitarist is one that critics often describe with superlatives. Starting Wednesday, Lage and the jazz ensemble that bears his name make a four-night appearance at the Mondavi Center at UC Davis. In addition to Lage, the band consists of saxophonist Dan Blake, cellist Aristides Rivas, bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Tupac Mantilla. The result promises to be a blend of jazz, folk and Latin music. The Julian Lage Group will perform works from his debut album ""Sounding Point,"" a nominee for the 2010 Grammy Award for best contemporary jazz album. The band will also tap works from the recently released album ""Gladwell."" Lage will also perform new works.The Bee talked to Lage, via phone from his apartment on New York's Upper West Side, about his unique musical upbringing and his approach to the band. What was it like growing up in Santa Rosa?It was wonderful despite it being kind of a rural setting. There was a vibrant music scene there, so from an early age I was exposed to a host of performers, educators and performers, as well as local colleges.Did growing up there impart anything to you musically?I felt I was in the best possible place for a young musician. It not only gave me balance, it also protected me. It allowed me to grow and explore things I was interested in. By the same token it also created a real excitement for moving away to go to college.Your father played the guitar. Was he a big influence?He's the reason I started on the guitar. I saw him play, and I wanted to join in. He's a brilliant thinker and good at breaking things down. At the time, he was studying blues scales and progressions with his teacher. He'd come home from lessons and would teach me the scales. I started to improvise on them. He'd play the accompanying blues parts  the progression and changes.You played with older jazz musicians in Bay Area restaurants and clubs as a kid. What did you learn from that?I learned more than I think I can articulate. My dad would drive me, and we would meet these people, and then we would go back home  nothing too spectacular. I remember it as a really enjoyable time. I was probably learning about the qualities that professional musicians must have  like how to set up, how to structure a set list and how to arrange music for bands I wanted to play with.What did you learn when you attended the Berklee College of Music?I went there at 18. It was a two-year program and was structured like a graduate program. It was phenomenal because it was so tailored to my needs. I studied with Mick Goodrick every week for two years. I studied classical composition every week, three days a week. I also studied classical piano. I got to do ensemble work with Joe Lovano, Hal Crook and all these stellar teachers. I wanted to come out of it with a band of my own that incorporated classical composition and improvisation. My final project was what became my first record  ""Sounding Point.""I understand your latest album, ""Gladwell,"" has a unique story arc to it.""Gladwell,"" being a second record, was kind of an experiment. The organizing principle of the record is that it's the story of a fictional town called Gladwell. In this town there are different goings-on and happenings. Different types of people live there. It was really a kind of an experiment to see if that would inspire any specific kind of composition or musical organization.I understand that Stravinsky and Debussy are influences.More than anything, I'm a fan of their music. I love the orchestral qualities of their music, like the relationship of motion from the harmonic to the melodic. My intent, as a composer, is to use anything about music that I love.What's next for Julian Lage and the Julian Lage Group?I feel like the Julian Lage Group is morphing into a collective, of sorts. It feels like a five-headed monster, and increasingly I feel the desire to relinquish some of the control of it being my band and my vehicle. It's now this other thing  so with regard to future recording projects? I'm not rushing to do anything under my name.JULIAN LAGE GROUPWhen: 8 p.m., Wednesday-Saturday Where: Vanderhoef Studio Theatre, Mondavi Center, UC DavisTickets: $38-$42Information: (530) 754-2787; www.MondaviArts.org"\u000a

V"Having never seen or heard the painter Mark Rothko, it's impossible to say if actor Brian Dykstra channels the influential artist or not. Dykstra channels something deep, though, in his heavyweight performance of the raging abstract expressionist master in John Logan's ""Red,"" opening the B Street Theatre's new B3 Series.By all accounts, Rothko was prickly, demanding and obsessively consumed with making his art. Logan's 2010 Tony-winning play presents him just so. Neither the writing nor Dykstra's captivating, larger-than-life performance attempt to manufacture a charming or sympathetic rogue from Rothko's imposing profile. Instead, they create a fascinating, implacable, unpredictable, intellectual bully. Don't even try taking your eyes off him. You can't, and you shouldn't miss a moment of the onstage excellence.On the receiving end of Rothko/Dykstra's bombast is David McElwee's Ken, the artist's new assistant. The play  based on actual events  follows the fictitious Ken's tenure with Rothko in 1958-59, when the artist had just accepted a commission to paint a group of murals for the new Four Seasons restaurant being built on Park Avenue. Beverage magnate Seagram and Sons had funded the building designed by architects Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, who asked Rothko for the paintings. Rothko agreed to provide paintings, though executing the commission forced him to reconcile fiercely held beliefs about the art world in general and his own work in particular. At one point in the play, Rothko suggests his underlying intent is to paint something that will, ""ruin the appetite of every son of a bitch who ever eats in that room. If the restaurant would refuse to put up my murals, that would be the ultimate compliment."" The two-man play takes place completely in Rothko's studio (Elizabeth Hadden designed the convincing set) with the imposing, shimmering canvases lining the walls.To McElwee's credit, Ken, a young painter himself, does much more than simply get run over by Rothko's passions. As they go about the work of making art  and for Rothko, it is very much work within the prescribed hours of 9 to 5 each day  Ken absorbs Rothko's dense philosophical ideas about the paintings. Ken eventually turns Rothko's voluminous discourse back on the older painter. For Rothko, the work contains an emotional, spiritual content that goes far beyond the floating, rectangular shapes buoyed on subtly shaded colors based on  what else?  red. Yet as one of the play's more memorable riffs demonstrates, ""red"" can be a rather vague word.Somewhat like Rothko's work, the actors carefully layer the play's surprising physicality with specific nuance and meaning. Director Jerry Montoya establishes an arresting pace for both the action and equally visceral dialogue, propelling this really sublime production.REDFour StarsWhat: John Logan's 2010 Tony Award-winning drama ""Red"" about the abstract expressionist master Mark Rothko and his contentious relationship with a young assistant while painting a commission for the Four Seasons restaurant.When: 7 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays; 8 p.m. Saturdays; 1 p.m. Sundays through Sept. 22 Where: B Street Theatre B3 Stage, 2711 B St., Sacramento.

V"He goes by ""The Freak"" and no wonder.Freakish in the weight room. Freakish off the line of scrimmage as a rush-end specialist. Freakish stats.Say hello to Zack Claiborne, No. 31 in your program and registering as ""too much"" in the minds of every foe he faces.The Oak Ridge High School senior defensive end set a tone by refusing to be blocked, recording four of his team's seven sacks, and the No. 7 Trojans were balanced behind quarterback Jason Samuels with methodical drives or big-play ability in belting No. 8 Pleasant Grove 38-19 Friday night at Sheldon High School in a Delta River League game with league title implications.At 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, Claiborne isn't being nationally recruited at defensive end. But he'll surely play somewhere next season, perhaps linebacker, because of his ability and motor, his coaches say. His teammates say Claiborne is a sight to behold in practice and in the weight room, too, a leader in example and results.""That's why we call him 'Freak,' "" said Samuels, a 4.0 student who passed for 225 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown to Ross Dwelley in the second quarter. Oak Ridge also rushed for 251 yards behind Blake Martin (touchdowns of one yard and 44 yards) and Tanner Hughes (powerful scoring bursts of seven and 10 yards).Claiborne had 11 1/2 sacks last season and now has a school-record 16 1/2, the most in Northern California this season. Last week, Claiborne's late sack and forced fumble sealed a 20-17 victory over rival Ponderosa.""Zack continues to play well,"" Oak Ridge coach Eric Cavaliere said. ""The whole 'big players make big plays in big games' statement certainly rings true with him.""Oak Ridge (8-1) quickly trailed 12-0 after Sedrick Allen returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a score and Isaiah Saunders scored from a yard out after a Trojans fumble. Saunders also had a 20-yard touchdown run for the Eagles (6-3) but was held to 62 rushing yards with little room to work. After the early hiccups, it was all Trojans in a crush of line dominance.Claiborne was joined on the defensive front by Chandler Christy, another relentless senior at 5-9 and 190 pounds. He had 2 1/2 sacks after coming in with three this season.The Trojans' offensive line was just as physical in controlling the tempo. That unit is headed by twins Joseph and Jason Chapman, Cory Greg- ersen, Kareem Ballal and Jacob Proul.""You look at them, and they don't have any weaknesses,"" Pleasant Grove coach Joe Cattolico said before the game. ""They're the most balanced team in our league, and they present some challenges.""Pleasant Grove still seeks a share of its fifth league championship since 2007 and needs a win at No. 2 Folsom next week. Oak Ridge can secure a share of its first DRL title if it wins next week against Jesuit and Pleasant Grove topples Folsom."\u000a

V"""Saturday Night Wrist"" Deftones (2006)Had it not been for this downtown recording space, the Deftones might still be a local garage band instead of Grammy winners who are touring the world. Back when the Hangar was called Enharmonik Studios, it's where the Deftones recorded the demo that landed them a deal with Maverick/Warner Bros.The Deftones returned to the Hangar for their 2006 album ""Saturday Night Wrist,"" considered among the most turbulent sessions of the band's career. Marred by band infighting and difficulties jibing with the album's original producer, Bob Ezrin of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" fame, the group went on hiatus during its recording.While the album was eventually recorded in numerous spots, including the Deftones' West Sacramento rehearsal space and Malibu's Morning View House, originally made famous by Incubus, ""Saturday Night Wrist"" coalesced at the Hangar, with production from Shaun Lopez of Far/ Revolution Smile fame. It ultimately reached No. 10 on Billboard's album charts. ""WHVN"" Will Haven (1999)The Hangar's a familiar spot for Will Haven, the Sacramento noise-metal band with a particularly strong following in Europe.It's where the group recorded its 1997 debut album, ""El Diablo,"" as well as ""WHVN,"" the group's second full-length album. (It also laid down the booming drum tracks for 2007's ""The Hierophant"" there).Released in 1999, ""WHVN"" helped cement Will Haven's fandom for intense, super-heavy metal. The popular hard rock magazine Kerrang! awarded four out of five ""K""s for ""WHVN,"" gushing that it was ""one of the best albums of the year so far.""Jeff Irwin, guitarist of Will Haven, credits the Hangar's relaxed vibe and amenities for burning off steam or boredom during long recording sessions. The Hangar's multiple skateboard ramps have always been a popular diversion for bands.""Guitars were always the last thing to record, so I'd skate the ramp all day and by the time it was my turn I'd be all sweaty and tired,"" said Irwin. ""We never felt trapped inside. We were always just stoked to be in the building.""""Listening Game"" Far (1992)Long before ""emo"" bands reached the mainstream and sold millions of albums, Sacramento's Far mined this sound. The group recorded all of its first demos at Enharmonik/the Hangar, honing its blend of confessional lyrics and melodic guitar blast. This was also the location where Far recorded a cover of Jawbox's ""Savory"" with Chino Moreno of Deftones, in 1997.""Listening Game"" from 1992 marked the first full album from this pivotal Sacramento band, which later signed to Epic/Immortal Records and scored radio play with the single ""Mother Mary."" It captures an especially youthful Far, loud and impassioned. Far's largely been on hiatus since 1999  but listen to bands such as Jimmy Eat World and you'll hear Far's influence.""Looking back, that was a growth record that was really fun,"" said Jonah Matranga, Far's frontman. ""(This studio) played a big part. It was a pro recording studio but it didn't feel sterile. It was a cool environment to be in."""\u000a

Hes shifted it from a major effort in the summer and fall to pulling back as oil residue washing ashore has diminished each month since the winter.Utsler told the Sun Herald on Thursday the last of the focus for cleanup is 550 acres of marsh in Louisiana and the barrier islands, which include the Gulf Islands National Seashore off the Mississippi Coast.Bird-nesting season poses a problem in both those areas, and their sensitive marsh grasses can be damaged by foot traffic.Also a cleanup problem is thick tar mats off the shore of the barrier islands from Florida to Alabama. Twenty to 100 feet in length, the mats rest on the near-shore bottoms, but theyre too far out to reach from shore.Utsler estimates 30 have been identified and documented.

V"Sacramento County paid $10.6 million in the last fiscal year to handle injury claims, an 18 percent increase over the previous year, according to a report presented to supervisors Tuesday morning.A major reason for the increase was higher legal fees and costs, said Randy Rendig of the George Hills Co., which manages the county's claims program. A claim is an administrative action that precedes the filing of a lawsuit.Legal fees and costs increased 50 percent to $5 million in the fiscal year ending July 1, 2012.The Sheriff's Department accounted for the most lawsuits in the county, with 39 percent. Nine of those cases alleged excessive force while another seven cases claimed civil rights violations.The county paid $4.8 million to resolve claims, a 3 percent increase over the previous year."\u000a

He was sentenced Friday by Yolo County Superior Court Judge Stephen Mock.Chaney had been employed as chief financial officer for Harper Model Home Maintenance, a company owned by his former mother-in-law and father-in-law. Between 2003 and 2007, he embezzled more than $300,000 from his employer by paying his personal expenses with corporate funds and altering the records to cover the fraud, officials said.Chaney made unauthorized purchases for gifts, child-support payments, computers, furniture, appliances, mortgage payments and to buy assets for a competing business he intended to start.Chaney, who already had a six-figure salary, also failed to claim the income on his tax returns for 2006 and 2007, giving rise to tax liability, according to the news release.Mock ordered Chaney to pay more than $340,000 in restitution to his former employer and more than $67,000 to the state, representing the unpaid tax, penalties, interest and the cost of the tax investigation.The judge also sentenced Chaney's wife, Kara Brown, to three years of felony probation for acting as an accessory to her husband's thefts."\u000a

V"My husband and I recently rented a car via AutoEurope for a trip to Germany and the Czech Republic. We received a prepaid voucher for a rental from Hertz.When we landed in Munich, Germany, a Hertz representative told us our reservation had been canceled. After some delay, checking on his computer and his garage, he assured us that we could obtain another, smaller car. He said it would cost slightly less than our original rental amount, but that we would have to take up the refund of the original reservation with Auto Europe.My husband signed a new charge slip (of course, all in German) and we were glad to finally be on our way. The Hertz agent gave us a credit card receipt, but no rental agreement.While still in Europe, my husband sent an email to AutoEurope, letting it know about the cancellation. We returned the car without incident.Now both Hertz and AutoEurope are charging us for the car. After several months of multiple emails and phone calls, AutoEurope advised us that its original charge indeed was for our reservation, which it states was not canceled, and that the Hertz charges were not for a new rental but for unrequested extra insurance, a car return relocation fee, entry to Czech Republic fee and a winterization fee.I am angry and offended by the dishonesty of the Hertz agent in Munich and the collusion of AutoEurope. Do we have any recourse?  Pat Shopher, El MaceroAutoEurope's voucher should have worked. But instead of taking the next rental, you should have contacted AutoEurope immediately and asked it to fix the problem with Hertz. That way, this misunderstanding could have been avoided.I've dealt with a few cases like this, in which reservations for inter- national rentals were canceled and then rebooked at a higher rate. Usually, customers end up with an extra fee or two, but I've never seen it rise to this level.Some of the fees charged by the Hertz location in Germany seem suspicious. If you never asked for insurance, why should you pay for it? A winterization fee? (That would be for winter tires, which should come standard with any car driving in winter conditions.) Why did you sign a contract you couldn't understand? You have the right to ask for a contract in a language you understand, or at least for a translation.Instead, it looks as if you assumed the terms of your rental were the same as for the AutoEurope rental, and they weren't.The vouchers issued by a company like AutoEurope should include all mandatory charges, and if Hertz had accepted it, you probably wouldn't have had any surprises on your credit card bill. You made a valiant attempt to dispute this with each company, short of taking this matter up with your credit card.Fortunately, that wasn't necessary. I contacted Hertz on your behalf. It refunded 251 euros, the full amount of Hertz's optional services."\u000a

V"Shpritz Anthony, a beloved member of the Sacramento theater community, passed away unexpectedly Jan. 5 at his Sacramento home at the age of 47. The cause of death has not been determined.Mr. Anthony was a fixture at Sacramento Theatre Company for more than 20 years, starting there as an intern and working his way up to general manager. Along the way, Mr. Anthony worked in the box office, as assistant stage manager, stage manager, company manager and director of operations. He left STC in the fall of 2010 to become director of operations of the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists.Mr. Anthony also worked for California Musical Theatre as Music Circus operations manager from 2004 through the 2010 season. ""Shpritz collaborated closely with our company while wearing multiple hats at STC,"" said Scott Klier, CMT associate producer. ""He played an instrumental role through the Pavilion's construction process and STC's renovation. ""News of his passing has not only devastated our local theater community, but has also been met by an outpouring of love and sympathy from hundreds of Music Circus veteran actors and artisans from throughout the country. He was an original, he was family, and he will be deeply missed,"" Klier said.Mr. Anthony was known for his nurturing generosity, gracious positive energy and a distinctive infectious laugh.Dawn Benton, executive vice president and CEO of the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists, said Mr. Anthony took treatment of their members to an all-time high.""Everyone has their off days but Shpritz always made the members his No. 1 priority, and the staff here too. He was a real mother hen,"" Benton said.At STC Mr. Anthony worked for six artistic directors, including Mark Cuddy, who nurtured him. Mr. Anthony blossomed under Peggy Shannon, who led STC from June 1998 through June 2010.""He stage-managed things for me in Los Angeles and assisted with casting that I did in both Los Angeles and in New York,"" Shannon said. She met Mr. Anthony when he picked her up at the airport as she came to Sacramento as a guest director.""Shpritz was amazing, made me feel at home, took care of everything to ensure I was comfortable,"" Shannon said. After several more trips to Sacramento, Shannon became the STC artistic director, with Mr. Anthony as her right-hand man. ""We decided that he and I were meant to be brother and sister, "" Shannon said. ""We began to publicly claim this relationship."" Shannon was a single parent with two young children at the time. ""Every Saturday morning he would arrive at my home in Sacramento to pick up Isaiah (her son) and eventually Aliyah (her daughter) and take them to a movie, to the mall, to the pumpkin patch, to his house, for a drive, to the park, you name it,"" Shannon said. ""He did this every Saturday, rain or shine, for roughly seven years.""Diana Gutierrez described her brother as a ""very giving, loving person.""""He was always positive,"" she said. ""He always thought the glass was half full.""He introduced me to theater and taught me to love it the way he did. 'Les Misrables' was his favorite show, and we went to see it four times together. He gave his life to theater.""David Shpritz Anthony Born: Dec. 12, 1965 Died: Jan. 5, 2013 Survived by: Father, Ernie Castellano; and sisters, Stephanie Aldama, Diana Gutierrez and Melody Spicer, all of Campbell.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/01/07/5097858/stoppage-time-ronaldo-is-a-bridesmaid.html,"Over the past four years, Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo has become very familiar with the phrase ""Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.""The Portuguese superstar is undoubtedly one of the best players of his generation, yet for the fourth successive year, Ronaldo has been in attendance as the name of Lionel Messi has been called to receive the FIFA Ballon d'Or, given annually to the world's best player.For four straight years, Ronaldo has had to grit his teeth and politely applaud while Messi receives yet another accolade which Ronaldo feels should rightfully be his.""People either love me or hate me,"" Ronaldo said ahead of Monday's announcement. ""Not even God is capable of pleasing everyone. This is part of my journey, part of my personality. I will try to make it so that the majority of people like me.""What Ronaldo is apparently missing is that the FIFA Ballon d'Or (formerly known as the FIFA World Player of the Year) is not a popularity contest, but rather a recognition of achievement on the playing field.And in 2012, it was hard to argue that Messi once again separated himself from the pack, bagging a record 91 goals in the calendar year to eclipse the mark of 85 set by Bayern Munich and Germany legend Gerd Muller 40 years ago.Yet for all the individual brilliance of Messi in 2012, it was not a banner year for his Barcelona team as the club was overtaken in La Liga by Ronaldo's Real Madrid, while Barca was bounced from the Champions League in the semifinal round by Chelsea.Ronaldo scored 46 goals to lead his team to the league title, and had the opportunity to add the Champions League crown to his resume, which would have been a major boost to his claim as world's best player.However, with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich headed to penalty kicks after a 3-3 aggregate score in their semifinal meeting, Ronaldo failed to convert Real's first attempt and Bayern defeated the Spanish side, 3-1, in the shootout.Had Real advance to the final, the club would have been a big favorite over a suspension-riddled Chelsea side, but that was only the first big opportunity missed.The second came this past summer at Euro 2012 with Portugal.Messi had no major competitions this past year with Argentina, so leading Portugal to glory at the European Championship would have been a major feather in the cap of Ronaldo, who was serving as captain of the team.But after scoring three goals to help Portugal reach the semifinals against Spain, Ronaldo's team once again fell a little short, and once again it was decided by penalty kicks.Only this time Ronaldo took no part in the 4-2 shootout defeat as he was presumably the fifth player on Portugal's list, which begs the question as to why he wasn't moved up further.Ronaldo has been to the top of the mountain before when he led Manchester United to both the Premiership title and Champions League crown in 2008 while being named the FIFA World Player of the Year.But since that time, Messi has been the driving force behind a historic run of success for Barcelona and has put up mind-boggling numbers which stand out just a little more than the impressive displays of Ronaldo.Off the field, Messi has exhibited nothing but a humble public demeanor, which is in stark contrast to the ultra-confident almost defiant nature of his Portuguese counterpart, who apparently views Messi's attitude as a sign of weakness.""Too much humility is a defect,"" said Ronaldo in an apparent shot at Messi. ""This is how I am.""No Cristiano, Messi's humility is actually refreshing in an age of me-first athletes, while your petulance is yet another example of an all-too-familiar trend.And Messi already has a big edge in the running for the 2013 award with Barcelona holding an almost insurmountable lead in La Liga, while Real Madrid has the difficult task of facing Manchester United in the Champions League round of 16.An early exit at the hands of United and a distant second-place finish in the league will hardly help Ronaldo's bid as he attempts to wrestle the title of world's best player away from Messi.In 2012, Ronaldo came up just a little short when it mattered most.Sadly for him, it is a theme that has become very familiar."\u000a

V"Fifty years ago, Folsom High School finished its football season 9-0 and ranked No. 1 in Northern California.Four years later, in 1966, a small Catholic school was built amid the walnut orchards of Contra Costa County in Concord. The founding principal of De La Salle was Norman Cook, a man with deep Sacramento roots. It took Cook six years to start a football program at De La Salle, best known in its formative years for academics, the drama club and the occasional nationally ranked distance runner.Tonight at Sacramento State, Folsom plays De La Salle to decide the Northern California Open champion in a game no one would have envisioned in the otherwise free-thinking 1960s. Now Folsom has a shot to regain its status as No. 1 in Northern California against a program that has become perhaps the greatest football dynasty in national high school history.Cook told me years before he died in 2003 that establishing football at De La Salle ""was my greatest challenge."" His push for football met resistance because the sport was deemed a distraction to academics. Cook argued that athletics enriched his life when he played sports at Christian Brothers in the mid-1940s, and he encouraged athletics when he was the vice principal at CBS in the late 1950s.As De La Salle's principal, Cook toured middle schools to gauge interest, and students told him they wanted to play high school football. Cook wrote letters to the regional school district and to his bosses seeking permission to start a program. He later said he ""begged and BS'd my way"" and got his wish when football was approved in 1971.Ed Hall, a San Francisco police officer, sought out Cook at a school function and volunteered to lead the Spartans' early teams. Cook lacked one valuable resource  money.""Since there was no budget for football, Brother Norman searched for sources of funding but found few,"" said Pat O'Brien, a longtime Cook friend who coached and taught at CBS. ""Finally, he called a hotel-restaurant owner, a golfer friend of Joe DiMaggio, and this gentleman, Syl Enea, picked up the tab for football. Hard to believe, but that's history.""Hall was known to track down players on the golf course who skipped summer three-a-day workouts and bring them back to the blocking sleds. But he quit in frustration after seven years without one winning season.Hall's replacement was Bob Ladouceur, a 24-year-old with no head-coaching experience. That was 1979; it also was the last time a Sacramento-area school, Cordova, finished No. 1 in Northern California.Now De La Salle is the most recognized and decorated football program in the state.Cook, who left De La Salle in 1973, experienced the pride in the program when he returned to the school in the early 1990s to work as an administrative adviser.In a conversation in 1997, Cook said, ""Who would've guessed that a small school like De La Salle could become so big in football? If we hadn't written letters to beg for the creation of football, who knows what would've happened."""\u000a

V"More than 60 years after Sutter's Fort became part of the California parks system, you would think the city and county of Sacramento would know who the owner is.Guess again.Sacramento County assessment rolls originally listed the city as owner of the historic midtown property, a mistake that wasn't corrected until a couple of years ago.The mistake didn't cost any money until voters approved a statewide initiative allowing special districts to tax other governments. Then, the city wrongly paid taxes on the property for 10 years.The county has refunded some of that money, and for the last three years has been locked in a battle with the California Department of Parks and Recreation over payment of back taxes.The county went so far as to send the state a notice saying it was going to sell Sutter's Fort at a delinquent tax sale. The county backed off after learning state property can't be sold that way.The Department of Parks and Recreation has been the focus of scandal in the last year following revelations that parks officials were hiding millions of dollars in surplus funds at the same time they were moving to close parks because of a reported cash shortage.Now the department is arguing that it is not responsible for most of the delinquent taxes for Sutter's Fort.While governments aren't typically responsible for property taxes, they do have to pay levies from special districts since the passage of Proposition 218 in 1996.Two districts  the Midtown Sacramento Property Business Improvement District and the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency  receive taxes from Sutter's Fort. The county collects the taxes on their behalf.Leilani Yang, an attorney for the Department of Parks and Recreation, said the department has been willing to pay the flood control district levy, but not the business improvement tax. The state did not get to vote on the business improvement district and already receives the services it provides, she said.The district disagreed with the argument but agreed to a compromise: It would waive the back taxes if the parks department started paying the taxes this year. The state paid the district about $30,000 this year.The county at one point said the state owed $100,000 in back taxes, but has reduced the amount to $18,000, in large part because of the settlement with the midtown district.The state parks department also has disputed late fees assessed by the county. The state said it shouldn't have to pay the fees because the county didn't properly bill the state for the taxes.The county recently agreed to waive the fees and is awaiting payment of the back taxes.""When the bill was corrected in 2011, our office did not do what it was supposed to and notify the state,"" said Cynthia Gibbs, the county's assistant tax collector.The city of Sacramento informed county officials in 2010 that the city was mistakenly listed as the owner of Sutter's Fort, said Leyne Milstein, the city's finance director.Before then, she said, tax bills were paid by a variety of city departments; the mistake was discovered after the city decided to have all tax bills processed through her office, Milstein said.She said she did not know which office was previously responsible for the Sutter's Fort bill, nor why the city paid it for 10 years.The county refunded the city $26,500, for four years of payments, the most that could be refunded under state law, Gibbs said.Gibbs could not explain why the county originally listed Sutter's Fort as city property, nor could county Assessor Kathleen Kelleher, whose office originally made the mistake many years ago."\u000a

V"A 75-year anniversary celebration dinner and the first class of inductees into the McClatchy High School Athletic Hall of Fame will be held Sept. 20 at the Riverside Elks Lodge in Sacramento.The first group of inductees  48 athletes and two coaches  will come from those who competed in the school's first 25 years, from 1937 to 1962.The coaches are Jack Mauger, track, and George Bican, football.Among the individual inductees to be honored will be 1964 U.S. Olympic skier Starr Walton-Hurley; former NFL football player Gene Cronin; professional golfer Barbara Romack; Stanford and Sacramento Solons baseball player Roger Osenbaugh; and Cal track and football athlete John Pappa, who won the Sac-Joaquin Section sprint championships in 1948.Also to be honored will be the undefeated 1944 and 1947 McClatchy football teams; the 1951-1952 baseball teams that won 40 consecutive games; the league champion 1958 baseball team; and the Lions' section championship 1959 and 1960 cross country teams.About 360 people have made reservations to attend the sold-out event, says co-organizer Jim Coombs, including 92-year-old Morrison Bruner, a member of McClatchy's first graduating class.""McClatchy once produced some of the greatest athletes in Northern California,"" said Coombs, who grew up two blocks from the Freeport Boulevard campus where he graduated in 1957. He later taught and coached at the school. ""It was the Granite Bay, Rocklin and Del Oro of its day. As a kid, I grew up idolizing many of these athletes.""Coombs, a longtime basketball official, noted that during Bican's 25 years as McClatchy football coach, more than 100 of his players went on to compete in Division I college programs.Mauger, who started at McClatchy in 1937 and held the world record for left-handed pole vaulters for 26 years, went undefeated in dual track competitions from 1943 to 1949.Former McClatchy student Bob Sertich (1967), who initiated the Hall of Fame idea and founded the athletic support group Restore the Roar several years ago, is the co-organizer with Coombs.Joining them as selection committee members are former McClatchy athletic director Mike Nishio ('63), former faculty members Rod Hollander and Jan Olmsted and alumni Mike Ricci ('69) and Rod Kunisaki ('75).Hall of Fame inductees also will be honored at the Sept. 21 McClatchy football game against Valley at Hughes Stadium.

V"Sacramento County is spending $1.5 million to renovate its Community Development Department, with much of the money going to high-end furniture in its downtown Seventh Street offices.County officials say the work is necessary to improve service to developers, who have complained about a slow and inflexible permitting process.But with the county in its fifth straight year of budget cuts  cuts that have included laying off hundreds of planners and engineers  the project has prompted some questions.""I'm always concerned about the appearance of spending money like this,"" said Supervisor Phil Serna. ""But I understand the administration's reasons for doing it.""After taking office in 2011, County Executive Brad Hudson spent more than $21,000 on furniture and a shoeshine machine and $35,000 on sound-masking equipment for his office.He also pushed for the reorganization of the Community Development Department, a revamp that brought together planning and other services into one department, under his authority. He has made development a priority.County officials say they expect to spend about $360,000 on furniture for the renovation project. The first phase includes more than $200,000 in furnishings by Herman Miller, a company considered a pioneer in modern furniture design. The California Museum has an exhibit on one of the company's former designers, Ray Eames.""It is high-end furniture, but I don't understand why it's a problem  we use it throughout the county,"" said Jeff Gasaway, the county's facilities manager.The county is building a ""one-stop shop"" for developer services that will feature Herman Miller work stations and 23 of its Aeron stools and chairs.A New York Times writer called the Aeron the ""standard-issue luxury item for dot-com entrepreneurs at the height of the economic bubble of the 1990s.""Buying at discounted bulk rates, the county bought the stools for $880 each and the chairs for $630 each, records show.Lori Moss, director of the Community Development Department, said the county bought the chairs and stools to ensure employees are comfortable and because the county must make accommodations for the physical needs of some employees. The Aeron chairs and stools provide ergonomic features not found in most office furniture, she said.Herman Miller products last a long time, and the new purchases can be used with other Herman Miller furniture the county already owns, Moss and Gasaway said.The one-stop shop will bring together several different county services in one room, saving people from having to drive to different locations to get various permits, Moss said.""In the past, the county has had a stigma when it comes to efficiency,"" she said.A 2008 audit, conducted at the county's request, found that the departments serving the development community were full of ""silos, black holes and an out-of-date organizational culture.""Hudson used the audit as an argument for merging services under one Community Development Department. Since the consolidation, however, the department has continued to fall short of its goals.In the last fiscal year, for instance, the department completed applications within 60 days only 55 percent of the time. Moss said the renovation, which includes a change in layout for planning offices, will lead to improvement in that area."\u000a

V"An El Dorado Hills teen on a family outing died Sunday in a Sierra sledding accident.Dylan Ridolfi, 15, an offensive lineman on the unbeaten Oak Ridge High School freshman football team, was sledding with about 10 friends and family members at Mt. Rose on Sunday afternoon when the accident occurred.Football was a passion for the teen, who stood 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weighed 240 pounds. He also had a soft spot in his heart for kids, invariably being drawn to the smallest in the room at gatherings.""He was a big kid but he had a huge heart,"" said his father, Dan Ridolfi.His father said that his son was on an inner tube and had traveled a short distance up a hill when he began a sledding run. His father said the area was icy because of the lack of recent snow.Dylan Ridolfi lost control and hit a tree at the area known as Sheeps Flat in southern Washoe County, Nevada, near the Mt. Rose Highway.Grief counselors were at Oak Ridge High School on Tuesday. In addition, administrators were stopping in at the teen's classes to help any student having a hard time.""Football gave him structure and self-worth,"" his father said.His dream was to study engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno, the alma mater of his parents. The year the teen began to take to football coincided with Colin Kaepernick's senior year at UNR. He saw Kaepernick play several times.The family had spent the weekend staying at Incline Village, skiing on Saturday. On Sunday, they decided to go sledding at Mt. Rose.""It was very, very icy,"" said his father. ""He had gone up a hill. He had not gone more than 20 or 30 feet. He just picked up a head of steam and veered off the main area into a tree.""His father and others immediately started cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A fire truck happened to be near and fire personnel rendered aid soon after the accident.A helicopter ambulance arrived, but Dylan Ridolfi died on the mountain.""Dylan was one of those kids who got along with everybody,"" said his father. ""He always loved being around little kids. If there was a toddler in the room, he would be the one who would play with them and keep them happy.""He is survived by his father, mother Kristen Ridolfi, brother Andrew and sister Madison."\u000a

V"Jesse Phillips has coached high school football for only three seasons, and this was his first year as an assistant at Foothill.So when Mustangs head coach Scott Swartz resigned last weekend after four games to take a job in business in Utah, Phillips knew he needed to step up, despite his inexperience.He and Chris Johnson, another Foothill assistant, were named interim co-head coaches Thursday for an 0-4 Mustangs team still reeling from their leader's sudden departure.""We've just got to keep moving forward,"" said Phillips, a special-education teacher's aide at the Foothill Farms school. ""Because I know this area and what the kids go through in their lives  the people coming in and out of their lives  I knew I needed to continue to try to provide the proper direction. Since the summer, I watched many of them grow into young men.""Swartz, in his first season at Foothill, brought an impressive rsum and installed a sophisticated pro-set offense popular with the players.Swartz, 37, had been an assistant coach at San Jose State, Oregon State and Northern Arizona. He also had prepared film and scouting reports for then-49ers coach Dennis Erickson in 2004.Swartz was named the Stockton Record's 2008 Football Coach of the Year after guiding McNair to the playoffs for the first time but left when his teaching job was eliminated during a round of layoffs. Swartz, who has two daughters, was unable to land a physical education teaching job in the region.""It's not like we were 0-4 and I ran off,"" said Swartz, who was an off-campus coach at Foothill, which has undergone budget cutbacks of its own. ""I have to do this for my family.""Johnson and Phillips understand.""He's really a good guy,"" said Johnson, who is in his first year of coaching high school football and works for Verizon. ""I saw his true passion for the game, and I learned a lot from him. But in the end, he needed to make money for his family.""Junior tight end-defensive end David Entwistle knew something was up when Swartz didn't show up for two practices and the Mustangs' game against Rio Linda on Sept. 14.Still, Entwistle and the Mustangs were stunned when it was announced Monday that Swartz wasn't coming back.""It's not what any of us wanted, but it happened, and now we have to move forward,"" Entwistle said. ""I like coach Swartz, and I'm glad (the administration) didn't bring in a new coach from the outside. We have chemistry with these coaches.""But if all the coaches quit, we'd still have a team,"" Entwistle continued. ""We have a core group that's here for the long haul.""Foothill athletic director Bill Lum thinks the team is in good hands with Phillips and Johnson after seeing how they handled their leadership-under-fire roles against Rio Linda.""The good part of this, from what I've seen, is the kids are responding to them and respect them,"" Lum said.Foothill, which has a bye this weekend, plays at home next Friday against Natomas, which also was winless entering Friday's home game against Ponderosa."\u000a

V"Batch Data Processor","Marcus Crowder",http://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/04/4878739/sweet-hits-a-few-misses-in-cosmos.html,"The good news and not-so-good news about ""I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change"" is that it's a charming little musical idea. The four performers are easily likable, showing off terrific comic timing and fine voices for the serviceable tunes.There's plenty to like and even chuckle about in the thematically linked vignettes dealing with dating, romance and marriage. There's also enough to yawn about in the clich-ridden sketches, so that one wonders exactly how this show has become such a phenomenon.The musical written by Joe DiPietro and Jimmy Roberts had a New York production in which it ran from 1996 to 2008. Since then it's become a worldwide regional theater staple with productions in cities including London, Tel Aviv, Barcelona, Shanghai, Beijing and Tokyo. The songs have been translated into Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, Czech, Catalan, Finnish, Mandarin and Norwegian, so the material apparently speaks to people everywhere.The new Cosmopolitan Cabaret production is ably directed by Glenn Casale, with versatile actors Michael Dotson, Jerry Lee, Jennifer Malenke and Melissa WolfKlain popping in and out of the dozen-plus characters. The musical director and pianist is Graham Sobelman.Opening with ""Cantata for a First Date,"" the songs in the two-act production move through a rough trajectory of courtship that ends at a funeral parlor, where a widow and widower negotiate a reasonable friendship during a viewing. The sweet-natured ""I Can Live With That"" has all the best attributes of the show, with the affable Dotson and a wary WolfKlain each displaying enough vulnerability, longing and loyalty to their former spouses that the real story is told through the duration of the song, which has the most depth of anything in the show. That scene starkly contrasts with the first skit of the night in which the same two actors meet for an evening, which becomes the template for speed dating as they comically decide to theoretically skip through the ups and down of the superficial relationship they will never have. The beautifully voiced Lee gives an enchanting performance of ""Shouldn't I Be Less in Love With You?""Lee and Malenke also have a fine duet in ""A Stud and a Babe"" when their two rather nebbish characters realize they are not the stuff that erotic dreams are made of but have an attraction for each other just the same.Less successful are tunes such as ""Why? 'Cause I'm a Guy"" and ""The Baby Song."" The show works best when it's at its most generous, smiling at the difficulties of romance we all understand or gently acknowledging the compromises we make to live with someone else.I Love You, You're Perfect, Now ChangeThree starsWhat: The popular musical about romance takes its turn at the Cosmopolitan Cabaret.When: 7 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 2 p.m. Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, through Nov. 18.Where: The Cosmopolitan Cabaret, 1000 K St.Tickets: $20-$43.Information: (916) 557-1999, www.californiamusicaltheatre.com or Tickets.com, (800) 225-2277 Time: One hour and 50 minutes including oneintermission"\u000a

V"The Sheldon Huskies grew rather fond of Power Balance Pavilion the last few years, winning three consecutive Sac-Joaquin Section championships and adding a Northern California large-school championship in a historic effort last week with a spirited triumph over rival Jesuit.Saturday night, the Huskies couldn't wipe away the bitter taste of a bitter end to a sweet season, falling to national No. 3 Mater Dei of Santa Ana 66-48 in a CIF State Basketball Championship Division I final better suited for shoulder pads.Mirroring Sheldon's disgust in what was supposed to be a marquee moment to conclude the high school basketball season was the sight of hundreds of fans who shelled out a tidy $12 for parking and $16 per ticket filing out midway through the fourth quarter. The scene seemed to suggest the consumer didn't come to watch the referees work  and pile fouls onto both teams.The lone Sheldon starter left by the middle of the fourth quarter was point guard D'Erryl Williams.The rest of his starting mates had fouled out  Nate Iese late in the third with a referee chasing him to the bench yelling, ""Tuck your shirt in!""  and then forgetting to allow Sheldon the chance to put in a fresh player. Iese had 12 rebounds and six inside points against taller foes.Sheldon's national 6-foot-6 junior guard recruit, Dakarai Allen, fouled out on a questionable play under the basket that even had a Mater Dei official muttering, ""Wow, Sheldon should be mad."" Allen had five points on 2-of-12 shooting and six rebounds.With 5:19 left, senior Kyi Thomas (12 points) fouled out with his team down 53-40. Sheldon junior Ryan Manning fouled out with 3:36 to go with five points and a look of dejection.Perhaps the top athlete on the floor  Mater Dei's 6-7 forward Xavier Johnson  fouled out on a technical foul in the third quarter. He had seven points and six rebounds.The game was so erratic a crew of officials who worked the earlier contests and an evaluator nodded and frowned at what unfolded in front of them.Still, none of this could take away from the season Sheldon (29-6) produced or disguise the talent and skill of Mater Dei (34-2), which repeated as state champion for the program's record ninth state title.Katin Reinhardt, a 6-foot-4 guard headed to UNLV, scored 30 points, including a state-final-record six three-pointers. Stanley Johnson had 21 points and 11 rebounds.Mater Dei was the most complete team Sheldon had faced, able to score inside and outside, run and defend. The Monarchs led 21-18 after the first quarter and 33-27 at halftime before pulling away.Williams, a junior rock for Sheldon, played through a strained hamstring and couldn't attack as he has so frequently this season. He had 13 points. Still, the Huskies offered no excuses.""We couldn't control the referees, and they called what they saw,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said. ""We still played hard. D'Erryl playing hurt (was a factor). He couldn't attack, and as he goes, we go.""With the core group returning, Sheldon expects another title run  and it expects to grow from the experience.""It's something to build on,"" Rollings said.

V"WASHINGTON  A bipartisan effort to secure at least 80 percent of fines from the BP Gulf oil spill for the five Gulf Coast states  Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas  advanced Wednesday as the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved the bill by voice vote. Committee chairwoman Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., praised the lawmakers from both parties who had worked together to develop the RESTORE the Gulf Coast Act of 2011. It is an important commitment to the people of the Gulf, she said. The bill now goes to the full Senate. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., a member of the panel, said the lawmakers came together because the legislation would direct fines from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout to the hard-hit Gulf Coast. The fund could collect from $5 billion to $20 billion. That's where the damage happened, Vitter said. That's where the restoration has to occur. The legislation would establish a Gulf Coast Restoration Fund to provide Gulf Coast states with 80 percent of the Clean Water Act fines related to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill. The U.S. Treasury Department would receive the remaining 20 percent of the fines assessed against BP and other parties found to be responsible for the April 2010 tragedy. Under existing law, the Treasury would collect the entire amount. Under the bill, the states would equally divide 35 percent of the monies directed to the Gulf states. Sixty percent of the funds would be directed to the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5 percent would go to a new Gulf science and fisheries program.  The federal Clean Water Act allows the Environmental Protection Agency to impose a $1,100 fine for every barrel of oil spilled, which can rise to $4,300 per barrel. According to a statement issued by Republican Mississippi Sens. Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker, the estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico mean that BP could face fines between $5.4 billion and $21.1 billion. By directing BP penalty money back to the states that are dealing with the cleanup and restoration from this devastating spill, we help ensure that the Gulf Coast continues to thrive for decades to come, said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. This legislation was carefully crafted to give Gulf Coast states the resources and flexibility they need to confront the long-term consequences of the oil spill, Cochran said. The Environment and Public Works Committee's endorsement should help propel the bill to the Senate floor for debate and passage. Both Cochran and Wicker worked on the bill, introduced in July, and are original co-sponsors.  In the House of Representatives, Rep. Steven Palazzo, R-Miss., said the Gulf Coast delegation is nearing a consensus on legislation there.  I will continue to work with members across the Gulf Coast to expeditiously introduce and pass a proposal that will provide the resources necessary to address the full economic and ecological restoration of coastal communities, Palazzo said.

V"The one thing Eddie Vanderdoes is most looking forward to now?A good night's sleep.Vanderdoes, the Placer High School senior defensive end and top-5 national recruit, ended months of speculation Wednesday when he announced he will attend Notre Dame on a football scholarship.Vanderdoes picked the Fighting Irish over UCLA, Washington, USC and national champion Alabama.It was a ""life decision,"" Vanderdoes said with a sense of relief that the decision was finally behind him.He first cited academics, then football tradition in South Bend, Ind., and the community that lives for its sports stars. ""Very happy about it,"" Vanderdoes said during a ceremony in front of media, family, friends and classmates in the auditorium on the Auburn campus. ""I'm finally done with the process. It feels like the right spot. It really fits.""Vanderdoes said he had lost sleep and agonized over his choice. Every school, he said, had merit. The recruiting process included rumors and speculation about which college Vanderdoes would select.One Internet report Wednesday had Vanderdoes headed to Auburn (in Alabama), but the confusion came because of his love for his foothill hometown. Earlier in the day, Notre Dame jumped the gun, including Vanderdoes on its signing list, even though he had not faxed his national letter of intent. Notre Dame quickly admitted its error and sent out a revised news release without Vanderdoes' name.Vanderdoes, who fielded dozens of calls from recruiters Wednesday, signed his paper and faxed it just moments before his announcement. ""He's a great player with a great future,"" said Jon Osterhout, who runs the linemen camp Linemen Win Games and is close with the Vanderdoes family. ""He couldn't go wrong with any of his choices. This decision will affect him for the next 70 years. The next big decision for him may be picking his future wife.""Said Vanderdoes when told of the quote: ""I don't have a wife  this year.""Vanderdoes led a strong recruiting class for the region.At the same ceremony in the Placer auditorium, golfer Hannah Gregg signed with Sonoma State, tight end Stone Sander signed with Sacramento State and quarterback Peter Denham with Northern Arizona.Many other area schools held signing parties. At Antelope, three football players became the first Titans to sign Division I letters. Receiver Tyler Winston and lineman Michael Okoroike are headed to San Jose State, and lineman Daren Echeveria is off to Air Force.""We appreciate and understand how hard this is to get a scholarship,"" Okoroike said. ""I feel great about it. It's a chance to get a free education and still play football.""Okoroike, who said he dreams of becoming a surgeon, joked that linemen often wind up with mangled fingers  not good for surgeons  but vowed to play smart.Winston had interest from other programs such as UCLA but said he felt at home with San Jose State, which won 11 games this season, the most victories since 1940.""I think we have a really good recruiting class,"" Winston said. ""And I'm glad it's over. It's a relief. I'm proud.""Among other top players signing Wednesday were Pleasant Grove running back Isaiah Saunders (Idaho) and defensive tackle Nick Terry (Boise State).Boise State also landed Nevada Union linebacker Tanner Vallejo and Jesuit wide receiver Thomas Sperbeck.Grant receiver Trayvon Henderson signed with Hawaii in what national recruiting experts viewed as a steal.There was even a signing in Florida.The Bee Player of the Year, Del Oro's Brandon Monroe, in Orlando for an all-star football showcase, signed with San Jose State to play running back or defensive back.""I think he'd be a really good college back,"" Del Oro coach Casey Taylor said. ""He has great lateral quickness and speed."""\u000a

James scored and was fouled.James missed her free-throw attempt but scrambled for the loose ball, which found its way to Lee. She hit a cutting Alaina Paaga with another perfect pass for a layup with 17 seconds left.A desperation McClatchy three-point attempt for the tie from well above the key missed just before the buzzer.""All I know is that I didn't want this to end,"" said Lee, who scored a game-high 17 points despite limping noticeably from a bad back. ""Me and Dejza have been playing since third grade, and we know that as seniors we're expected to carry the team on our shoulders.""James, despite constant double and triple teams, scored 13 points.""They've been playing together so long that it shows on the court,"" said Pleasant Grove coach James McKeever. ""They've really taken charge of developing the younger girls. They're not only good basketball players, they're just great all-around kids.""Freshman Brittany Nguyen scored nine points for the Eagles, all on first-half three-pointers, and Paaga had three big fourth-quarter layups after replacing starting post Aaliyah Pena, who fouled out with 3:19 to play.Impressive 6-foot-2 freshman post Gigi Garcia led McClatchy with 17 points; senior Aleea Reese scored 15 points, and sophomore Lauren Nubla eight points and countless hustle plays at both ends.The Lions played without leading scorer Destiney Lee, a 6-2 sophomore, sidelined with an ankle injury."\u000a

V"A year ago in Grass Valley, the emotions stirred for myriad reasons.Elk Grove High School football coach Chris Nixon winced before kickoff when the public address announcer declared the return of a Nixon, a former Miner and the son of the ""late Nevada Union coach Marshall Nixon.""The ""late"" mention was a bit premature, to be sure, coach Nixon cracked this week.""Gave me a scare, and I looked into the stands and dad was still there, so all was good,"" Nixon said.All was grand Friday, too.A year after a milestone moment at NU, the top-ranked Thundering Herd literally sprinted to a 43-19 victory over the No. 3 Miners in a nonleague contest of decades-old wing-T rivals.The Herd prevailed in its finest showing of the young season on the strength of a spectacular 303-yard, three touchdown effort by halfback Robert Frazier and a defense that yielded just six second-half points.And yes, the old man was there, too, alive and well. Marshall Nixon was tickled at the view of his son's team storming to a 5-0 mark in the program's first home game of the season.Last year's 23-7 win at NU was part of a 12-1 Thundering Herd campaign. A repeat showing, if not a bit more? That's the goal, certainly.""That game last year was the statement game for our team,"" coach Nixon said. ""You have to beat NU before getting labeled legit.""Elk Grove, ranked No. 1 in the Sac-Joaquin Section and No. 2 in Northern California by MaxPreps.com, is fueled by superb interior blocking with an offensive line that proudly goes by ""The Hammerheads.""Elk Grove countered NU's passing attack of Kyle Cota with two swift runners and that attacking defense.Cota had touchdown passes of 33 and 10 yards to Austin Marks and Ian Davis, respectively, for a 13-6 lead. It was pretty much all Herd from there.Frazier ripped off scoring runs of 44, 77 and 57 yards in an impressive show of his burst. Backfield mate Wadus Parker returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown and ended the scoring with a 59-yard scoring run in finishing with 108 rushing yards. Parker was ribbed by Nixon for redeeming himself. Parker's late fumble at NU last year resulted in the Miners' only score.""This could be one of the best teams Elk Grove has ever had, and right now, they look like as good a team as they've had,"" said Nevada Union coach Dave Humphers, whose team is 3-2. ""They have a terrific set of running backs, and they're quick and athletic on defense.""I'm really happy for Chris Nixon and his success.""Humphers showed terrific class, hustling across the field to pat an injured Elk Grove player on the shoulder pads with just over three minutes left and the game in hand, and then he shook Nixon's hand."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/04/20/4428221/not-quite-a-teen-yet-sold-for.html,"If you think sex trafficking only happens in faraway places like Nepal or Thailand, then you should listen to an expert on American sex trafficking I interviewed the other day. But, first, wish her happy birthday. She turned 16 years old on Thursday. She asked me to call her Brianna in this column because she worries that it could impede her plans to become a lawyer if I use her real name. Brianna, who grew up in New York City, is smart, poised and enjoys writing poetry. One evening when she was 12 years old she got into a fight with her mom and ran out to join friends. ""I didn't want to go home, because I thought I'd get in trouble,"" she said, and a friend's older brother told her she could stay at his place. Brianna figured that she would go home in the morning  and that that would teach her mom a lesson. But when morning arrived, her new life began. ""I tried to leave, and he said, 'You can't go; you're mine,' "" Brianna recalled. He told her that he was a pimp and that she was now his property. The pimp locked her in the room, she recalled, and alternately beat her and showed her affection. She says that he advertised her on Backpage.com, the leading website for sex trafficking in America today, as well as on other websites. ""He felt that Backpage made him the most money,"" Brianna said, estimating that half of her pimp's business came through Backpage. Backpage accounts for about 70 percent of America's prostitution ads (many placed by consenting adults who are not trafficked), according to AIM Group, a trade organization. Backpage cooperates with police and tries to screen out ads for underage girls, but that didn't help Brianna. Backpage is owned by Village Voice Media, and significant minority stakes have been held in recent years by Goldman Sachs and smaller financial firms such as Trimaran Capital Partners and Alta Communications. My research shows that representatives of Goldman, Trimaran and Alta, along with a founder of Brynwood Partners, all sat on the board of Village Voice Media, and there's no indication that they ever protested its business aims. When I wrote recently about this, these firms erupted in excuses and self-pity, and in some cases raced to liquidate their stakes. I was struck by the self-absorption and narcissism of Wall Street bankers viewing themselves as victims, so maybe it's useful to hear from girls who were victimized through the company they invested in. I met Brianna at Gateways, a treatment center for girls who have been sexually trafficked. It's in Pleasantville, N.Y., 35 miles north of New York City, on a sprawling estate overseen by the Jewish Child Care Association. Gateways is meant for girls 12 to 16, although it has accepted one who was just 11 years old. Virtually all the girls have been sold on Backpage, according to Lashauna Cutts, the center's director. Gateways has only 13 beds, and Cutts says that the need is so great that she could easily fill 1,300. ""I have to turn away girls almost every day,"" Cutts told me. The public sometimes assumes that teenage girls in the sex trade are working freely, without coercion. It's true that most aren't physically imprisoned by pimps, but threats and violence are routine. The girls typically explain that they didn't try to escape because of a complex web of emotions, including fear of the pimp but also a deluded affection and a measure of Stockholm syndrome. Once, Brianna says, she looked out her window  and there was her mother on the street, crying and posting ""missing"" posters with Brianna's photo.""I tried to shout to her through the window,"" she remembered. But her pimp grabbed her by the hair and yanked her back. ""If you shout, I'll kill you,"" she remembers him saying. ""If I tried to run, I thought he might kill me, or I'd be hurt,"" she said. ""And, if I went to the cops, I thought I'd be the one in trouble. I'd go to jail."" Pimps warn girls to distrust the police, and often they're right. Bridgette Carr, who runs a human-trafficking clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, tells of a 16-year-old girl who went missing. A family member found a photo of the girl on Backpage and alerted authorities. Police raided the pimp's motel room and ""rescued"" the girl  by handcuffing her and detaining her for three weeks. That mindset has to change. Police and prosecutors must target pimps and johns, not teen victims. Trafficked girls deserve shelters, not jails, and online emporiums like Backpage should stop abetting pimps. Sex trafficking is just as unacceptable in America as in Thailand or Nepal. And let's all wish our expert, Brianna, a joyous ""Sweet 16"" birthday!"\u000a

V"Several hundred people gathered Saturday in Capitol Park in one of 120 Day of Resistance rallies nationwide seeking to intensify support for the right to bear arms.The afternoon rally, where fluttering ""Don't Tread on Me"" flags were a common sight, saw speakers staunchly opposing some recent gun control proposals.The nationwide rallies were organized against a backdrop of gun control appeals in the wake of the mass killing of 20 schoolchildren and six adults in December by a lone gunman in Newtown, Conn.National polls have shown that a majority of Americans support some kinds of stricter gun controls, including on assault weapons like the one used in Newtown.Closer to home, the issue saw its latest evolution with a recent statewide ban on the open carrying of unloaded rifles on city streets. That law, which has exceptions, went into effect Jan. 1.The issues brought many to the Sacramento rally from afar, including Brendan O'Neill of Merced, who said, ""I came here to support our Second Amendment rights, because they're being whittled away, like our rights to open carry.""A series of speakers took turns opposing some gun-related laws and proposals, while showing support for others.One touted was Assembly Bill 202, by state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, which he recently introduced in the Legislature. The bill would allow teachers to carry concealed weapons on school grounds.""This will create an invisible line of defense around our children,"" said Christina Marotti, a Donnelly fundraiser and Sacramento parent who spoke at the rally. ""Our kids are sitting ducks at our schools and we have to do something about that.""For some at the rally, the gun issue has simmered across generations and nations, as it has for Redwood City resident Lois Garcia, who is of Cuban descent.""I came here because it's about freedom,"" Garcia said. ""One of the first things that Castro did when he took over in Cuba was, he went to people's homes and disarmed them.

But there's an interesting thing about this fraternity.They stick together amid crisis.This region has experienced its share of high school player and coaching deaths through the years. It never gets easier. The healing generally includes support beyond the immediate inner circle with football games serving as a diversion and a cause.In the early 1990s, Nevada Union and Grass Valley were rocked when two players were killed in a car accident. Football kept everyone together. The Miners won a Sac-Joaquin Section title in 1994 in honor of those players.Nevada Union coach Dave Humphers remembers. He said no amount of training prepares a coach suddenly confronted with a tragedy.In the wake of a Grant assistant football coach's apparent murder-suicide last weekend, Humphers reached out to his rival coach. Humphers and Grant coach Mike Alberghini haven't always been the chummiest of pals through the decades, but a tragedy can quickly alter that, Humphers said.""I called Mike because it was the human thing to do,"" Humphers said. ""So many of us have lost a player or a coach that was close to us. I told Mike, 'Those kids always need you, but they need you more than ever.' Football is a brotherhood, and sometimes that bond, that need to be together, really stands out in a time like this.""Humphers reminded that high school football players  all teenagers  are susceptible to real-life issues. The city, the suburbs, the foothills.Doesn't matter, he said. They need each other just as much.""There are kids everywhere who are hurting  a fight with a parent, no food at home, losing a loved one  and maybe the only positive thing in their life is time with their coaches and teammates,"" Humphers said. ""Sometimes players just need some love, to feel, 'Hey, I'm somebody important, at least to my coach and teammates.' And that's really true during hard times.""Del Oro coach Casey Taylor spoke at length with his old friend Alberghini this week by phone. The teams played a nonleague game Friday night at Grant. Normally the coaches would meet hours before kickoff to rib each other and downplay their seasons. This time they embraced.Del Oro has lost student-athletes in car wrecks and used sports to cope.As Grant and Del Oro played, Rio Linda took the field against Center. Rio Linda coach Mike Morris had his players wear Grant helmet stickers ""in support of our Grant cousins.""Oak Ridge coach Eric Cavaliere said his team was jolted this summer when a popular classmate committed suicide. Coming up short on a goal-line stand suddenly seems so meaningless, Cavaliere said.""He was so close to so many of our players  very difficult,"" Cavaliere said.

There is no secret,"" Ward told the crowd, noting that the key to weight loss is exercise. ""Small manageable changes can yield big results.""The 5-foot-10-inch Ward weighed 261 pounds when she started a weight-loss regimen on ""Biggest Loser.""

Haley Barbour said in a recent nationally-televised interview he hopes the budget cuts go forward to help reduce the deficit.Barbour, who left office in January 2012 after two terms, is a former national Republican Party chairman and a regular on cable news political shows. He appeared last week on Fox Business Network in an interview with Neil Cavuto.""I hope and believe that Republicans will allow the sequestration to go into effect so that we can start down a path of trying to get control of spending and reduce the deficit by savings,"" Barbour said. ""Because I'm like most Americans -- I don't think we have a trillion (dollars) plus deficit every year because we tax too little. It's because we spend too much.""President Barack Obama's office on Sunday released a long list of cuts each state would face under sequestration. Mississippi would face tens of millions of dollars in cuts, including 9,000 civilian Department of Defense employees in the state being furloughed, reducing total gross pay by around $49.9 million. Local military bases have said they rely heavily on civilian employees and most services will be affected by the furloughs. They said the cuts also affect readiness. There would also be cuts to education programs, environmental funds and money for job search assistance, among others.Barbour said in the interview he believes the nation can handle the cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011, which would become automatic Friday if a deal isn't struck to avert it.""We're talking about a tiny, tiny fraction of the federal budget... "" Barbour told Cavuto. ""The American people know the government can save 3 percent in a heartbeat.""But he didn't speak in only glowing terms. He said what's wrong with sequestration is the method with which it will be done.""We've already voted to cut defense spending nearly $500 billion over 10 years and here's another cut almost that large,"" Barbour said.

V"Our Region>Top Stories>Wire Nation/World>Gulf Oil Spill",http://www.sacbee.com/2011/06/02/3673164/oil-spill-was-economic-not-ecological.html,"WASHINGTON  Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour came to the U.S. Capitol on Thursday with a message: last summer's Gulf of Mexico oil spill was an economic  not an environmental  disaster, and he wants lawmakers to help shore up the region's hard-hit fishing, tourism and energy sectors. Barbour asked Congress to direct funds collected from Clean Water Act fines to the five Gulf states: Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Texas. Barbour testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the impact of last year's BP oil spill. The hearing was about the impact of the Obama administration's offshore oil drilling moratorium. The panel's Republicans and Democrats sparred over a report produced by the GOP majority critical of the Obama administration's handling of the oil spill. The committee's ranking Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, complaining that Democrats had been shut out of the writing of the report. Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said that Democrats could comment before the findings are published as a committee report. The GOP version, distributed to the press, was critical of all aspects of the administration's response to the spill, including ongoing concerns that the BP Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is stripping victims of their rights.  Asked about BP's compensation fund by Issa, which is being administered by BP agent Kenneth Feinberg, Barbour said, I think they're trying to do a good job. It's sure better than having to litigate all this.  But Barbour spent more time talking about the BP oil spill's impact on commercial and recreational fishing and blaming the media for sensationalizing the spill's impact on the beaches and environment of the Magnolia State. For us, this turned out to be primarily an economic disaster, said Barbour, who noted that the spill was 108 miles from Gulfport. It may develop that it's ecologically dangerous, but thus far  and we're different from Louisiana  it has been very manageable. The media coverage of the BP spill, said Barbour, gave the impression that the whole Gulf Coast was covered in oil. Our tourism industry was clobbered, he said, adding that though President Barack Obama's visit to the coast and to neighboring states helped, it was one news day. Barbour said the seafood industry had huge losses and the processors were slammed. He said that lawmakers should move on legislation to return the Clean Water Act fines to the states hit by the oil spill.  Issa was critical of the drilling moratorium, which was lifted in October, and stressed that the administration has been slow in approving permits. The moratorium hurt us financially, Barbour said. More importantly, it hurt the country.

V"WASHINGTON  Members of the House of Representatives from the five Gulf Coast states  Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Texas  announced Wednesday that they had agreed on a bill to direct at least 80 percent of the fines that BP is expected to pay for last year's oil spill to their states for economic and environmental restoration  a payday that may reach $20 million. Gulf Coast House members introduced the Restore the Gulf Coast Act on Wednesday and told reporters at a news conference on the U.S. Capitol grounds that the coast needs the funds, which under the Clean Water Act would otherwise go to the federal government. We need to make sure we do everything possible to restore our ecosystem and our economies to the way they were before, said Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. It's only fair that the lion's share of that money stays on the Gulf Coast. Scalise stressed that having all the affected states stand together in a united front with members from both parties will help move the legislation. There are several Democrats who are co-sponsoring the bill, including Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. A similar Senate bill already has cleared committee. Full recovery begins at the local level by meeting community needs, said Rep. Steven Palazzo, R-Miss. We've worked together as a coastal delegation to build consensus to best address the full economic and ecological restoration of coastal communities. The April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 men on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico and led to the loss of approximately 5 million barrels of crude oil before the well was capped in July 2010. More than a year after Deepwater Horizon turned our area upside down, the Gulf Coast is still recovering from the environmental, economic and emotional scars of this disaster, said Rep. Jo Bonner, R-Ala. We are here because we love the Gulf Coast. It's who we are. Florida, which did not suffer as much environmental damage as Louisiana, was interested in being able to use funds for economic impacts from the spill.  The House bill provides the necessary flexibility to allow states to meet their needs in responding to the oil spill's catastrophic effects, said Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla. And Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, added, This common-sense measure simply ensures that the areas that were impacted the most by the Deepwater Horizon incident have an opportunity to fully recover from this tragedy. The bill would equally divide 35 percent of the monies to the five states under a new Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund. Then, 60 percent of the funds would be distributed by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and 5 percent would go to a new Gulf science and fisheries program. The House bill does not include a small percentage to study oceans that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee added last month when it approved the bill. Scalise said that House leaders wanted Gulf lawmakers to come together before moving a bill.

V"John McDaniel remembers the standing-room-only crowds that packed the old Nevada Union High School girls gym more than two decades ago to watch Kellie Cook and the Lady Miners put on a show.""They had some amazing teams when I was there,"" said McDaniel, a 1993 graduate. ""They loved to run and gun and shoot three-pointers. The team was deep. They'd run line changes every three or four minutes and wear teams out.""From 1988 to 2000 under then-coach Craig Strohm, the Miners appeared in 10 Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship games, winning five times. The Cook-led Miners won three consecutive section titles from 1989 to 1991.McDaniel, who played boys basketball at Nevada Union, went on to college, became an engineer, worked in Seattle for several years before returning to Grass Valley a decade ago to become a teacher and coach at his alma mater.For six seasons, he's been trying to get the Miners girls back to their glory days.Nevada Union has taken a huge step this season.The No. 4 Miners are 20-4 and last Thursday ended No. 13 Del Oro's seven-year reign as Sierra Foothill League champions with a 70-67 victory in Grass Valley. It drew the same kind of big crowd (albeit in a larger, newer gym) McDaniel used to see as a student.But McDaniel's bunch is doing it in a different way.There is no superstar like Cook, who was inducted into the Sac-Joaquin Section Hall of Fame in October, and the Miners don't try to shoot teams into oblivion with three-pointers.""The girls' game has changed a lot since those days,"" McDaniel said.Now even reserve players are highly skilled and defensive schemes more sophisticated. Nevada Union has won with remarkable balance  junior Sydney Porter is the Miners' only double-figure scorer at 12.4 points per game  depth and chemistry.Seniors Emily Smith, Olivia Gulsvig, Sarina Orellana, Kaylin Martin and Nicole Lierly have played together since sixth grade. The same goes for juniors Porter, Erin Selleck, Katie Johnson, Melanie O'Brien and Emma Peterson. Sophomore Sammy DeHart, 5-foot-11, is a starter.""They're a bunch of gym rats,"" McDaniel said. ""The seniors have probably played close to 400 games together.""Says Del Oro coach Mike Takayama: ""They play really well together. They do a lot of great things. They shoot the ball well, and they're fast. They were deserving of the (league) championship.""Nevada Union last won a league title in 2005-06 when it was in the Metro Conference and coached by Duwaine Ganskie, now the Bear River boys coach.""The players' goal has been to bring this program back to the status it once enjoyed and get to a section final,"" McDaniel said. ""We're really excited. We're on the right track.""Brie is back  Although Brianna Ruiz's return from summer knee surgery gives Del Oro a huge boost going into the postseason, Takayama is still preaching caution.Takayama said the 5-foot-11 Ruiz played about six minutes in her season debut Tuesday on Senior Night against Roseville and nearly 15 minutes against Nevada Union, a game in which she scored 19 points and made five of eight three-point attempts.""Brie is moving very well, but we are only going to run her out there three or four minutes at a time,"" Takayama said. ""She has great loyalty and wants to help us finish as best we can, but we don't want to endanger her future.""Takayama said he and Ruiz made sure they got the OK from the women's coaching staff at the University of Washington, where Ruiz will play on scholarship next season.Streaks continue  No. 11 Rio Americano extended its area-best winning streak to 17 games with its 55-52 overtime win over Antelope on Monday.No. 5 Bradshaw Christian has the area's second-longest winning streak (16 games)."\u000a

V"Members of the Elk Grove City Council tonight are set to interview a half-dozen candidates seeking appointment to the District 4 vacancy and could, before the night is over, make their selection.The question on tap at the regularly scheduled council meeting: Who should serve the last half of the four-year post vacated last month after Councilman Gary Davis became the city's first directly elected mayor?Two women and four men are vying for the post. One is a city planning commissioner. One is a county prosecutor. Four are leaders in business.If the council fails to act tonight, it must make a decision no later than its Jan. 23 meeting. It can either fill the vacancy by appointment or call for a special election that could cost as much as $545,000.The candidates are: Edward J. Busuttil, a San Joaquin County assistant district attorney. Nancy De Anda Chaires, an Elk Grove planning commissioner and special programs consultant on migrant education for the state Department of Education. David Glenn Conner, the chief executive officer for RECON Networking Inc. of Elk Grove. LaWanna Montgomery, a teacher and president/CEO of Reach Learning Center. Oscar Portillo O'con, who operates a marketing and public relations business in Elk Grove. Jeffrey Sherwood Owen, vice president of operations for School Innovations & Advocacy of El Dorado Hills.Here's a brief look at each, based on interviews and, in some cases, information submitted to the city.Busuttil has been a prosecutor for more than 23 years.As an assistant district attorney, Busuttil oversees units focused on child abuse, sexual assault, elder abuse and domestic violence and assists in decisions on budget, personnel and policy.He's ready for the challenge of broader public service, he said.""As we come out of this recession slowly, I think we need to have smart managed growth and make sure public safety remains a priority,"" Busuttil said, ""because everything flows from our being a safe community.""Chaires has been a city planning commissioner since 2008. Now, she said, she's ready to be part of the ""full range of decisions"" that affect city residents.""I want to make sure that the residents of the 4th District and those across the city are represented with integrity, accountability and respect,"" she said. ""I feel compelled to put what I have learned through my work on the Planning Commission and in my career  into the service of the city and the broad array of issues that come before the council.""Conner, in introductory remarks at a recent League of Women Voters forum, described RECON as a non-profit, philanthropically minded trade association linked to commercial real estate and construction.""With my experience as a local business leader, I believe strongly that I can build on our efforts to attract jobs and promote economic development in our community,"" Conner wrote in the biography he filed with the city.Conner also cited the need to enhance public safety resources and ensure the city's quality of life.Montgomery's business is devoted to helping children make academic progress, according to its website.""I will work hard with the constituents in my area asking questions (about) how we can work together to make it better,"" Montgomery wrote in her application.""I believe that jobs, attracting businesses while retaining current businesses, building the (Elk Grove Promenade) mall, infrastructure, affordable housing, sports and education are top priorities,"" she added.O'con, who has a background in the military and law enforcement, is president of the Elk Grove Rotary. He founded and chairs the planned Elk Grove Regional Veterans Memorial, which he described as one of the few nationally that will honor living as well as deceased veterans.""As a veteran, I have unconditional love for this country and this town,"" O'con told The Bee. ""My kids have grown up here, and I hope to see my grandkids grow up in Elk Grove.""He said he seeks to promote small and large business development for the city. Owen describes himself as a longtime Elk Grove resident ready to embrace public service.""This is a city that has had extremely accelerated growth and an economic downturn.

V"Keith Worley is a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering. Sofia Barcena is a graduating senior who will accept a mechanical engineering degree in May. The two California State University, Sacramento, students had one thing in common Friday at the campus' annual Engineering and Computer Science career day: They were confident they would land a job.""I feel like a lot of companies are willing to share their experience. I feel like they're looking to hire,"" Barcena said during a break at career day. If Barcena wasn't confident enough, she had a cheering section in her corner. Barcena's mother, Amalia Barcena-Bosnich, and aunt Myrna Giannoulis made the trip from San Francisco to meet her at the career event. Worley felt just as optimistic about his chances after discussing internship opportunities with a representative from the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.""I have a good feeling that someone's going to be interested in me,"" Worley said. And, for the first time in awhile, the confidence appears to be well-founded. A thawing economy, pent-up hiring needs to meet demand for new technology and infrastructure, and growing confidence among employers all are good signs for young engineers, said Cici Mattiuzzi, director of career services at the CSUS College of Engineering and Computer Science.A new salary survey released Thursday by NACE, the National Association of Colleges and Employers, shows what Mattiuzzi is seeing on the ground. Engineering grads are a hot commodity, and they are seeing the starting salaries to prove it.Professional, scientific and technical services gobbled up the most grads in 2012, paying new hires nearly $62,000 a year to start, the survey stated. Manufacturers paid starting salaries of about $61,000, while government agencies paid new engineering graduates nearly $67,000 on average, according to the survey.""The demand for engineering graduates remains strong, and that is reflected in the high starting salaries paid to these graduates,"" said Marilyn Mackes, NACE executive director, in a statement announcing the report.Mattiuzzi said engineering students are more sought-after than they've been in several years. Indeed, representatives from more than 80 engineering and engineering-related firms attended the annual career event.Carl Broussard is an IT manager at Hewlett-Packard's Roseville campus. A 1989 Sacramento State graduate, Broussard was hired by the computer giant after graduation. Some 24 years later, he saw a new crop of talented young engineers.""What impresses me is the quality, caliber and enthusiasm of the students I've seen,"" he said. ""I'm definitely going to have follow-up discussions with the students I've seen today.""It's a different story than just a few years ago.During the recession, employers were still hiring engineers and other technical workers, ""but they had to do it without increasing costs,"" Mattiuzzi said. ""What we're seeing now is that as the general economy expands, it's raising boats."" And it's changing the way employers such as Marysville design-build firm Frank M. Booth Inc. are thinking about hiring. The firm ""held staff at a constant level"" during the recession, but did not add manpower, said Phil Ball, a chief engineer at the firm. Today, ""we're finding we have a need for students to help us to design and construct these buildings,"" Ball said. ""We're right on the cusp from an industry perspective. By next year, it's a given that we're going to need these people.""Let us hear from youIs your company hiring? Is your organization hosting a career fair?

V"Q Sacramento native Ron Cooper has had the best seat in the house as residents of all kinds took advantage of Access TV at Coloma Community Center studios on T Street over the last two decades.Cooper, 66, was there when local public TV programming was launched in 1987. After more than 20 years as executive director, Cooper announced he is retiring in August.During his tenure Access Sacramento added Web streaming capabilities for video and radio, and in 2000 the organization launched a film festival, ""A Place Called Sacramento,"" which has helped amateurs produce 129 films about the city, Cooper said.Access Sacramento, which broadcasts on channels 17 and 18 on local Comcast, SureWest and AT U-verse networks, operates with government grants. In exchange for the funds, the nonprofit provides residents broadcast access and training equipment.Given its responsibilities to the public, how is Access Sacramento different from commercial media? The story is the guiding principle here, not what can we do in service to advertisers to draw the most eyeballs. Because it's a free speech platform that encourages all voices, about 25 percent of our programs are in languages other than English. It's not only free speech in English; it's free speech in any language.Being open and accommodating sometimes means sometimes people won't agree with what goes on TV. Which programs caused the most negative feedback?Hate speech hasn't really been an issue so much in the last five or 10 years because of the growth of the Internet. In the early days we would see and hear words and situations that were technically constitutional speech, but a person would hear the words being said and take great offense. By law, we must show these programs. If you have a different point of view, you're entitled to come in and have the same opportunities. Who among the volunteers and hosts during your time at Access Sacramento will you most remember?One gentlemen who stands in mind was quadriplegic. If you were patient you could understand what he was saying. His whole world was a wheelchair he could operate with his chin because he could move his head. He came in and said he wanted to do a radio show. It was one of those times where in theory serving everybody sounds like a good thing, but all of us started thinking it wouldn't work. But the rules are the rules. Using sticks and little devices, he could use his mouth and grab the records. It was amazing what he could do."\u000a

V"When California eliminated local redevelopment agencies last year, there was one little agency  sitting in the shadows of the Capitol  it skipped.The Capitol Area Development Authority, a state and city redevelopment enterprise, was spared because its authorizing legislation is separate from the now-defunct state redevelopment law.But, it now turns out, CADA is not immune to state budget woes. Following a 2011 gubernatorial directive, CADA officials this month will unveil a 12-year plan to largely close down the agency's development operations and sell off a handful of state properties around the Capitol. The proceeds would go to the state general fund.CADA officials say they hope their agency will remain useful as a manager of affordable housing projects in the Capitol area, and that it might find ways to continue supporting development.""The challenge for CADA is to make sure the (redevelopment) goals and objectives are maintained"" for the still-emerging South Capitol neighborhood, said Wendy Saunders, who will take over April 1 as CADA executive director. Saunders, a former economic development director for the city of Sacramento, lauded the 35-year-old development agency for methodically bringing the neighborhood back to life as a live-work area.CADA was formed by the state and city of Sacramento in the late 1970s to redevelop empty and blighted state-owned land around the Capitol, and also to add affordable housing for state and downtown workers.The self-sustaining agency has funded projects through revenues from its rental properties. As redevelopment agencies once did, it also is able to capture a share of increased property taxes in its development area to fund projects. The agency has sold or granted state property to private developers, as well.""CADA has done a fabulous job of knitting together the fabric of downtown Sacramento,"" Saunders said. ""It has become a model of sustainable development that I think the Governor's Office ought to be bragging about nationwide.""They brought in workforce housing for every income level, and they brought retail to the core when no one was doing that.""The CADA zone is a roughly rectangular area bounded by L, S, Fifth and 20th streets. It's now home to a Safeway complex, restaurants, nightclubs, apartments, loft housing and new streetscapes.CADA is self-financed, mainly through rental and tax increment income. It manages 210 affordable apartment units it built or helped finance, and has developed 136 other affordable units managed by other entities.The agency is working with developers on an artists' lofts-style project on R Street at 11th Street that will offer 86 affordable apartments and about 30 market-rate units. It also has a project under way at 16th and O streets that will provide 84 market-rate units.The CADA plan, to be unveiled at a public forum March 22, will indicate how many more affordable housing units and other development projects the agency hopes to build or finance before its development days come to a close.CADA officials said they also will reveal which of their current properties they propose for sale, and which they hope to keep. CADA officials say they do not have an estimate yet of the value of those properties.""This is just a snapshot of what we think we can do,"" CADA board chairwoman Ann Bailey said. ""We have tried to put together a plan that is real. We'll see what people think of it.""Under its originating legislation, the agency is scheduled to dissolve entirely in 2042, officials said."\u000a

V"WASHINGTON  More than 140 women who'd championed Gulf Coast recovery after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were at it again Tuesday, convening on Capitol Hill to announce that they were supporting legislation that would guarantee the five Gulf Coast states at least 80 percent of BP's fines from last spring's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, an amount that could top $21 billion. If Gulf Coast recovery funding is postponed, it will cost the country dearly in the future to restore this region's essential contribution to America's sustainable food supplies, energy production and other natural resources, said Anne Milling, a New Orleans activist who founded the group, Women of the Storm, in 2006. We are bound by a common passion, she said at a news conference, surrounded by women from all walks of life who stood under their signature bright blue umbrellas  meant to symbolize the blue tarps that were placed over hurricane-ripped roofs  despite the sunny skies on the upper Senate lawn. The fines, levied as part of the Clean Water Act, are separate from the $20 billion BP already has dedicated to assist residents affected by the spill in the five Gulf Coast states: Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Alabama. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson also spoke at the news conference, signaling some level of Obama administration support for directing the money to the Gulf Coast states for restoration, an idea promoted by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus in his Gulf restoration plan and by the national oil spill commission in its report. The legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., will introduce it soon in the Senate.  The women warmly greeted both lawmakers, and presented a petition of more than 130,000 signatures from around the country to show national support for Gulf Coast needs. The most colorful speaker may have been Gulf Shores, Ala., restaurateur Lucy Buffett  who owns the landmark restaurant LuLu's and is the sister of singer Jimmy Buffett  who began by saying that she wasn't political but passionate about the Gulf.

""Everybody's looking forward to the system moving in so we can break out of the meteorological drought.""He said the Sierra Nevada ""could see a foot of snow, possibly more, at higher elevations.""After heavy precipitation in November and December, January and February were unusually dry. Sacramento saw just 1.32 inches the first two months of the year, the third-driest January and February since record keeping began in 1850.In the northern Sierra, only 2.2 inches of precipitation fell in the first two months of the year. The region is critical because it's home to key Northern California reservoirs.Although Sacramento saw just brief sprinkles Sunday, some outlying areas saw hail and heavier rains. Pea-sized hail fell in the Camino-Pollock Pines area during early afternoon, the weather service said. Heavy rain and wind were reported in areas around Galt, Lodi and Stockton. The weather service issued a ""significant weather advisory"" for Sunday afternoon in northern San Joaquin County.Motorists can expect patchy fog early today, with a high near 68 degrees.Tuesday will be mostly cloudy, with rain expected sometime after 4 p.m. The chance of precipitation was pegged at 60 percent.Wednesday will be rainy, with a chance of thunderstorms.

Board member Patrick Kennedy said they are likely to approve it and keep the schools open.""It's (closing schools) hard enough to do with the support of the superintendent,"" Kennedy said. ""But you never know for sure.""On Feb. 21, the board approved the closure of Washington, Maple, Collis P. Huntington, Fruit Ridge, Joseph Bonnheim, Mark Hopkins and Clayton B. Wire elementary schools because of declining student enrollment. Raymond had initially proposed closing 11 elementary schools, but pulled three of them from the list at the Feb. 21 board meeting.The urban district of 47,000 students has lost 10 percent of its enrollment in the past decade and anticipates further declines in the coming years, including 800 students next school year.Tahoe Elementary at 3110 60th St. has an enrollment of 315 students with a capacity of 822. Mark Twain Elementary at 4914 58th St. has an enrollment of 343 students with a capacity of 891, according to the district.The superintendent's recommendation gives a number of reasons for his change of heart, including input from the Tahoe and Mark Twain communities.""Additionally, the superintendent's recommendations recognize the overwhelming desire throughout the district to put this difficult matter to rest and immediately devote all resources and energy towards the transition process underway at the seven sites already voted to be closed,"" said the recommendation. Kennedy said it is a big task to close a school and to transition students and staff members to other campuses. He said Raymond is likely ""starting to feel the district is at its tipping point.  He was probably feeling he's taken on as much as he could.""If the board agrees with the superintendent and closes seven schools, it will save $1.08 million in 2013-14 and $1.2 million in 2014-15, instead of the $1.3 million and $1.5 million estimated for eight schools. The recommendations said the savings would grow each year after that."\u000a

V"UC Davis Granada Artist in Residence Juliette Carrillo presents a new interpretation of Federico Garca Lorca's seminal 1936 drama ""The House of Bernarda Alba,"" based on a new adaptation by Chay Yew. Lorca called his play ""a drama of women in the villages of Spain,"" and he completed it just two months before his death during the Spanish Civil War. The story is centered on an Andalusian household of women who are forced into a period of eight years of mourning by the overbearing family matriarch, Bernarda Alba. She wields authoritarian control over her five daughters who live in the home. Carrillo includes dance and song in the production, which is inspired by duende, the Spanish sense of soul often seen and felt in the art of flamenco.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/28/5224074/mayor-johnson-may-reveal-kings.html,"Do the whales finally surface tonight?If all goes according to plan, Mayor Kevin Johnson could reveal the identities of his ""whales""  the investors he's recruited to bid for the Sacramento Kings  at his State of the City address.It's widely believed the investors are financiers Ron Burkle and Mark Mastrov, who've been talking privately to the mayor for weeks about a plan to keep the Kings from moving to Seattle.Separately, another potential Kings suitor emerged this week: John Kehriotis, who already owns 12 percent of the team. It wasn't clear, however, if Kehriotis could pull together all the funding he needs.Time is running short for anyone trying to buy the Kings. The Maloof family, which controls 65 percent of the team, has already made a deal to sell to a Seattle group. NBA Commissioner David Stern has said Sacramento's competing offer must be submitted to the league by Friday.And, in the weeks to come, the city and the Burkle-Mastrov group must send the NBA a financing plan for a new arena  a critical element to convincing the league the Kings should stay.Johnson adviser Kunal Merchant said earlier this week the announcement of the investors could come at the State of the City speech. As of Wednesday, however, mayoral spokesman Ben Sosenko wouldn't confirm that.The speech would be an apt setting for a big announcement. Normally a staid luncheon affair, this year's State of the City address has been transformed by Johnson into a public gala at Memorial Auditorium, with corporate sponsorship and live music.Stern has said the NBA board of governors will make a decision in mid-April on the Maloofs' plan to sell the Kings to a Seattle group led by hedge fund manager Chris Hansen and Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer. That group needs a three-quarters supermajority approval from the board.If the NBA rejects the Seattle deal, city officials are hoping the Maloofs will accept a counteroffer from Burkle and Mastrov.A source close to the situation confirmed Wednesday the Maloofs would accept ""backup offers"" if the Seattle deal falls through.This source said the Maloofs have an exclusive agreement with Hansen prohibiting them from negotiating with anyone else. Any new offer ""would have to be a backup offer to the definitive agreement between the Hansen-Ballmer group and the Maloofs,"" the source said.Hansen and Ballmer agreed to buy the Maloofs' controlling interest in a deal that values the total franchise at $525 million, according to Seattle city officials. That implies a $341 million payout to the Maloofs and their business partner Bob Hernreich for their controlling share.Kings co-owner Joe Maloof confirmed Wednesday that the family received a $30 million down payment on the team from the Hansen group. His comment came in response to an Orlando, Fla., radio report that the deposit had not been paid.Working separately from Burkle and Mastrov, Kehriotis has told two city councilmen he is developing his own purchase offer and arena plan.According to Councilmen Steve Cohn and Kevin McCarty, Kehriotis says he has lined up $350 million to buy out the Maloofs but needs another $400 million for a new arena. A real estate developer, Kehriotis would build the new facility next to Sleep Train Arena in Natomas. Unlike Burkle and Mastrov, he wouldn't seek a public subsidy, other than the donation of 100 acres of city-owned land at the Natomas site.Kehriotis declined to comment on the issue.Cohn said he was ""skeptical"" Kehriotis could assemble all the financing, but he nonetheless finds the idea intriguing. ""I have no idea whether there is meat to his plan,"" Cohn said. ""If he can pull that off, we can save ourselves a lot of money.""McCarty said he asked City Manager John Shirey to speak with Kehriotis. ""I feel this is a path we ought to consider, because it does not include a huge public subsidy,"" McCarty said.Burkle and Mastrov have talked with the city about a subsidy for an arena at Downtown Plaza or the downtown railyard. On Tuesday, the City Council voted 7-2  with McCarty one of the ""no"" votes  to launch formal negotiations.City officials indicate they would provide the investors with up to $255 million  the amount provided for a proposed railyard arena last spring. The Maloofs abandoned that deal.Kehriotis told the councilmen that, as a limited partner, he believes he has the right to buy the team by matching the Seattle offer.Similarly, the bankruptcy trustee auctioning off a 7 percent share of the Kings has said he, too, believes the team's limited partners have the right to match the Seattle offer.But so far the trustee hasn't pressed that claim in court. Stern said recently he doesn't think this is a ""defining issue"" in determining what happens to the Kings."\u000a

V"Kyle Zanzi is a scholar who packs the sort of grade-point average that makes you nod and wonder just how large and active his brain is.The Franklin High School junior revels in his Advanced Placement physics and calculus courses, and he's a pretty fair baseball talent, too.The junior outfielder scored the go-ahead run with two outs in the top of the eighth inning on a Taylor Waters single, and senior ace Josh Pigg slammed the door in relief to key an 8-6 victory over Davis on Tuesday night in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I North semifinals at Sacramento City College.As if that wasn't reason enough for the upstarts for Elk Grove to celebrate, Zanzi's father, John, blushed when his 50th birthday was announced by public address voice Steve Gill early in this rivalry rematch of Delta Valley Conference foes as Zanzi family members handed out cupcakes.Pigg earned the win in relief, striking out seven. He struck out the side in the sixth and final innings. Pigg relieved fellow senior Kyle Von Ruden, who struck out nine and really only struggled in the first inning, a frame that ended 4-4.Pigg tied the score 6-6 with a two-out hit up the middle in the seventh. He may start the title game Friday against the winner of the Thursday losers' bracket finale between Vacaville and Davis. Franklin could go with Tyler Blake, who tossed a complete-game gem to beat Elk Grove 9-1 on Saturday. Perhaps Brandon Keup starts?In other words, a lot of arms and possibilities for first-year coach Bryan Kilby. His pitching coach is his brother Brad, who pitched several seasons in the A's organization and is hopeful of a return.Bryan Kilby said he is delighted with the makeup and poise of his young team.""Zanzi's a brilliant kid, way smarter than us coaches,"" he said.""Von Ruden is our guy, the leader. He wants to do everything right. Pigg is a super athletic kid. He'd be unbelievable in football and basketball but he loves baseball. You want the ball in his hands because he gives you everything he's got. So many great guys.""Ryan Sarginson had two hits, Pigg two RBIs and Adams had a two-run single.Senior Ben Eckels had a three-run triple in the first and John Ariola had two hits and three RBIs for Davis. Eckels will likely start against Vacaville on Thursday. He struck out 12 last Thursday in a 5-2 win over Oak Ridge.Granite Bay 12, McClatchy 7 at American River College  Sophomore designated hitter Justin Lehman continued his hot postseason, belting a three-run homer for the Grizzlies, who closed out the Lions in this best-of-three series to reach the Division II title game Monday at Sac City.The Grizzlies, who led McClatchy 11-0 after two innings, play the winner of today's other D-II semifinal between Rocklin and Woodcreek.Valley Christian 7, Elliot Christian 5 at Sacramento State  Isaac Van Patten had three hits as the Lions reached the D-VII title game a fifth straight season."\u000a

V"I get the feeling that playwright Jason Wells intended his farce ""The North Plan"" as a cautionary black comedy about the potentially draconian results of the Homeland Security Act. Along the way he created an outrageously funny character named Tanya Shepke, who hijacked the play.Tanya's dumb as a post, but she works a twangy, loudmouthed, f-bomb-based redneck rap that puts audiences in stitches. With Katie Rubin's brassy, confident performance as Tanya at its center, the new Capital Stage production of ""The North Plan"" blows through Wells' plotless narrative.Actually, Wells does try to tell a slight story, and he does drop in an even slighter back story, both of which serve to keep a number of characters within earshot of Tanya's rantings. She's in the lockup of the city of Lodus, which we learn is a two-street, four-streetlight town in southern Missouri. (The fine police station set was designed by Jonathan Williams.)Tanya turned herself in for drunken driving, but that act of good citizenship hasn't turned out quite like she planned, though it's hard to imagine any of her ideas working out the way she thought they might.Stuck in her one-person cell, Tanya verbally bombards administrative assistant Shonda Cox (Alexandra Barthel). Shonda is a young African American woman trying to work her way through law school, and her job includes watching the occasional female prisoner. Barthel emerges as the true co-star and subtle core of this production with her understated but rock-solid performance. While Tanya's world revolves hilariously around Tanya, there's something weird going on in the outside world. Has there been a coup, or is there some sort of insurgency? It's not clear, but the government, including the military, is mobilized to emergency levels. Soon joining Tanya in the male side of the lockup is Carlton Berg (Cassidy Brown) a midlevel member of the State Department. Homeland Security agents want Berg because of some information he has. The hapless agents (excellent comic performances from William Elsman and Andrew Perez) can't find the information they know Berg has, so offstage they resort to what we imagine are extreme measures. Harry Harris adds depth as laconic Chief Swenson, who wants to keep control of his little station. Wells creates scenes that are both funny and creepy as the agents attempt to find someone in authority to (literally) sign off on doing what needs to be done to find the information. Never mind that in this modern world (the play is set in the near future) Carlton could have easily disseminated the information he's ""hidden"" from the feds. Plausibility can be the enemy of comedy, so Wells often overlooks it as he keeps the laughs rolling. With little story to start with, Wells doesn't have much to conclude, so he just caps it off, so to speak.Director Peter Mohrmann knows where the gold is here, and he basically turns Rubin loose, which isn't such a bad thing.THE NORTH PLAN  What: Jason Wells' farce about a shadowy American government takeover and those trying to stop it.Where: Capital Stage, 2215 J St., SacramentoWhen: Performances continue at 7 p.m. Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and 2 p.m. Sundays through Feb. 24Tickets: $22-$32 Information: (916) 995-5464 or go to www.capstage.org.Running time: Two hours including one intermission.Note: ""The North Plan"" includes strong language and violence and is intended for adult audiences."\u000a

Just a few hundred votes have divided candidates as they played musical chairs with the first three spots while the county updated election results over the last two weeks.But the music has stopped.Incumbent Heredia was the top voter-getter with 6,198 votes. Herche finished second with 5,733 votes, while Dosick came in third with 5,566 votes, according to results released by the county Wednesday.The rest of the field trailed by at least 400 votes.""I'm excited about serving my fourth term and I thank the voters for their confidence,"" Heredia said Wednesday.She plans to spend some time getting acquainted with the new board members and working with the rest of the board to build a unified vision. ""We need to build that vision around input from parents, teachers, and the community and school employees,"" Heredia said.The county has finished counting mail-in ballots, but it is still counting provisional ballots  used to record a vote when there are questions about a voter's eligibility.About 27,000 provisional ballots were yet to be processed countywide as of Wednesday. But with only a small number of them left in Natomas, no change is expected in the school district race, said Brad Buyse, the county's campaign services manager.The election comes on the heels of a tumultuous period at the school district that included near bankruptcy and continued negotiations to resolve a land dispute. The district began to reorganize in January after a board-commissioned report by School Services of California Inc. blasted Natomas Unified management for excessive employee sick days and a culture that did not hold employees accountable.Heredia, Herche  a 27-year-old legislative analyst  and Dosick  a 41-year-old teacher and business owner  will be sworn in Dec. 12.""I'm really fired up,"" said Herche, who ran unsuccessfully for the school board in 2010. ""I'm ready to get to work. I think it will be a challenge.""Herche said he will make good on his promise to ask the board for a resolution requiring district meetings be videotaped. He also will work on improving the district's low-performing schools and bridging the achievement gap.Dosick, who has served on the citizens bond oversight committee and budget advisory committee, said he is ready to ""hit the ground running.""""I'm very excited about the opportunity to work with my fellow school board members and to follow through on all we campaigned on  ensuring all 12,000 students and parents have access to high-quality programs and services,"" he said."\u000a

They walk with a swagger, have an air of confidence and have an unquenchable thirst to succeed.Cooper and Tellez are The Bee's 2012 Softball and Baseball Players of the Year for their on-field production, and  yes  their postgame sportsmanship. It was common for their respective coaches to field calls or emails from spectators who admired the efforts and postgame candor of Cooper and Tellez.Engaging off the field, Cooper and Tellez admit they transform once in uniform, and they laughed about it with family and friends during a Bee photo shoot Monday.An imposing 6-foot senior slugger and pitching ace, Cooper took it personally when her Huskies backed into the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I playoffs as the third-place team in the Delta River League.

""She has a quiet tenacity. You could just see it on the mound. In the playoffs, she kept saying, 'We can do this. We can win it.' Coop just had that fight in her and wasn't going to give up.""Cooper summed up the Sheldon regular season as ""crazy."" As a pitcher, she suffered losses of 9-0 and 10-0.""I took it hard and felt like I was letting my team down, wasn't doing enough,"" Cooper said. ""But I learned you give it an hour after the game and let it go. You learn and move on or it'll really get to you. We got better and I got better.""Tellez enters a busy summer of travel-team baseball, where he'll continue to be scrutinized by major league scouts.Even when nobody is watching, Tellez will still be working.""You can always get better because somewhere there's someone working harder,"" Tellez said. ""I definitely have a drive for this game. It means everything to me. I know it's a game of failure because you can't always get a hit, but you have to be positive even if it doesn't look that way.""Asked to summarize his season, Tellez grinned and said, ""I wasn't half bad.

V"Jessica Funkhouser's specialty is putting together small clamps that attach conduits to the wall, but she has big dreams. At 28, she likes dragons and dinosaurs, heavy metal music and history. She wants to be a writer.At Pride Industries' Auburn workshop  where her father, 61-year-old Tom Funkhouser, a Navy veteran and Hewlett Packard retiree, works as a production trainer across the floor from Jessica's work table  she puts on her turquoise earphones and deals with the clamps.""I usually just do clamp, clamp, clamp,"" she said. But she's working, and she likes that.When she was born with a rare genetic disorder causing developmental disabilities and physical challenges, doctors told Tom and Patti Funkhouser that their tiny, dark-haired daughter would never walk or talk. She probably wouldn't even survive childhood, doctors said.""They said Jessica would be a vegetable,"" her father said. ""They said we should institutionalize her. But Patti and I are not that way. We were terrified, but we brought her home, and we loved her very much.""Four years later, the couple's younger daughter, Lori, now 24, was born with the same disorder. The daughters have autosomal recessive microcephaly with agenesis of the corpus callosum, a heavy-duty term that means, among other things, that the two hemispheres of the brain can't communicate normally.Now Tom and Patti Funkhouser, who have no other children, are facing the issue that haunts parents of adult children with special needs: What happens to their daughters after they're gone?""We just hope it doesn't come to that point, but I know it will,"" said Patti Funkhouser, 55. ""I worry about it. We're getting older. What do we do? Right now, we're taking it day to day.""Across the country, according to U.S. Census figures, 20 percent of adults below age 65 have developmental or physical disabilities  and almost 70 percent of the families of special-needs adults in a recent MetLife survey said they worried about their offspring's future.The Alta California Regional Center, which serves 18,250 people with developmental disabilities in 10 counties, has about 5,000 adult clients who still live at home with their parents, just as Jessica and Lori do.""And every one of those clients will age,"" said Phil Bonnet, the regional center's executive director. ""People who grew up in our system are now middle-aged, and their parents are older.""As a result, said the executive director of Sacramento's Resources for Independent Living, Frances Gracechild: ""We have this phenomenon of aging parents with increasing need for support themselves, and they're still taking care of their grown developmentally disabled children.""It's quite a burden to meet when you're facing your 70s.""As they age, the parents of the adult developmentally disabled may need legal counseling to put together a special-needs trust to care for their offspring, and they may need advice on residential options, said Fran Smith, a Yolo County advocate for the developmentally disabled. Two of her children had cerebral palsy.""I was always worried about what my kids would do when I die, but they both predeceased me,"" she said. ""Parents need a coach. They need somebody to help them. Thinking about what will happen to your grown child after you're gone is painful.""I've heard people say, 'I'll think about it when I'm older,' and they're in their 70s.""The Funkhousers are diligently putting together employment and independent living skills for Jessica. She has worked for Pride for six years, a little longer than her father has coached other employees  but not his own daughter  on their product assembly skills.Her parents say that Jessica's patience and social proficiency have improved over that time. Now, with the help of her Pride counselor, she's working on becoming more punctual.But she's in no rush to live on her own.""I've thought about living independently many times,"" she said, ""but I go right back to the fact that I want to live with Mom and Dad. I depend greatly on my Mom. When I'm away from home, I feel lonely. I want my Mom. I'm just not comfortable.""On the other hand, her younger sister  whom the Funkhousers describe as having the communication level of a 3-year-old as well as severe physical problems  requires 24-hour care.""I worry about my sister a lot,"" Jessica said.The Funkhousers are still considering the plans they need to put in place to care for their daughters in the future. They have concerns and questions  but as of yet, no answers.""You take every day as it comes,"" said Patti Funkhouser. ""You deal with what comes, and you thank God they're still here. And then you start over the next day."""\u000a

V"The Bee's Joe Davidson looks back at five memorable Nevada Union-Grant games:  1992NEVADA UNION 7, GRANT 6In the second head-to-head meeting between Nevada Union coach Dave Humphers and Grant coach Mike Alberghini, the host Miners won when an extra point by Grant missed by inches. Grant got revenge with a 34-6 rout in what was then called the City Championship en route to the school's first section crown.  1996NEVADA UNION 21, GRANT 19In the ""Revenge Bowl,"" Nevada Union held off the host Pacers and quarterback Chad Elliott, who transferred to Grant for his senior year after leading the Miners to a Sac-Joaquin Section championship in 1994 as a sophomore. One Nevada Union fan on the sideline yelled, ""Kill him!"" when Elliott was hit near the sideline. Elliott and the Pacers had the last laugh, however, rolling to the Division I Sac-Joaquin Section title.  2002NEVADA UNION 43, GRANT 40With playoff seedings and bragging rights on the line, the Miners won behind quarterback Jon Sheets and junior varsity running back call-up Ryan Herrera, who scored three times.  2004GRANT 24, NEVADA UNION 21Future NFL player Syd Thompson led the Pacers to their last win in the series that stopped for seven years after the 2005 season. Nevada Union's final 67-yard drive ended as time ran out.  2003NEVADA UNION 25, GRANT 21With time running out and on Grant's 39-yard line, the Miners went with a trick play. Quarterback Jarad Van Matre threw a sideline pass to tight end Steven Davis, who then threw back to Van Matre, who raced down the right sideline and into the end zone. The victory in Grass Valley capped a 10-0 regular season, though Grant went on to win the section title.Editor's note: This story was changed on Aug. 30 to reflect that the 1992 game was the two schools' second head-to-head meeting."\u000a

V"Date night will happen this evening in the Dimino family, and it will include one very satisfied, it not spent, football coach.Mike Dimino wore the expression of relief and pride after his gritty No. 8-ranked Del Campo Cougars held off a late drive by host and No. 19 Rio Linda for an entertaining 34-28 victory to decide the Capital Valley Conference championship in the regular season's final week.That's league title No. 6 for Dimino, the 10-year veteran coach who admits the only one he adores more than his beloved Cougars is his wife, Sonia.What has kept their marriage fresh after 30 years of football and a stressful occupation  Dimino worked for years as a CHP officer  is a once-a-week night out on the town. Sometimes it even includes dancing, though those who know Dimino best insist his legs and moves are shot.""Even if we lost, I'd have to go (on date night), or I'd be crying in my soup,"" Dimino cracked.There'll be no crying here, and the Diminos may have to invite some supper company. How about the Cougars' offensive line and fullback Austin Brown, who bulled his way for 77 rushing yards and had scoring runs of one, two and six yards? Maybe set a plate for unsung tailback Chris Gonzales, who scored the game winner on a one-yard run with 3:33 to go, his only carry of the game. Josh Blumgold added 52 rushing yards and quarterback Derek Rodigo 32.This is what Del Campo (8-2, 5-0) does best: grind away with a punishing line surge that features A.J. Samataua, Dre Martinez, JJ Tufu and Kyle Evanski. Rodigo provided balance as his 23-yard touchdown pass to Adrian Rocha early in the fourth quarter put the Cougars ahead 28-21.Dustin Rossiter came in with five touchdown passes for Rio Linda (8-2, 4-1) and had three against Del Campo on strikes of 30 and 35 yards to Keenan Hunt and 24 to J.T. Loudon. Rio Linda was driving for the winning score before Rocha sealed it with an end zone interception, though Knights coaches and fans howled for a pass interference.Dimino said of his team before the game, ""We're not very fast but we compete.""They will now compete for a Division II Sac-Joaquin Section title after winning two crowns in D-III under Dimino. The D-II field is beyond formidable and includes Folsom, St. Mary's of Stockton, Elk Grove and defending champion Vacaville.Rio Linda is also in the D-II mix. The Knights would have set a school record for victories in the regular season with a 9-1 finish.Rio Linda coach Mike Morris said he likes his team's playoff chances, particularly if the ground game is on track with Marcel Brown, a talented sophomore who ran for 82 yards against Del Campo, including a 21-yard touchdown.""Both of us get a little fancy with the pass, then we get back to doing what we do  run,"" Morris said of his team and Del Campo. ""That's a typical Del Campo team  physical. Our program respects them a great deal. We understand that mentality of physical play and we enjoy it."""\u000a

V"Don't look for clich train photography at a new exhibit at the California State Railroad Museum.The 21 photographs show people, weather and out-of-the-boxcar photo technique.The photographs, from the Center for Railroad Photography & Arts creative photo awards program, follow the theme of the 2012 competition: ""Railroading, Inspired by Steinheimer.""The name refers to late Sacramento resident Richard Steinheimer, who was called ""the Ansel Adams of railroad photography.""The contest was judged by his widow, Shirley Burman Steinheimer, herself a fine photographer of trains, trestles and the people who make rail transportation work.""I looked for photos that 'Stein' liked taking  especially crummy weather, landscapes and night shots using time exposures and moonlight, along with people,"" she said.The grand prize went to Chris Starnes of Gate City, Va. It shows a CSX northbound empty coal train crossing the Copper Creek viaduct in Clinchport, Va.""Dick Steinheimer loved photographing in fog, and I know he would have picked this image, too,"" his widow wrote in her judging comments.With separate categories for color and black-and-white submissions this year, the first-place prizes went to Robert Day of Fillongley, Coventry, England, (color) and to Shel Michaels of Hollis, N.H. (black and white).In addition, two California photographers received recognition in the ""Judge Also Liked"" category: Dick Dorn of Yuba City and Mark Jones of Vacaville.Burman Steinheimer recently answered a few questions about railroad photography and the photo contest: What makes a good railroad photograph?That's like asking what makes a good pizza. It can be anything. I look for the unique and different kind of settings.Judging had to be difficult. Did you think of your late husband's photographic techniques when you were judging?I looked at 200 entries. They were so good. I finally culled it down to 80. I had a whole month to do this. Every picture I eventually selected had something in it that reminded me of something he had done.Why do railroads still hold such an attraction to us?Railroads go back to the beginnings of our country. These memories get passed down from generation to generation. You can see a little 5-year-old as excited as anybody about a train.How is train photography different from making pictures of people?With people, if you don't get it right, then you can reshoot real quick. But with moving trains you can't do it over.Is there a range of emotions a railroading picture can elicit? I'm thinking a train picture can project nostalgia, power or beauty.Oh, yes. It not only comes through in photography, but there is railroad poetry. And music, too. Those train songs can make you weep.What made Starnes' shot the grand prize winner?When I looked at those 200 photographs, I zeroed right in on Chris'. One of our favorite places to photograph was in the fog. Dick loved it. And the way Chris framed it with black twigs is great. It would not have been as good if he had moved out from under the branches and just had the train on the trestle. It brought back a lot of memories of jumping in the car and Dick saying: ""Let's go shoot in the fog today.""In photojournalism, news- paper photographers look for interaction of people to make a good picture. That's not needed in railroad photography, it seems. Why not?We tried to have people when we shot. I can remember trying to photograph people milling around a locomotive with all the other photographers screaming for the people to get out of the way at a rail fair. I was trying to get them in the picture! If we were out in Arizona at a remote railyard and there were rail crews with a shift change, Dick would run over and look for interaction. He did not like stagnant trains. If the train was moving, hopefully a crew member would lean out of the cab. Dick worked for a newspaper, so that made a difference.Who entered this contest?They came from all over the world, including Australia, Switzerland, Slovenia. They have all types of jobs: technical writers, electrical engineers, graphic designers, architects, professors and pharmaceutical sales. The age range was from 26 to 65.RAIL PHOTO EXHIBITIONWhat: Special exhibition of 2012 award-winning photographs from the Center for Railroad Photography & Arts Where: California State Railroad Museum, Old Sacramento State Historic Park, 111 I St., Sacramento When: Through summerCost: $10 adults; $5 youths ages 6-17; free for children ages 5 and under Information: (916) 445-6645; www.californiastaterailroadmuseum.org or www.railphoto-art.org"\u000a

V"Wednesday was an unusually deadly day at the Foresthill Bridge near Auburn. Within minutes of each other, two people committed suicide by jumping off the span.Officials said there is no evidence to suggest the two incidents were related.The deaths bring the number of suicides at the bridge to 64 in its 39-year history, according to an unofficial tally.At 730-feet high, the Foresthill Bridge is the fourth highest in the country and the highest span in California. The people who died Wednesday were Jacob Charles Fetsch, 26, of Dobbins and Valerie Gail Garcia, 35, of Auburn. Fetsch was found dead at 4:47 p.m. Garcia was found dead 5:50 p.m., within minutes of the completion of the recovery of Fetsch's body. ""It just makes you wonder whether she saw the activity,"" said Dena Erwin, a spokesman for the Placer County Sheriff's Department.Erwin said the bridge has sadly become a destination for people contemplating suicide.In one incident, a Davis woman who was talked out of jumping and placed on a three-day mental health hold returned to commit suicide two weeks later. ""Whatever was bothering her was too much,"" Erwin said.The bridge did have a dual suicide in 2005 when husband and wife Bryon and Sallee Kincannon of Brownsville jumped, taking their dog with them.Modest steps are under way to make it harder for those attempting suicide off the span. A federally funded seismic retrofit and paint job will raise fences from the present 4 feet to 6 feet. The project won't be completed until late 2013, said Ken Grehm, the county's public works director. ""I hope that it will make a difference,"" Grehm said. ""It will require more work to lift (oneself) over a 6-foot fence.""The bridge also has suicide hotline phones. ""It's not a fail-safe solution,"" Grehm said. ""I don't think there is a fail-safe solution."""\u000a

V"Ryan Mason understands the occasional double take.From certain angles, with his distinctive facial features and long dark hair, the Placer High School senior pitcher could be confused for Giants ace Tim Lincecum.But once Mason stands, there is no confusion. He is a towering 6-foot-6, while the compact Lincecum is a stretch at 5-11.""I get Tim Lincecum a lot  a little bit because of the hair and the face,"" Mason said. ""He's my favorite player because he's got nasty stuff. But we have completely different pitching styles.""Mason would like to show Lincecum his own style of pitching someday in the major leagues, where he's wanted to be since he was barely out of diapers.""When I was 3, I'd throw a tennis ball in the cross-hairs of the couch all day long,"" Mason said. ""I'd do it for so long my parents would finally say at night, 'Enough.' ""Although he could spend all day, every day in a baseball endeavor of some sort, he's no one-dimensional jock. He maintains a 3.85 grade-point average, looks to major in sports psychology in college and  for pleasure, mind you  likes to study theoretical astronomy.Because of his grades, size and power sinker, Mason is headed to Cal on scholarship.The Bears' baseball program was briefly axed before a last-ditch fundraising push got it reinstated just before what was to be its swan-song season last spring.Against the longest of odds, the Bears reached the College World Series in 2011 for the first time since 1992.""You could see by watching them on TV that they were a family, not just a team,"" said Mason, who didn't think he had a chance at playing at the Pacific-12 Conference level at the time. ""Their resiliency was amazing.""Mason understands resiliency.After a shining sophomore season in which he pitched a no-hitter, a one-hitter and was the team's ace, Mason pitched sporadically as a junior because of stiffness in his right throwing shoulder.""He had a tough spell last season,"" said Placer coach John Hilton. ""He had some shoulder-nerve issues. It was really upsetting for him because he wasn't able to pitch as effectively as he would have liked.""Mason sought help from a Roseville physical therapist, who helped him work through his issues. Upon returning to the mound, he pitched well against top competition last summer for the Colorado Rockies' development team. Well enough that he caught the attention of Mike Neu, Cal's pitching coach who played at Sacramento City College before pitching for the A's.Unless he gets drafted and signs a pro contract this summer, Mason will join a half-dozen area players at Cal, including Oak Ridge's Kyle Porter, who made three freshman All-America teams in 2011.""It's just a great fit for me,"" Mason said. ""Coach Neu is really genuine and will help me develop my game, and I love the campus and the area  Berkeley is diverse. It's a big change from Auburn, but I'll enjoy that.""Mason has one bit of unfinished business.He'd like to help Placer reach the playoffs for the first time since the Hillmen won the Division IV section title in 2009.Although Placer is 2-3 in the Pioneer Valley League, the Hillmen played well in this week's River City Classic tournament  reaching Wednesday's championship game  which has boosted the team's confidence.Mason and senior A.J. Sanchez provide a nice one-two punch on the mound, while 6-4, 295-pound junior Eddie Vanderdoes delivers the wallop as a closer and spot starter.On Monday, the left-handed Vanderdoes struck out 16 batters and allowed one hit in six innings in a 9-3 win over Churchill County of Fallon, Nev.""You could see from an early age (Vanderdoes) was going to be a big thing, a special athlete,"" Mason said. ""He's always had a presence. He's extremely athletic and runs so fast for someone who is 300 pounds."""\u000a

V"ASacramento Regional Transit bus pulls up to a stop. A rider with a bike is there, but the two-bike rack on the front bumper of the bus is filled, so the cyclist must wait for the next bus.It happens daily, RT head Mike Wiley said. He knows. He's a bus and bike commuter. It's happened to him a half dozen times.RT officials hope to change that. But it's not easy. They have grant money to buy racks that hold three bikes. Under state law, however, those racks make RT buses too long to legally drive the streets. Assemblyman Roger Dickinson, D-Sacramento, introduced legislation last week to make length allowances.""We want to make our system more accessible, and encourage bike use,"" Wiley said.Bay Bridge WalkBack in 1987, on the Golden Gate Bridge's 50th birthday, cars were banned and people were allowed to walk the span. It didn't turn out well.So many people showed up that walkers got jammed shoulder to shoulder, unable to move. The bridge's suspension section actually sagged. Engineers frantically calculated how much weight the bridge could hold. It held. But bridge people learned a lesson.This Labor Day weekend, before the opening of the new Bay Bridge east span, officials will allow pedestrians to walk the bridge from Oakland to San Francisco.This time, they'll sell tickets, limit walkers to 125,000, and send groups off in intervals.

V"Burbank's Calvin Green is nicknamed ""Flash""  and for good reason.With his running ability, pass catching skills and defensive tenaciousness, the speedy Green can quickly change the outcome of a game.The junior did it over and over against visiting Pleasant Grove on Saturday in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division I quarterfinal at Burbank High School.Green rushed for a touchdown, caught a touchdown pass and had two timely interceptions as the No. 2-seeded Titans held off the No. 10 Eagles 32-27 in a battle of respected rivals.The win advances the Titans (12-0) to Saturday's semifinals at Titan Stadium against No. 3 Oak Ridge (11-1), the same team that knocked Burbank out of the playoffs, 30-28, in the first round last season.Green remembers that game well, having played an important role for the Titans as a sophomore.""We need some redemption because Oak Ridge beat us up at our home last year,"" Green said. ""We're hungry now.""The 5-foot-10, 170-pound Green had an appetite for big plays Saturday.He rushed for 110 yards and scored the Titans' first touchdown on a 49-yard burst around left end in which he broke a couple of tackles, then tip-toed along the sideline to stay in bounds. He also scored Burbank's last touchdown on a diving catch of a 16-yard pass from quarterback Ernest Jenkins.But Green's most spectacular play came early in the third quarter, just after Burbank took a 26-14 lead on a 61-yard touchdown dash by Jenkins.With the ball on Burbank's 43-yard line on first down and the aggressive Titans expecting a run play, Pleasant Grove quarterback Deaundre Terrell sent a long spiral soaring toward Esley Simmons, all alone behind the Titans' defense.But the ball bounced off Simmons' hands and popped into the air. As the junior wide receiver appeared about to grab his deflection, Green, running at a full sprint, reached in and got his hands on the ball as the two wrestled each other into the end zone.""I got a bead on it,"" Green said. ""I was fortunate to get there. But that's heart. We're taught never to give up.""Burbank coach John Heffernan said Green's hustle to make a play despite his initial embarrassment is indicative of why the Titans are having their best season in school history.""When you go undefeated, you have to have some things bounce your way,"" Heffernan said. ""  Calvin did a good job of wrestling him for it. That's the mentality of these kids. You don't give up on anything.""That touchdown-saving play proved important as Pleasant Grove (7-5) would fight back from an early 32-14 fourth-quarter deficit to make things tense for the Titans at the end.After Pleasant Grove's Ian Broom scored on an 11-yard run with 9:03 to play, Terrell threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Justin Bias to close to within five points with 23 seconds remaining.Pleasant Grove's onside kick attempt missed by less than a foot of going the required 10 yards, and the relieved Titans took a knee on the next play.""In the course of a high school football game between two good teams there are plays that go one way or another,"" Pleasant Grove coach Joe Cattolico said. ""They obviously made a couple more big plays than we did.""Burbank's Isaiah Williams rushed for 154 yards, including a 59-yard touchdown.  Division IINo. 1 Folsom 49, No. 9 Vacaville 13 in Folsom  Jake Browning passed for 380 yards and five touchdowns as the Bulldogs (12-0) avenged a loss to the Bulldogs of Solano County (8-4) in last season's D-II championship game.Browning, a sophomore, hit Troy Knox for scoring tosses of 19 and 13 yards and Josiah Deguara for 17 yards in the first half. In the second half, Browning found Trace Noble for touchdowns of 35 and 20 yards. Browning has passed for 4,527 yards and 55 touchdowns this season."\u000a

V"The man known as ""The Silver Fox"" spent a good part of his life in a storage room, surrounded by shoulder pads and helmets that emanated odors only a coach could savor.Dewey Guerra would squint at 8 mm game film  flickering black-and-white images of blocking and tackling  projected onto a wall. This was his pleasure zone in the 1960s and early '70s at Cordova High School. With attention to detail, Guerra, who died Thursday at age 85, created the region's greatest football dynasty, the Big Red Machine.His legacy still resonates.Guerra battled health ailments in recent years. In 2010, amid a flood of emotion, he shared how heartsick he felt following the death of his beloved wife, Bonnie, who charted plays with him on scouting trips and was never too far from his side.""What a great man and a great coach,"" said Cordova baseball coach Guy Anderson, who started coaching the Lancers in the 1960s. ""The Silver Fox  that name fit, and I have such nice memories of him in that storage room with film, taping it when it broke. 'Look at the guard there!' If there was a basic, standard mold of a football coach, how to do it the right way, it was Dewey Guerra.""Anderson said he admired how Guerra used simple dive plays and discipline to create the Lancers' legacy.""He's the father of some of the best football this area has seen,"" Anderson said.Guerra took a chance in 1963 and struck gold. He left his state-ranked Folsom High program to take on the challenge of a new school  Cordova. Guerra proudly boasted over the decades that he bought the 12th house built in Rancho Cordova, on a cul-de-sac not too far from the football field.Guerra was in the eye of the perfect storm at Cordova. The Lancers had a dream coaching staff, including Max Miller, Tom Doherty and Ron Lancaster. Nearby Mather Air Force Base produced scores of military sons, including Jerry Manuel, who at Cordova became an All-America flanker in 1971 before a major league baseball career. Mitchell and Mills middle schools were feeder programs that played tackle football.The Lancers went 1-8-1 in their first varsity season in 1963. By 1965, the Lancers found their stride. They led the nation in victories in the 1970s at 106-7-1 and produced a still-standing Sac-Joaquin Section record 28 consecutive winning seasons, through 1993.Guerra introduced the region to the wishbone, a power run game made even better with a speed element. He was known to lean against goal posts and study practice, inhaling a cigarette, barking, ""Come on, baby!""Guerra's 1975 team was the first in Northern California to finish No. 1 in the country. More recently, De La Salle in Concord became the second.Guerra's 11-0 team that season was his last at Cordova. It featured quarterback Scott Jenner and running backs Max Venable, Jeff Allen and Reggie Young.Guerra coached several seasons at American River College before retiring, but he always kept an eye on the Lancers.Lancaster took over at Cordova and won four section titles. Miller took over in 1981 and led the section in victories the next 10 seasons with 108, including the section's first 14-0 team in 1985. Doherty won championships at Folsom and is that school's winningest coach. Miller, Lancaster and Doherty, all retired, say Guerra was their mentor.""Dewey took us all under his wing,"" Miller said. ""He said running the ball was the best way to see how tough our guys were and how tough the opponent was. He called me every week, right up to last week with that deep, growly voice, 'Damn it, Max! For cripes sake!' I'm going to really miss those calls."""\u000a

V"MASHHAD, Iran  My 1,700-mile road trip across Iran began with a giddy paean to America, reinforcing my view that at the grass-roots level, this may be the most pro-American nation in the Middle East.""We love America!"" gushed a former military commando, now a clothing seller, my first evening in the spiritual center of Mashhad. He was so carried away that I thought he might hug me, and although he acknowledged that his business was suffering greatly from Western sanctions, he said he blamed his own leaders. ""I can't blame America,"" he said. ""I love America too much."" That was far from a universal view. I encountered many Iranians  especially in the countryside  who strongly support the Iranian authorities and resent what they see as U.S. government bullying. But while Iranians are far from monolithic, one feature was ubiquitous: the warmth of Iranians when they discovered I was American.We passed occasional ""Death to America"" signs, but our trip was slowed by hospitality, for Iranians kept giving us presents or inviting us into their homes. And in the security line to board a flight from Tehran to Mashhad, a Revolutionary Guard said genially, ""We're not supposed to let batteries through, but we'll make an exception for you since you're a foreigner."" The Iranian government gave me a very rare journalist visa, along with permission to drive unescorted across the country on a government-approved route from Mashhad in the east to Tabriz in the west, and back to Tehran. I interviewed people at random along the way, and as far as I could tell I was not tailed. Compared with my last visit, in 2004, people seem more discontented  mainly because of economic difficulties caused in part by Western sanctions. Those sanctions are causing bitter pain, yet a surprising number of Iranians seem to largely blame their own leaders for the woes. Another difference from my last visit: People are more scared now. Iranians feel fairly free to gripe about their leaders, even within earshot of others, yet since the 2009 crackdown there has been a red line: anything approaching activism, including public criticism. One blogger is serving a 15-year prison sentence, and Iranians have been jailed just for giving interviews to foreign journalists. As a result, Iranians are more wary now of being quoted or shown in videos. ""Please don't use the video,"" implored a young man living near the Caspian Sea, after I interviewed him. ""I want to have a future."" One businessman was scathing about the government when we were speaking casually. ""We have a terrible economy, all because of our president,"" he said. Once we pulled out notebook and video camera, however, he began to praise the government. With the camera turned away again, I asked him why he had switched 180 degrees. ""It is not possible to tell the truth in Iran,"" he said, shrugging. It is very difficult to gauge public opinion in an authoritarian country, but it's clear that there are many government supporters, especially among farmers and less-educated workers. ""Iranian people are happy with their leaders,"" Monad Omidvar, a 38-year-old farm laborer, told me as he played marbles with his friends beside the road near Mashhad. He has a ninth-grade education, and his only source of news is the government media. When I asked about human rights activists and members of the Bahai faith who are in prison, he shook his head skeptically. ""I don't think that in our country innocent people go to jail,"" he said. ""They must have done something."" At the other end of the country, a shopkeeper  also with limited education, also reliant on government television for news  told me that ""all the nation backs the leader."" Yet more common were those like the businessman in Adidas sandals and Ray-Ban sunglasses who scoffed, ""The Iranian revolution was a mistake."" Or the separatist in Tabriz who has given up on Iran and wants the northwest of the country to join Azerbaijan. Or the man at a roadside rest stop who sharply criticized America for bullying Iran, but added, ""our leaders have lost their marbles."" Or the woman who has abandoned prayer and religious fasting, explaining, ""The biggest factor that has turned people against Islam is this government.""Indeed, I think that the expressions of love for America reflect, in part, the intuitive embrace by many Iranians of whatever the state media condemn. To me, Iran feels like other authoritarian countries I covered before they toppled. My guess is that the demise of the system is a matter of time  unless there's a war between Iran and the West, perhaps ignited by Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. That, I sense, would provoke a nationalist backlash and rescue the ayatollahs. More on what I found on my journey in forthcoming columns."\u000a

The victory gave the Eagles a 12-1 league record, one game ahead of Jesuit (11-2).Aces Zack Stilwell of Pleasant Grove and Logan James of Jesuit tossed a combined 11 shutout innings before fatigue set in for both, and emotions swung wildly for both squads in the seventh.The Marauders scored five in the top of the seventh off Stilwell, highlighted by Jordan Hanlin's two-run double, for a 5-3 lead. But the Eagles scored three times in the bottom of the inning with two outs after James departed.""Great win,"" Rinaldi said. ""I was so upset for Zack because he pitched so well, worked so hard, but he was happy at the end when we pulled it out. ""This team's been pretty resilient. We played great baseball with a couple of double plays, then the three-run inning to win it.""Today's game is at Jesuit, and Wednesday's regular-season finale is at Pleasant Grove. The league title is there for the taking for the Eagles, Rinaldi said.""For six years, you've got to beat Jesuit to win this league, and now we've got our shot,"" Rinaldi said.Mom madness  Allison Mason has a hard time relaxing during Placer games, particularly when her son is pitching.On Thursday, Allison paced anxiously or ducked into the snack bar while peeking to watch Ryan overcome a slow start to strike out nine batters in the final four innings against Lincoln, and then win it 5-4 with a bloop single to tighten the Pioneer Valley League race.""I know it kills Mom, these kinds of games,"" said a grinning Ryan Mason, who will attend Cal on scholarship.

V"New Orleans-based, funk-infused jam band Galactic is in Lawrence, Kan., when lead vocalist Corey Glover (of Living Colour fame) calls and reports that the band covets the warmer climes of California. Galactic's ""Freeze Out"" tour has taken it from its annual all-night Mardi Gras party at legendary NOLA club Tipitina's through the ice tray known as the Midwest.The band will be in the Golden State soon enough: Galactic plays Harlow's nightclub on Tuesday night.The band, formed in 1984, performs and records as a high-energy quintet with a wide array of visiting musicians and musical influences, and Brooklyn-bornGlover has been the main guest vocalist since 2010.Glover, 48, started singing at age 6 in church and school choirs. In 1985, the aspiring actor and musician was asked to sing ""Happy Birthday"" at a friend's party. Guitarist Vernon Reid was there and drafted him into Living Colour, which evolved into the Grammy Award-winning African American rock band whose debut 1988 album ""Vivid"" went multiplatinum.Glover's acting rsum includes roles in Oliver Stones' ""Platoon"" and on stage in ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" He has recorded solo albums and will be at the Fillmore in San Francisco in March as part of Living Colour's tour to celebrate the 25th anniversary of ""Vivid,"" which that band will play in its sequential entirety, beginning with the hit ""Cult of Personality."" How did a Brooklyn rocker wind up in a funk-jazz New Orleans band?The whole thing with Galactic is we have mutual friends, mutual interests. We all like the same kind of music and it just manifests itself in many different ways. I watched a video of you and the band covering Led Zeppelin's ""How Many More Times."" Does Galactic do any Living Colour tunes?We do a few, but for the most (part) we're doing Galactic (material).For your 2012 solo album ""The Pledge"" you used crowd sourcing via the PledgeMusic site. How did that work out?Excellently. Part of what they do is give a portion of proceeds to charitable organizations  Doctors Without Borders, Wildlife Fund  but I decided to give it to one I worked with more than once, called NY2NO (the New York 2 New Orleans Coalition).What was it like sharing a foxhole with Charlie Sheen in 1986's ""Platoon""?It was three months of my life that I'll never forget. Johnny Depp. Forest Whitaker. They were also in the foxhole with me.Because of your acting, many people thought you were Danny Glover's son. You're not, but do people still ask you about that ? Absolutely. If your name is Glover, I guess that's what you're going to get. Maybe I should have changed my name.A few years ago, you played Judas in a national tour of ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" Did you build up a lot of bad karma betraying Jesus eight to 10 times a week for nearly two years? No, no, no. That show is, like, my favorite. Part of the reason I wanted to sing rock music was from seeing ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and Carl Anderson doing what he does in it. For Living Colour's ""Vivid"" 25th anniversary tour, are you going to break out the neon wet suit from the ""Cult of Personality"" video?I doubt it. It's way back in my closet. I don't know if I can move back all that stuff to get it.When that video came out, your hair received a lot of attention. Do you miss your dreadlocks?No. When I first decided to do that to my hair, it was an effort to hide. Like, if I'm not doing this well enough  I'm not confident enough  I could always hide behind my hair. Seriously. When I got rid of it all, it was a sign of acceptance of myself, more than anything else.Nothing says acceptance quite like being included in a popular video game. Have you ever played ""Cult of Personality"" on ""Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock""?Yes.How did you do?I suck at it.

V"Enough to make a year's worth of payments on a small car. Enough to take a weeklong vacation for two in Hawaii. Enough to feed a family of three for almost six months.That's the cost of tax increases for middle-class families in Sacramento and elsewhere next year if the government goes permanently off the so-called ""fiscal cliff.""The fiscal cliff is a series of tax increases and spending cuts that will go into effect on Tuesday unless Congress and the president agree to stop some or all of them. The nation's leaders created the cliff during a previous fiscal crisis as a way of motivating Democrats and Republicans to agree on reducing the federal budget deficit.A Sacramento family earning the median household income for the region  about $55,000  would likely pay an additional $2,200 to $3,500 in taxes next year if the cuts and taxes go into effect, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.The full extent of those tax hikes wouldn't be felt unless all of 2013 passed without a deal. But each day without an agreement makes it more likely that families will have to cough up at least a little extra to the federal government.""Even if they work something out, most people agree that taxes are going to increase,"" said Cynthia S. Myers, a certified financial planner based in Sacramento.The cost of the fiscal cliff for local families will depend on their income level; whether they have children; whether they have a job; whether they have investment income; whether they are married and, most importantly, when  or if  leaders agree to mitigate some of the consequences.Congress and the president could reach agreement early next year and make the terms of their deal retroactive, erasing or greatly reducing the cost of planned tax increases. Or they could argue long enough that retroactive action isn't feasible.""It makes it very difficult to plan for 2013,"" said Terri Davis, a Sacramento-based certified public accountant.A few elements would bite quickly if Congress doesn't craft a deal.Since early in the recession, the federal government has taken 2 percent less from wages in payroll taxes used to fund entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. On Jan. 1, that cut ends, forcing a family with $50,000 in annual earnings to pay about $1,000 extra in new taxes during the year.Another near-immediate effect would occur when about 400,000 Californians stop receiving unemployment checks, according to the state Employment Development Department. These are people who have collected unemployment checks beyond the standard 26 weeks.Also, many more people, including thousands of local middle-class residents, will likely have to pay something called the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, if Congress does not act soon.The AMT was designed to make the wealthy pay a minimum amount in taxes instead of using deductions to whittle their bill down to a piddly sum. But, without a congressional fix, many more people who take deductions will pay the AMT on their 2012 income. Congress would have to act fast to stop that from happening, because people start filing tax returns in January.""That could be significant,"" Davis said. ""It could even affect people with around $45,000 in income.""If there isn't a deal by the end of 2013, nearly every household will see income tax rates rise to levels last seen in the 1990s. Those with children will likely see smaller tax credits. Those with investment income will likely pay higher capital gains taxes.Jorge Reyes, a 39-year-old, part-time support-service caregiver, doesn't want any of that to happen. He makes about $1,200 a month  and says he needs every penny to make ends meet.""We're all struggling right now,"" said Reyes, a lifelong Sacramento resident. ""It's going to get worse.""Stan Cray, a 45-year-old mechanical engineer, has two children and didn't like hearing about planned reductions to child tax credits.""I'm just trying to make it as it is,"" said Cray, who lives in Sacramento. ""With extra taxes, it wouldn't be good at all.""Matt Haney, executive director of the University of California Students Association, said he is concerned about the expiration of a tax credit for families that provides up to $2,500 per college student.""Students have been squeezed and squeezed in California for the last few years,"" he said, adding that the expiring credit ""could impact an estimated 1 million taxpayers.""Beyond tax consequences, lack of a deal could hurt the regional and national economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office cautions the results could lead to another recession, which would affect everything from employment to real estate in the Sacramento region.The spending cuts would also hurt. Much of those cuts would focus on the defense industry, and Sacramento is within an hour's drive of two large military bases. Expiring tax credits for research and development would be felt heavily from Folsom to the Bay Area. And tens of thousands of federal workers who could be affected by cuts live and work in California.""We have a lot at stake,"" said Linda Snchez, a Democratic congresswoman representing part of Los Angeles. ""If (spending cuts) go into effect, the results are going to be really devastating."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/05/18/4499031/prep-baseball-playoffs-elk-groves.html,"David Smith suspected he might get some work Thursday night, but not with this sort of entry and these results.When Elk Grove High School starter Rowdy Tellez walked off the mound with a sore left elbow after hyperextending it in a fall earlier in the week, Smith was summoned.The 6-foot-3 junior with a breaking pitch, changeup and fastball calmly delivered one of the most memorable efforts in Sac-Joaquin Section Division I North playoff history, combining with Tellez on an unusual no-hitter to beat Napa 1-0 at Sacramento City College.Tellez recorded one out before switching to first base. From there, it was a duel with Napa's Brett Obranovich, who came in 10-1 and allowed two hits before departing in the seventh. Smith struck out nine and walked two, then worked over a lollipop after the game to ease his nerves.""I didn't expect this,"" said Smith, who improved to 6-0 and moved the Thundering Herd into Saturday's double-elimination round against Delta Valley Conference rival Franklin.Elk Grove coach Jeff Carlson said he has ""never been more nervous than that last inning; I wanted him to have (that no-hitter) so bad. It's crazy. It's not how I drew it up. I can't say enough about David and his composure.""Nick Madrigal scored in the first inning on a Dom Nunez infield groundout. Madrigal had walked and reached third on a wild pitch.Tellez could return to the mound Saturday.Davis 5, Oak Ridge 2 at Sac City  Ben Eckels struck out 12, and catcher George Hatamiya had a leadoff single in honor of his late mother as the Blue Devils knocked out the third and final Delta River League heavyweight from the tournament. Pleasant Grove and Jesuit lost openers on Wednesday.Eckels pitched what he and coach Dan Ariola deemed his best game of the season. Hatamiya's mother, Nancy, died Tuesday after a year-long battle with lung cancer. She pleaded with her son to continue playing. Joe Murray had two hits and one RBI, Chris Gnos had three hits and drove in a run, Bobby Young had an RBI double, and Eckels and John Ariola each had RBIs for Davis, which plays Vacaville on Saturday at noon.""That's why I'm out here because mom wanted me to play, and I needed to play,"" Hatamiya said. ""Feels good to win this.""Said Ariola, ""We wanted to win it for Nancy, and Ben was in control, outstanding.""Rocklin 1, Rosemont 0 at American River College  Tanner McVey struck out 11, allowed two hits and overcame three Thunder errors in a Division II opener. Christian Bennett had two of Rocklin's five hits, including driving in Jake Faulkner in the fifth. Faulkner had doubled with two outs. McVey struck out the last batter in the fourth after his only walk. Rosemont's Sam Long allowed five hits and walked two.Woodcreek 4, Bella Vista 0 at American River  Stephen Nogosek struck out 10 and allowed three hits to eliminate the Broncos in another D-II opener.Placer 12, River Valley 1 at Dan McAuliffe Ballparks  A.J. Sanchez slugged a grand slam, Kevin Giles had four RBIs, and Ryan Mason allowed two hits, walked two and struck out nine for the Hillmen in a Division III opener. Mason, the Cal-bound senior ace, also had two hits."\u000a

V"Esther Higgwe hopes to use track and field as a springboard to bigger things.Her goal is to earn a college scholarship, become a pediatrician and return to her native Nigeria to open a hospital.The Monterey Trail High School senior sprinter's performance in Saturday's star-studded 32nd annual Sacramento Meet of Champions at American River College can only help.Higgwe won the girls 100- and 200-meter races and anchored Monterey Trail's winning 4x100 relay to win the Girls Track Athlete of the Meet award.""I'm so excited right now,"" Higgwe said after running a personal-best 11.86 seconds in the 100. ""I've been trying to break 12 seconds for so long.""Higgwe's time pushed her to No. 5 in the state 100 rankings.Higgwe credited a strong start  ""I stayed down instead of popping right up""  and a relaxed finish in edging Cosumnes Oaks freshman Natsumi Mcgee, who also cracked the 12-second barrier in 11.97.Higgwe won the 200 in 24.50 to move to No. 8 in California. Her strong anchor leg helped Monterey Trail to a time of 47.43 in the 4x100, sixth best in the state.Higgwe moved from Nigeria to the United States when she was 6 years old. She closely watches the economic struggles of her native country and hopes to give back.That's why she maintains good grades and can't wait to get to college. She has an official visit scheduled next weekend at UC Riverside and plans a visit to Cal later in the season.""Track isn't my only passion,"" Higgwe said. ""I sing, I draw, I dance.""But I want to become a doctor. Whatever medical degree I do receive, I plan to go back and open a hospital because I know what is lacking there is good medical care.""Higgwe's performance was one of many highlights of the fast- moving and efficient meet. Among them: National leader Gabby Williams of Reed in Sparks, Nev., won the girls high jump in 5 feet, 11 inches, breaking the oldest girls Meet of Champions record and sharing Girls Field Athlete of the Meet honors. Woodland's J.C. Broughton leaped 5-10 in 1989. Reed, a sophomore who has a season best of 6 feet, failed in her attempts to clear 6-1. National triple jump leader Sasha Wallace, a junior from Holy Names of Oakland, easily won that event at 41-8 3/4 to share Girls Field Athlete of the Meet honors. More impressive was her win in the 100 hurdles that featured four of the top eight in California. She won in 13.62, nosing out Sac-Joaquin Section leader Daje Puge of Fairfield (13.73). UCLA football scholarship signee and state leader Kenneth Walker III of Kennedy in Richmond had a high and low in the boys 110 hurdles. He thought he had bettered his state-leading time of 14.05, only to learn that his 13.75 was wind-aided. Walker won the 300 hurdles in 38.14 and anchored Kennedy's winning boys 4x100 relay to earn Boys Track Athlete of the Meet recognition. San Leandro's Andre McBride won the boys 200 in a state-leading 21.204, edging Colony of Ontario's Kyree King (21.210). King won the 100 in 10.54 to tie for the state lead. Oakdale's Manny Hernandez won the high jump in 6-9, edging second-place Londeen Mccovery of Cosumnes Oaks and third-place Noel Frazier of California in San Ramon on jumps. Monterey Trail's William Reyes won the boys 3,200 in 9:24.75 and Vista del Lago's Clare Carroll the girls 3,200 in 10:45.90. Davis' Jack Scranton won the 1,600 in 4:16.53. Bear River's Kendal Nielsen won the girls long jump in 19-1 3/4 and placed third in the triple jump at 38-5 3/4. Ponderosa's Alison Ryan won the girls shot put at 41-9."\u000a

That's one reason why she will be in Carson City, Nev., next week.Poundstone is the national spokeswoman for the Association of Library Trustees, Advocates, Friends and Foundations, which supports libraries as social and intellectual centers. Poundstone works to raise awareness and funds through her stand-up shows, such as the one set next Friday at the Bob Boldrick Theater in Carson City.""It's funny that we think of libraries as quiet, demure places where we are shushed by dusty, bun- balancing, bespectacled women,"" Poundstone said. ""The truth is that libraries are raucous clubhouses for free speech, controversy and community.""Libraries can never be shushed. Of course, I'm not saying there are people in there shouting, but the atmosphere is certainly not as buttoned-down as it used to be. After all, I go to libraries, and I can't shut up to save my life.""Poundstone is quick to point out that though many people think ""libraries may be going obsolete,"" she does not think that.""They will have to change, but awareness is rising of their worth,"" she said. ""People say (libraries) get all their money from taxes, but that has not been true. They get much of it from fund-raising, from friends-of-the-library associations.""You can even find a book by Poundstone  ""There's Nothing in This Book That I Meant to Say""  in libraries.

V"Jack Gallagher specializes in both transparency and personal oral history. That he adds funny details, layering into his stories measured moments of sentimentality without becoming self-indulgent, makes him a master of his craft. The writer-performer puts this all on display in his appealing new one-man show, ""Complete and Unfinished,"" which had its world premiere Sunday night at the B Street Theatre.This is the fifth in a series of autobiographical one-man plays Gallagher has written, beginning with ""Letters to Declan"" (1993), followed by ""Just the Guy"" (2002), ""What He Left"" (2006) and ""A Different Kind of Cool""(2010). Here Gallagher, with co- directors Buck Busfield and Jerry Montoya, gives the new work a meta-theatrical frame that shows him building the play by brainstorming ideas on a set that resembles his home office.Staring at an empty bulletin board, Gallagher starts throwing out ideas that he writes on color-coded index cards and tacks on the board, hitting upon the twin constants in his life: music and home. The device works in fits and starts, but pales in comparison with a more organic sense of story Gallagher delivers in the play.The former stand-up comic talks about turning 60 this year and the fact that more of life is behind him than in front of him. He's come to a point where he's looking at how he got to where he is rather than planning where he's going. It's a poignant and powerful moment that could have logically ordered the loosely connected, cross-cutting memories that flood the two-act play. As it is, Gallagher moves through major moments in his life, creating a rough chronology beginning with his Irish American heritage in Massachusetts. There are amusing riffs on Catholicism and his immersion in the small Irish community in which he grew up. Then he mines one of the play's richest themes  his ongoing love of popular music. Gallagher talks about sitting at his father's feet in their darkened living room, listening to Andy Williams, Tony Bennett and other popular singers of the day. He discovers 45s, then eventually LPs. Gallagher basks in the familiar sequences of songs that become imbedded in his consciousness, like the memorable flow of music on the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's"" album. Gallagher reveals himself as true aficionado, studying liner notes and digging into the artistry of Michael Nesmith, Gram Parsons and Steely Dan. After high school and a dalliance at community college, Gallagher took off on a see-the-country road trip with a friend. While the trip's adventures and mishaps make up an entertaining chunk of the first act, it's the end of the trip that galvanizes the play. On his first day back home he meets Jean Ellen Dunn, the woman who will become his wife.""Jean Ellen was the first person I could tell everything in the world to,"" Gallagher says.In the second half of the play, Gallagher relates his development as a comedian and his rise to national prominence with the support and inspiration of his wife. The strands of stories come and go, with Gallagher's affability and storytelling skills not just holding the play together, but giving a certain emotional coherence to the ideas. In the end, Gallagher circles back to familiar themes of fatherhood and family, engaging the audience with his moving sense of honesty and emotion as he deals with the ""random events"" of his life.COMPLETE AND UNFINISHED   What: Jack Gallagher's new one-man showWhen: 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays; 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays; 5 and 9 p.m. Saturdays; 2 p.m. Wednesdays and Sundays, through Feb. 24Where: B Street Theatre Mainstage, 2711 B St., SacramentoTickets: $23-$35, $5 studentsRunning time: 2 hours and 15 minutes including one intermission.Information: (916) 443-5300, www.bstreettheatre.org"\u000a

V"Folsom's Jake Browning, Vista del Lago's Matt Jimison and Oak Ridge's Jason Samuels are among the Sac-Joaquin Section's most successful and prolific passers this season.But up the hill in nearby Shingle Springs, Ponderosa's Jake Bist also is having an impact season for the 5-1 Bruins.The senior has completed 84 of 135 passes for 1,120 yards and 12 touchdowns against only one interception for a 115 quarterback rating through six games. He's a big reason the Bruins have a shot at making the playoffs for the first time since 2007.""We haven't had that super, amazing quarterback,"" said senior linebacker-fullback Jeff Camilli, explaining Ponderosa's 7-23 overall record the past three seasons. ""Jake was a little shaky last year (a QB rating of 65). But he worked his butt off this offseason, and it's paying off. We have so much more confidence that we can put up points when we have to because of Jake.""Following Saturday's 17-3 Delta River League win over Jesuit, the Bruins have scored 244 points.Last year, the Bruins scored 136 points in 10 games, albeit against a much tougher schedule that included nonleague losses to Elk Grove, Nevada Union and Rocklin.This season, the Bruins are a last-second field goal (a 15-13 loss to then-No. 16 Rio Linda on Sept. 28) from being 6-0.""When we had our coaches meeting, I told them we were the only team from our league last year not to go to the postseason,"" said Ponderosa coach Jason Tenner. ""I told them we are going to join them this year. Obviously, beating Jesuit is a huge step in that direction.""The Bruins continue league play at home Friday against No. 8 Pleasant Grove.

Deren, Derek, Dion and Kevin all were contributors for the Spartans.Deandre isn't too bad, either. The junior is one of the team's top rushers and tacklers. He's an every-down player for a 3-3 Spartans team with a roster of 18.Hibbard has eight players starting on both sides of the ball.""We're hanging in there,"" said Hibbard, who offers a study hall with a well-stocked refrigerator. ""I keep feeding them lunch so the kids are keeping their grades up. We're trying to have fun.""Positive approach  Rio Americano senior Jordan Vinson probably didn't realize how quickly his words would become reality under Max Miller and his new staff.""I'm excited to be with this coaching staff,"" Vinson said last week on the first day of practice under Miller, who was hired to replace ousted coach Christian Mahaffey. ""Great things are going to happen here.""Great things happened for Vinson in Friday's 30-6 win over Cordova in a Capital Athletic League opener.Miller moved the 6-3, 200-pound senior from offensive guard to running back, and he responded by rushing for 288 yards and three touchdowns.Poole honored  Oakmont's first football coach and athletic director, Glenn Poole, was honored during the Vikings' 24-20 homecoming loss against Christian Brothers last Friday night.Poole participated in the pregame coin flip and was presented with a commemorative photo taken of Poole and his wife, Shirley, the night of the Vikings' first football championship in 1969.Poole also was Colfax's first football coach in the early 1960s."\u000a

V"PASCAGOULA, Miss.  Oil residue from the BP spill is still being hauled off by the truckload each day from the beaches of the barrier islands off the Mississippi Gulf coast.In fact, it is likely more oil tar has been cleaned from the islands in the fall and winter than at the height of the spill last summer, because larger crews of BP workers can now get to the beaches and inlets. They had been restricted to foot traffic while birds and turtles were nesting.Terry Morris, a spokesman for the Gulf Islands National Seashore, said they even have been able to use beach-cleaning machinery on some of the island beaches this fall to expedite the cleanup. But they arent using anything as intrusive as they have used on the popular public beaches of the mainland, because the islands beaches are more environmentally sensitive.  The islands, 11 miles out, got more oil than the mainland of Mississippi. They were the first line of defense, Morris said. Theres an awful lot of oil product being picked up.During the height of the spill, birds and turtles were nesting on the tips of the islands so BP could run only small work crews. It couldnt risk disturbing the nests or killing the eggs, Morris said.It wasnt until late August or September that crews of 80 to 150 could hit the islands and cleanup there could begin in earnest. In September, tar- and oil-debris recovery from the islands of Petit Bois, Horn, Cat and East and West Ship hit 2 million pounds, or 1,000 tons. Since then, the amount has likely doubled, officials said. According to BP figures, since June crews have recovered 1.38 million pounds from Horn alone and 1.16 million pounds from Petit Bois, the two islands officially designated national wilderness areas. The total from all the islands is 2.94 million pounds.In comparison, crews on the mainland have gleaned 372,000 pounds since June, the most coming from Harrison County with 198,000 pounds and Jackson County with 139,400 pounds, according to figures supplied by BP spokesman Ray Melick this week.Some of whats being recovered on the island beaches has been there since the summer, buried by sand and uncovered by the strong north winds of fall and winter.Some of it is tar patties continuing to wash up from the Gulf as part of the 84 million gallons the government estimates remain of the more than 200 million gallons that gushed from the crippled well in the months after the April 20 disaster. On Thursday, a crew of 80 on Horn Island uncovered a tar patty 3 inches thick and 4 to 5 feet long, park rangers said. On Tuesday, BP said crews picked up more than a ton on Horn Island and eight tons on Petit Bois.Morris said when Tropical Storm Bonnie entered the Gulf in late July, it sent 6- to 10-foot waves containing oil debris crashing onto the south beaches of the islands.It drove the tar high on the beaches and were still dealing with that today, he said.  Crews leave an area clean one day, and wind uncovers more to clean up the next. Or they find more as they dig deeper.Whats crucial at this point is crews get as much tar off the islands as possible, without damaging the beaches, before the bird-nesting season begins again in March, Morris said. Colonies of snowy plovers, least terns, gulls and black skimmers will begin arriving in mid-March for courting and nesting, and the cleanup will have to be scaled back, he said.The birds will arrive by the thousands and nest mostly on the tips of the islands.Theyre so far out, most people dont know about these nesting colonies, Morris said. But sections of the islands will be closed to all foot traffic.BPs Melick said they expect to be cleaning island beaches through the summer. Any longer than that, we just dont know, he said.But there will come a time when the federal government, with the help of Mississippis Department of Marine Resources, will define clean.At some point theyll have to come up with a designation of clean, because theyll never get it all, Horn Island ranger Ben Moore said. And at some point, digging up oil (tar) will be more detrimental to the island environment than leaving whats there."\u000a

With two children (Lucas, 6, and Ava, 4) from Stacie's previous marriage, Hibbs admits priorities have changed.""Can you believe it, 46 years old and having twins?"" Hibbs said at the recent Father Kelly Tribute at Jesuit. ""I go from having zero kids to having four. It's been crazy.""Now Hibbs, a stickler for details, has forgotten to bring the scorebook to games several times.""Before, it was basketball all the time,"" Hibbs said.

The Mustangs also beat Bear River 47-31 Tuesday.""I ask our players about their legacy  are they going to be the first team not to make the playoffs?"" said Hibbs, whose 15 previous Foothill teams reached the postseason.

V"Akiem Hicks embarked on what he called ""a crazy, wild, unpredictable ride"" of a football journey. His path to the NFL was hardly direct, with detours taking the defensive lineman from Del Campo High School to Sacramento City College, LSU, Regina University in Canada, then to bedlam at home in Elk Grove on Friday night with a draft call.A third-round pick by the New Orleans Saints, Hicks highlighted an impressive haul of local talent that will soon report for work.On Saturday, pals Devon Wylie and Miles Burris from Granite Bay High School followed through on a pact they had made in childhood: to make the NFL. Wylie, a wide receiver from Fresno State, was picked in the fourth round by Kansas City. Burris, a linebacker out of San Diego State, went in the same round to the Raiders, meaning that for the first time, they might have to tackle each other. The Raiders and Chiefs represent one of football's storied rivalries.In the fifth round, defensive back Asa Jackson from Christian Brothers and Cal Poly went to the Ravens, and linebacker Josh Kaddu from Vacaville and Oregon was picked by the Dolphins. In the sixth round, cornerback Isaiah Frey from Jesuit and Nevada was tabbed by Chicago, where his teammate will be six-time Pro Bowl linebacker Lance Briggs of Elk Grove.Burris fielded his draft call at his family home in Granite Bay, where family members erupted when they heard the news. Burris grew up as a Raiders fan and said he can still use his drawer full of Silver and Black items. He set tackling records at Granite Bay and led San Diego State in stops in each of his final two seasons.Hicks, the Saints' first pick, said he cannot get over the euphoria of his journey. He admitted he was not the best student at Del Campo, nor was he the most mature young man when he played at Sac City. But he grew in bulk and as a man, his coaches and family members said. His football ability made Hicks a hot prospect in college and during NFL workouts.Hicks didn't play at LSU, where he was sidelined by recruiting violations that included an excessive number of phone calls from coaches to him. He wound up at Regina and feared he might never get on the NFL radar.Hicks dominated East-West Shrine Game practices, and in the game, he manhandled foes by showcasing remarkable agility and speed at 6-foot-5 and 320 pounds.""My head coaches in Mike Dimino at Del Campo and Dannie Walker at Sac City told me that I'd get knocked down in this game, but it was up to me to get up with fire, be better than before, and I have,"" Hicks said. ""I'm a different man now, all grown up, ready to go. As for my journey, it's been a long one, and it's been a rough one, but it's been worth it.""Said Walker, the Sac City coach: ""Akiem had the willpower and pride to stick with this. I got a lot of calls from NFL people. I told them that Akiem's a high-character guy. He can move ridiculously well, just an amazing athlete, a big-time freak of nature. Sky really is the limit for him, and we just talked that he is now officially living the dream. Take advantage of it."""\u000a

V"Disappointment with how his beloved soccer field was allowed to deteriorate during the summer led to Ashley Yudin's decision to resign following 19 seasons and much success as the Davis High School boys coach.""I knew this was going to be my last year, and I was planning on making an announcement as the season progressed,"" Yudin said. ""But when the condition of the field nose-dived, I just felt it was time to let somebody else be the coach. I'm 64. It's time.""Davis athletic director Dennis Foster said veteran junior varsity coach Alex Park will be the interim varsity coach this season and former varsity assistant coach Jason dal Porto will become the interim JV coach.Yudin, a Texas native who was a longtime research associate at UC Davis, is a coaching icon in the Davis soccer community.His Davis boys teams earned six Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championships, including last fall's 5-3 penalty-kick win over rival Jesuit. He also coached the Davis girls program from 1993 to 1998.But when Yudin Field was temporarily closed Aug. 1 after much of the grass had died because of irrigation problems and nearby construction, Yudin said it was time to move his retirement up a season.""It was just the perfect storm as far as things that could go wrong,"" Yudin said. ""  Watching that field die was heartbreaking to me.""In the short term, while school district crews work to try to make Yudin Field playable again, Foster says the boys team will practice off campus at Nugget Field in East Davis. Some games may be played at the football stadium, which has synthetic turf.Yudin, who started his career at Davis High in 1986 as an assistant girls coach, says he will continue to coach youth teams while serving as director of coaching of the Davis Legacy Soccer Club.Girls up, boys down  Girls' participation in high school sports continues to grow in California, but boys' participation has declined for the first time since 2003, according to the latest CIF sports participation survey.Girls' participation climbed 1.4 percent from 304,696 in 2011 to 308,879 in 2012. Boys' participation decreased 0.9 percent from 453,037 in 2011 to 448,971 in 2012.Eleven-man football remains the most popular boys sport with 103,088 participants but has seen a steady decline since reaching its high point of 107,916 in 2007.Track and field continues to be the top girls sport with 43,727, a decline of 2 percent from 2011 after several years of sizable growth. Soccer is a close second with 43,391 participants, a 1.6 percent increase.Basketball saw the largest increase for both boys (43,989, up 1.9 percent) and girls (35,133, up 7 percent) among the CIF's top 10 sports.Track saw the biggest decrease for both boys (54,319, down 6.2 percent) and girls (43,727, down 2 percent).Wimbley signs  Recent Pleasant Grove graduate Marissa Wimbley, a Bee All-Metro first-team girls basketball selection, has signed an NCAA letter of intent with Hawaii.The 5-foot-6 point guard's steady play  14.8 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.3 steals per game  helped the Eagles win the Delta River League championship and finish 22-10 overall.Wimbley also was Pleasant Grove's Female Athlete of the Year for 2011-12 and one of the school's top 15 senior students."\u000a

V"Sprawled on all fours, gassed from having wrestled seven deadlocked minutes with the defending state heavyweight champion, Foothill High School senior Michael Lowman said to himself: ""This is it.""Lowman, the state's third-ranked 285-pounder, had taken top-ranked Nick Nevills of Clovis into overtime of the semifinals at the CIF State Championship meet at Bakersfield's Rabobank Arena on March 3.With five other matches taking place simultaneously, all eyes seemed to be on Lowman and Nevills on Mat 5. The crowd oohed, ahhed and gasped with every move.""I'm thinking, 'Go for it now, or lose,' "" Lowman said.He began the double-overtime period in the down position with the hulking Nevills on top controlling one arm. Lowman then hit a ""switch""  raising the arm Nevills was grasping, rolling out of it to a sitting position and gaining control  earning him the decisive two points for a reversal. After riding out the final 30 seconds Lowman handed Nevills, only a sophomore, his first high school loss.When Lowman (47-3) finished runner-up in the state championship match, his efforts this season earned him The Bee's Wrestler of the Year honors.""It was an incredible run for him,"" Foothill coach Bill Lum said. ""He kept exceeding what people thought of him."" But to comprehend the accomplishment and its significance, it is first necessary to grasp Lowman's background, and his view of himself.""I see myself as the underdog  no one expects me to do anything,"" said Lowman, the first Foothill wrestler to place in the state meet. ""I'm out to show people that I'm not the worst, and if you catch me on the right day, I can beat anybody.""Many high school wrestlers who reach the final day of the season  the top 4 percent in California  have been wrestling since middle school, if not earlier.What's more, those wrestlers are often trained in feeder programs  similar to youth football  that begin as early as first grade, learning from the same coaches they will have in high school.That applies to Nevills, who comes from a wrestling family, and state champion Johnny Schupp of Vacaville, who pinned Lowman at the Doc Buchanan Invitational in Clovis in January and during their state championship match.Lowman began wrestling in high school. Foothill is just now establishing its feeder program through Foothill Ranch Middle School.""That gives me the drive to let people know that my coaches are some of the best around,"" Lowman said. ""Through me, I feel like I can help people see that coach Lum and coach (Bret) Friend are good coaches; they just don't get recognized the way they should.""After playing on the junior varsity football team as a freshman, Lowman was approached by a coach with an ultimatum: If he hoped to play football as a sophomore, Lowman would have to wrestle. With no experience but eager to satisfy his coach, Lowman obliged. Despite enjoying the new sport immediately, success came slowly.""He was a big, goofy, uncoordinated guy,"" teammate Alden Bradley said. ""His first year, he made a lot of mistakes and lost a lot of matches that he probably shouldn't have.""Lowman returned for his sophomore year with a renewed vigor. A strong showing at an early-season tournament was the turning point.""That's when everyone started taking him seriously,"" Bradley said.As his stature in the wrestling community continued to grow, so too did his presence on the Foothill Farms campus. Standing 6-foot-8, Lowman is hard to miss  even in a crowd of 1,500 students. It's not his size that those who first meet him notice  it's his smile.""He's a big teddy bear,"" Bradley said. ""He knows everybody and everybody loves him.""Lowman qualified for the Sac-Joaquin Section Masters meet that sophomore season, going 2-2. He placed third as a junior and qualified for the state championships, where he was 2-2 before suffering a leg injury.This season, he ran roughshod through the area's heavyweights, winning four regular-season tournaments, including the Foothill-hosted Tim Brown Memorial for a second consecutive year.""Even at this level, he's 100 percent coachable,"" Friend said. ""That's what makes him so good  he does whatever we ask him to do."""\u000a

""Twenty-three shutouts in 29 games is pretty good.""All-Delta River League stopper Riley Harbour and back Evan Glass, both seniors, led a stellar defensive group that included juniors Anthony Ayala, Andrew Gosselin, Matt Nemeth, John Bovill, Kannon Kuhn and sophomore keeper Luc Barbe.In all, Jesuit allowed eight goals while scoring 120, led by Niko Hansen, Kaba Alkebulan and Evan Barrett. Alkebulan and Barrett were all-league while Hansen was the league MVP. Hansen, a New Mexico recruit, scored a team-high 35 goals.The only blemishes on Jesuit's record were a 1-1 draw with Granite Bay in the Capital Challenge on Sept. 7 and a 2-0 loss in Oregon on Sept. 13 to Jesuit-Portland.Jesuit, which has won 10 boys section titles, is No. 2 in the National Soccer Coaches Association of America's fall rankings, something Rose has no problem with even though he thinks his team is the nation's best.St. Benedict's Prep of Newark, N.J., (18-0-0) is No. 1 after winning its 24th consecutive New Jersey state championship and extending its consecutive wins steak to 54.""The bottom line is that we shouldn't have tied Granite Bay and shouldn't have lost to Jesuit (of Portland),"" Rose said. "" But those matches also made us more cohesive as a team.""Jesuit outscored four playoff opponents 26-1.

V"Little Peyton Krasner has been through a rough time lately. Last summer he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor behind his left eye and it required months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments.But bathed in beaming sunshine Sunday, the 7-year-old Rocklin boy was squeezed onto a humming motorcycle, his arms clinging tight around his father's waist, his helmeted head leaning on a sturdy back.Father and son left their troubles behind and rolled onto Highway 49 in Auburn in a thick current of black leather and flashes of chrome, part of a wave of thousands of motorcycle riders revving through mountain communities to raise money for the boy's medical bills.Peyton was the star of the 33rd annual Sweetheart Run, organized by longtime Auburn motorcycle shop owners Carlo and Emma Lujan. They predicted the fundraising ride would lure more than 2,500 enthusiasts out of winter hibernation.""It's inspiring,"" said Peyton's mother, Kelly Krasner, watching the throng of riders straddling their idling bikes in the parking lot of the Lujans' store, C Auburn V-Twin. ""For them to make this gesture, it's an honor.""She smiled to see her son at the center of attention. Seasoned riders  many with bushy gray beards, skull-decorated neck scarves and signature sunglasses  stopped to talk to the little guy with a big fight on his hands.The Lujans also were dedicating the ride to the memory of their nephew Joe Pratt, who was killed in September in a vehicle accident caused by a distracted driver. They said they wanted to raise awareness about the dangers of using cellphones while driving.The route took the flock of riders 32 miles from Auburn along surface streets and Highway 49 to the historic Georgetown Hotel, then south to Coloma for a barbecue and music. Riders were charged $5 each, and commemorative pins were sold for $10, with all the proceeds going to the Krasner family.""I've known the Lujans since I was 12 years old,"" said Peyton's father, Jason Krasner. His father once worked for the shop as a service manager.Kelly Krasner said her son came home from school one day in August with a puffy eye. Within days, the eye was almost popping out of its socket, and a biopsy confirmed the parents' fears.Peyton has rhabdomyosarcoma, a rapidly growing soft-cell tumor that wrapped its tentacles around the nerves behind his eye. He had six months of chemotherapy and five weeks of radiation.A scan this week will tell the family if the treatment has licked the tumor or if Peyton needs more treatment.Peyton, a youngster of few words, said he felt good Sunday. Wearing his knit beanie, he was eager to get on the bike with his father, asking him repeatedly when it was time.""He's excited because he found out there's a camp for kids with cancer, and Make-A-Wish (the foundation) has contacted him, so he's focusing on a lot of positive things,"" Kelly Krasner said. ""And he's 7. It's amazing that he can go with it when we're the ones who are crying."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/04/19/4424308/this-quartet-packs-plenty-of-tunes.html,"The solidly entertaining ""Million Dollar Quartet"" is less about the ground-breaking rock 'n' roll stars of the title and more about the man who discovered them.That is not to say you don't get Elvis Presley famously swiveling his hips or Johnny Cash dipping into his regal baritone. Carl Perkins twangs classic guitar licks and Jerry Lee Lewis nearly levitates with his audacious energy. Yet the musical's narrative centers on Sam Phillips, the owner and producer of Sun Records, who is so often cited as making the first rock 'n' roll record, ""Rocket 88,"" in a session featuring 19-year-old guitarist-composer Ike Turner. Book writers Colin Escott and Floyd Mutrux, both experts on the early days of rock 'n' roll, have crafted a story based on the events of Dec. 4, 1956, showing Phillips trying to keep his little record enterprise going. Actor Christopher Ryan Grant's effusive Phillips is a classic American success story. Phillips related to the blues, and seminal artists such as B.B. King and Howlin' Wolf made their first recordings at his little studio. Phillips' modest business becomes the story's fulcrum as both Perkins (Lee Ferris) and Cash (Derek Keeling) are looking for more exposure than Sun Records can give. Perkins had a hit with ""Blue Suede Shoes,"" but Phillips had to sell Presley's contract to RCA Records in 1955 to keep Sun afloat.Even with Perkins and Cash grousing about their career status, the opportunity to hang out at the Sun studio with old friend Presley, now suddenly a star, was too rich to pass up. With young Jerry Lee Lewis (Martin Kaye) on hand, a real jam session took place. Tape was rolling when Presley (Cody Slaughter) and his lady friend, here called Dyanne (Kelly Lamont) dropped in on the Perkins recording session.The four singers concentrated on the gospel standards they grew up on and truly loved, including ""Jesus Walked That Lonesome Valley,"" ""I Shall Not Be Moved"" and ""Just a Little Talk With Jesus.""While those tunes aren't in the musical, ""Peace in the Valley"" and ""Down By the Riverside,"" which they also sang, are included. For the purposes of making this a popular musical experience, many songs in the show weren't sung that day.""Blue Suede Shoes,"" ""Fever,"" ""That's All Right,"" ""Great Balls of Fire,"" ""I Walk the Line"" and ""Folsom Prison Blues"" were not sung that night in 1956, but are in the tight, 95-minute, one-act production. Curiously, Presley's big hit ""Don't Be Cruel,"" which the band actually worked on several times that night, is not included in the show. There is a knowing nod to the influence of Chuck Berry and a spirited performance of his ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man.""With all the music created onstage by the engaging performers (including bassist Chuck Zayas and drummer Billy Shaffer) and their realistic interactions, the passion and power of the era takes over and makes this an absolutely winning production."\u000a

He was 67.Gill was a star athlete at Bishop Armstrong in the early 1960s, playing on the state-ranked 1962 baseball team coached by Dick Sperbeck. Gill graduated from University of San Francisco and started teaching and coaching at Sacred Heart Parish School in Sacramento in the 1960s.Gill taught mostly English at CBS for 39 years, retiring in 2009. He coached CBS to a Sac-Joaquin Section basketball championship over Jesuit in 1978.Gill's greatest joy, he once told The Bee, was coaching his four sons in baseball at CBS  Ed, Dan, Steve and Tom.Said CBS principal Mary Hesser: ""I remember Joe as a humble man who really 'walked the walk' when it came to his integrity and faith. Sometimes I would walk by the chapel at CB and could see through the crack in the door Joe in there on his lunch hour, all alone, praying and meditating. He was a holy man and much admired.

V"For being such a quiet, soft-spoken teenager, Malik Pope is generating plenty of buzz.Pope went from an under-the-radar basketball talent as a sophomore last season at Burbank High School to one of the hottest prospects in the nation after a spring and summer on the Amateur Athletic Union circuit.A rangy, 6-foot-8 small forward with a throwback high flattop that makes him appear even taller, Pope has at least 17 major-college offers, including eight from Pacific-12 Conference schools and basketball powers Kansas, Louisville, Gonzaga and Georgetown.Pope is rated the No. 1 Class of 2014 prospect in Northern California by NorCalPreps.com and No. 9 nationally by Rivals.com., but he said he sometimes feels like a round peg trying to fit into a square hole at Laguna Creek, his new school.""I think it's more about where I'm comfortable,"" Pope said. ""Here, everything's totally different  my schedule, classes, teammates.""Pope's heart strings are still with Burbank, where he played last year with older brothers Remle and Emannuel Pope and close friends Jalen Coates and Clifford Lyles.Burbank coach Lindsey Ferrell misses his big man, and not just because of his basketball talent, which he touted all last season despite Pope's modest stats of 7.8 points and 5.6 rebounds.""Malik is a good kid, a very likable guy,"" Ferrell said. ""We wish nothing but the best for him.""When Pope's mother, Nicole, moved her family to Elk Grove late last spring, she enrolled Malik at Laguna Creek.By the end of the semester, Pope left Laguna Creek and attended a summer school class at Capital Christian and played with the Cougars at a Bay Area camp.But when the fall semester started, Pope was back at Laguna Creek, though it was uncertain if he would play basketball as he worked to improve his grades.""Malik is struggling with the change a little bit, but I understand where my mom is coming from,"" said Emannuel Pope, now a student at Cosumnes River College who keeps a close watch over his 16-year-old brother. ""She wants to make sure he's on the right track as far as grades.""There's been a learning curve with his new teammates, too.Pope is most comfortable playing on the wing, not in the post, but he towers over his teammates. Other than 6-3 junior Cecil Williams II, the other eight Cardinals average about 5-9.So far the marriage has produced mixed results and a 4-3 record for the No. 14 Cardinals.Pope had 33 points and 11 rebounds in a 76-59 win over No. 20 Woodcreek on Dec. 2 and scored 35 points in an 80-66 victory over St. Mary's of Stockton on Dec. 4. But in the team's losses to No. 9 Del Oro, Turlock and Lincoln of Stockton, he has looked out of sync with his teammates and lackadaisical at times. One observer called it ""casual effort.""There is no argument about Pope's raw ability, however. He has hops, can dribble like a guard and shoots feathery rainbows from long distance.""Pope is a talent,"" Woodcreek coach Paul Hayes said. ""He has a devastating crossover, and if he gets within 10 to 12 feet of the basket, he can use his height to get off a jumper with a soft touch. In addition, he also had three threes against us, so you have to guard him on the perimeter, as well.""Laguna Creek coach Paul Casey was expecting a roller coaster ride.Pope has been with his teammates only since the start of practice in early November; Laguna Creek is trying to replace its three graduated top scorers from last season; and Casey will need to integrate three transfers into the rotation when they become eligible in January.""There's some growing pains right now, and we have a lot of work to do because Malik has been with us only a short while,"" Casey said. ""But there's still the potential for a tremendous upside.""Casey has some returning experience with senior guards Kevante Williams, Ladarius Nguyen and Erion Wilder. Cecil Williams, a three-sport standout (football and baseball) with a 4.4 grade-point average, played last season as a sophomore.The easygoing Casey, who started coaching boys basketball in 1978 in San Diego, has had playoff teams. His 2002-03 Valley team, led by Roburt Sallie and Wayne Hunter, won the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I title and reached the CIF Northern California Regional final.But he's never coached a so-young, so-high-profile talent such as Pope, who has had recruiters from more than a dozen colleges drop by to watch him practice and play.""It's exciting,"" Casey said. ""We already had a nice group of kids. Then you add a 6-8 16-year-old who moves like a guard and that makes things really interesting."""\u000a

The county will also purchase a high-efficiency, vacuum-assisted sweeper.""Our choice of sand material was based on a Caltrans study of different abrasives  comparing fine-sediment content and durability,"" said Robert Costa, manager of the county's Department of Public Works.The county's plan is required under a recently updated federal permit regulating storm runoff into the lake. Ongoing since 1992, it is renewed every five years, each time with new requirements, Costa said.Six additional Placer sediment-reduction projects have begun.

V"Western States 2012 will be remembered as the year of records broken, on both timing clocks and thermometers.Cold temperatures at the 39th Western States 100 made for a day of record-breaking times, with six runners finishing under 16 hours for the first time.Fans gathered at the Placer High School finish line Saturday night were shocked when Timothy Olson, 28, of Ashland, Ore., ran the first sub 15-hour 100.2-mile trek from Squaw Valley to Auburn, breaking Geoff Roes' 2010 mark by more than 20 minutes. Olson clocked in at 14 hours, 46 minutes, 44 seconds.Olson regained the lead after the 70.7-mile Peachstone check-in to defeat Ryan Sandes, 30, who rounded the final 300 meters waving his native South African flag.After producing the film ""Unbreakable: The Western States 100"" in 2011, a documentary centered on the top four male finishers, film crews returned to focus on the female runners. With top women shattering two of the oldest records, 2012 proved a great year for a film.The heartiest cheers came when defending champion Ellie Greenwood, 33, of Banff, Alberta, crossed the finish line in 16:47:19 to break Ann Trason's 18-year-old course record by nearly 50 minutes. Greenwood placed 14th overall.Unlike 2011  when Greenwood overtook Kami Semick, who had been delayed in the final miles of the race by a mother bear  Greenwood maintained a convincing lead from the halfway point to win by more than an hour.Second-place Rory Bosio, 27, of Soda Springs also broke a Trason record with an 18:08:06 finish that set a new low for the women's 18-29 age group.Dave Mackey, 42, of Novato, who finished fourth overall, broke Tsuyoshi Kaburaki's 2011 record for the 40-49 age group with a 15:53:36.""This year's 10th-place finisher would have won 32 of the previous 38 races,"" announcer and Western States board of directors trustee John Medinger said.Medinger attributed the quick times to reportedly the coolest Western States on record. Rather than temperatures around the century mark, runners encountered early rain and hail, with highs of just above 40 for the first 40 miles.Throughout the night, spectators watched for the light of runners' headlamps to enter the far corner of the track and continued cheering for the final runners through late-morning Sunday.For the second year in a row, and only the second time in the history of the race, more than 80 percent of the runners finished the endurance run by the 11 a.m. cutoff."\u000a

V"As Elk Grove prepares to swear in Gary Davis as its first directly elected mayor, the City Council is gearing up to appoint a replacement for Davis' vacated District 4 seat.The city is accepting applications from residents for the position on the five-member council. Completed applications are due to the city clerk by Wednesday, Jan. 2, at 5 p.m.After Davis is sworn in at the council meeting Wednesday, his seat will be up for grabs for the rest of his term, which ends Dec. 10, 2014.The League of Women Voters will host a forum with the candidates on Saturday, Jan. 5, at 6 p.m. at the council chambers, 8400 Laguna Palms Way. The candidates will have an opportunity to make a presentation to the City Council at its meeting on Jan. 9.The council may make an appointment at the Jan. 9 meeting, or could put it off to the Jan. 23 meeting.Davis represents a district in the southwestern part of the city, west of Highway 99 to Franklin Boulevard and south of Elk Grove Boulevard to Kammerer Road. Council members must reside in their respective districts in the city. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, a U.S. citizen and registered to vote.Since the city's incorporation in 2000, Elk Grove City Council members have selected one of their colleagues as mayor on a rotating basis, typically for a one-year term.Elk Grove voters approved a new election format in 2010. The package of election changes included voting for a mayor in a citywide at-large election for a two-year term, and reducing the number of council districts from five to four. Council member terms will remain four years.In July, the council remapped the districts, dissolving District 5, and merging it with Districts 2 and 4.District 5's current council representative, Sophia Scherman, made an unsuccessful bid for the state Assembly, then lost in the November Elk Grove mayoral election against Davis.The disappearance of her district and the loss in the mayor's race effectively bumped Scherman, marking the first time since incorporation the city will not have her serving on its council.Looking back at her dozen years as the only woman on the council, Scherman said Wednesday it's been ""an honor and a privilege to be at the very beginning of forming a new city.""She didn't rule out running for Elk Grove mayor again in two years, or making another run for Assembly. For now, however, Scherman will push for development of a veterans center in the city.During her tenure on the council, she described herself as being more focused on raising the quality of life for residents rather than rapid growth or ambitious expenditures.""I hope the council stays on that path somewhat,"" Scherman said. ""I'm worried they will spend too much money on ballfields or things like that.""So far, the only candidate filing papers for the vacant council position is LaWanna Montgomery, who also lost in the November mayoral race. She was accused of defacing Scherman's election signs, but the district attorney opted not to pursue charges because of the minimal damage and Montgomery's lack of a prior criminal history. Montgomery denied any involvement in vandalizing Scherman's signs.The directly elected mayor's post is largely a ceremonial title, with few special powers. The mayor will have the ability to appoint citizens to boards and commissions, with council approval.To apply for the council seat, go to the city's website at: www.elkgrovecity.org/council/ member-vacancies.aspFor more information, or to see the council district map: www.elkgrovecity.org/council"\u000a

V"An Elk Grove housing subdivision with a nine-year history of bitter opposition and legal snarls is back with a revised design and some of the same old worries.Silverado Village, a 660-home development, is proposed for 230 acres at the northwest corner of Bond and Waterman roads. The housing community is reincarnated from a past planned subdivision, Vintara Park, which sparked a lawsuit by nearby residents successfully challenging its traffic and water supply plans.Now, a new set of developers say they've spent a year huddling with nearby homeowners to craft a more palatable version of the subdivision, embarking on a full-blown environmental review to address traffic congestion and water deliveries, adding a senior housing component and improving drainage on the property.Residents in the surrounding Quail Ranch Estates and Fallbrook neighborhoods, however, still have many of the same concerns about too many new homes being built in open land on the outskirts of existing communities.As proposed, Silverado Village would have 660 single-family homes and an Eskaton village with up to 125 senior independent, assisted-living and memory care units.Developers also plan a 64.5-acre wetland habitat preserve, 6.5 acres of open space, a 16-acre drainage basin, 6 acres of parkland and public trails.The city is taking public comments on the project through Tuesday. After a traffic impact study and water supply report are submitted, a final environmental report will be released, followed by another 45-day public comment period. City staff expects the project to come before the Planning Commission by late July, before going to the City Council.Ed Johanson, president of developer Silverado Homes in Roseville, said residents' objections to the former Vintara Park project were triggered by high-density housing and the lack of a full environmental assessment  concerns that have now been addressed, he said.""Right at the outset, we met with local community groups and associations about density, we've had workshops for over a year, and have been getting support for this plan,"" Johanson said.He said the housing abutting Quail Ranch Estates is now more compatible to the existing neighborhood.Angee Wangsgard, who lives in Quail Ranch Estates and owns a home in Fallbrook, said she was pleased with the outreach efforts of the developer but is still worried about density, possible building of parks and sports fields on open spaces, and trampling of environmentally fragile habitats.She said the only substantial improvement in Silverado's concept is the addition of senior units, which she acknowledges will cut down on traffic congestion.""Residents are nervous,"" she said. ""This is a big deal for Elk Grove. There aren't very many big spaces like this left in Elk Grove.""In 1996, the county approved a tentative subdivision map for the property, called Elk Ridge Estates. The project never moved forward and the map expired.The land is currently owned by the Sacramento Area Sewer District and was declared surplus property in 2000.Centex Homes was negotiating to buy the land and proposed Vintara Park in 2004. In 2006, the city approved a pared-down environmental review process for the subdivision. Neighbors filed suit against the city.A judge ruled the city was lacking in its assessment of water and traffic impacts in 2008. Silverado Homes took over contract negotiations in a purchase agreement with the sewer district in 2009, submitting an application for a redesigned subdivision map last year."\u000a

V"WASHINGTON  A peer review of a controversial August federal report on the whereabouts of oil from BP's Deepwater Horizon well upholds its conclusion that three-quarters of the oil had been burned, skimmed or was in the process of degrading, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday.NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco acknowledged that she was wrong in August when she said the original report, which was viewed skeptically by many scientists, had been peer reviewed. The 217-page report released Tuesday was that review, and it validated the initial findings.Lubchenco said that ongoing studies are under way to reach a conclusion about the oil spill's environmental cost.I can't emphasize enough that it doesn't tell us where the oil is today or what its final fate will be or the impact, Lubchenco said.The initial report was released on Aug. 4, just slightly more than two weeks after BP successfully capped the well, which had gushed an estimated 4.1 million barrels of crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico over 87 days, the largest accidental oil spill ever.The report was intended to provide a budget of what had happened to that oil and to serve as a guide for efforts to clean up oil that could still be recovered.But it became the immediate target of some scientists who blasted as overly optimistic NOAA's conclusion that the vast majority of the oil . . . has either evaporated or been burned, skimmed, recovered from the wellhead or dispersed.The critics said the report implied that much of the oil was gone and no longer posed a risk and questioned how the government scientists had made their calculations. They said the work should have been reviewed by outside experts.Tuesday's document made few revisions in the original work. The latest results, by and large, are consistent with early results, the report said.The lead authors of the report were Bill Lehr of NOAA, Sky Bristol of the U.S. Geological Survey and Antonio Possolo of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Fifteen other scientists and experts took part in the review, representing universities, consulting groups, ExxonMobil and Canada's environment and fisheries agencies. The University of New Hampshire's Coastal Response Research Center coordinated the review.The authors' most important change was in the estimate of how much oil had been chemically dispersed. That estimate was revised to 16 percent from 8 percent, though the authors said it could have been anywhere from 10 percent to 29 percent.Lubchenco said the revision was made on the basis of a better understanding of how dispersants worked below the surface.The BP blowout was the first time large amounts of chemical dispersants were applied in deep water.NOAA is coordinating ongoing studies to determine where the oil is now amid reports that some still floats in the Gulf and some has settled into the Gulf's seabed.Scientific vessels have made 125 sampling expeditions to collect 31,000 water and sediment samples in a broad area of the northern Gulf, but those results haven't been released yet.The result of that research is more important than where the oil was in August, said Charles Hopkinson, a marine sciences professor at the University of Georgia and the director of the Georgia Sea Grant College Program. Hopkinson was part of a team that did an oil budget that reached different conclusions in August.We want to know where it is now, he said.

V"Two popular annual events  the Kokanee Salmon Festival and Oktoberfest  will take place near the west end of South Lake Tahoe next weekend.Since the parking areas fill quickly, visitors are urged to bike, walk or take public transportation, said Lisa Herron of the U.S. Forest Service's Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit.BlueGo buses and the Nifty Fifty trolley will provide special service to the events, Herron said. Bus and trolley information is available at (530) 541-7149. A pedestrian and bike path are in the area, as well as other walking trails. The salmon festival, at the Forest Service's Taylor Creek Visitor Center, celebrates the annual fall migration of kokanee salmon as they travel up Taylor Creek from Lake Tahoe to mate, spawn and die in the streams where they hatched.The visitor center, three miles north of South Lake Tahoe on Highway 89, plans children's activities, trail runs, educational streamside programs, other wildlife programs and a salmon barbecue.A stream profile chamber at the center provides an up-close view of the salmon. Fall colors along the nearby trails afford easy, scenic hikes, but visitors should heed the ""bear aware"" signs, as black bears also enjoy the salmon.A complete list of salmon festival events and their times is available by visiting www.fs.usda.gov/goto/ltbmu/ KokaneeSalmonFestival.Oktoberfest events at the nearby historic Camp Richardson Resort include German food, live music, a pumpkin patch, craft booths, a beer and wine garden, ""bouncy castle,"" face painting and costume contest for dogs and their owners."\u000a

V"Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" was purchased in the 1880s for $1. Today it is the centerpiece of a show of 17th century Dutch paintings at San Francisco's de Young Museum, where it has a room of its own. Vermeer's most famous painting is the showstopper of the display of 35 paintings from the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis, the Hague, Netherlands.While it's Vermeer's best-known painting, thanks to the novel and the movie of the same name, it is not my favorite Vermeer. Yes, the lady in question is appealing in her ultramarine blue turban and the large pearl symbolizing purity, made by three bold brush strokes. She looks up in anticipation, mouth slightly open, as if someone or something has awakened her from a reverie.But for me, it doesn't compare with the National Gallery's ""Girl With the Red Hat"" or ""A Lady Writing."" Still it is a marvel, and you will no doubt have trouble getting close to it in the crowds that are bound to attend this show.Those who go will be more than gratified by the exhibit as a whole. There are four paintings by Rembrandt, including a small but glowing image of the nude Susanna and a boldly painted portrait of an elderly man. The youth and innocence of Susanna, a biblical figure who according to myth was surprised at her bath by a group of leering old men, are palpable. Here she is alone, glorious in her golden pubescence.The other painting is an honest, straightforward view of a salt-of-the-earth type man well into his old age and wholly comfortable with himself. Both are as prepossessing as Vermeer's painting of the girl.So is Carel Fabritius' small still life of a goldfinch, which reminds me of a Wayne Thiebaud in its simplicity and dashing application of paint. A student of Rembrandt, Fabritius renders the tiny bird in swift brush strokes, its drab body lit up by a flash of gold on its wing. It and the Rembrandts would be reason alone to visit this show.But the show offers a fine survey of the Dutch Golden Age, when secular subjects began to replace religious ones in a country with a prosperous middle class that yearned for images that reflected its values, which echo our own American ideals of middle-class comforts and quiet domesticity.In addition to portraiture, paintings from the period present landscapes of the flat lowlands and waterways, including Salomon van Ruisdael's jaunty ""View of a Lake With Sailing Ships."" His nephew Jacob van Ruisdael's fascinating picture of a bleaching field, where linens were whitened in the sun, reflects Holland's importance as a textile center.The landscapes give way to a selection of still-life paintings that take your breath away. In addition to ""The Goldfinch,"" there is a sumptuous still life of a wilting bouquet by Rachel Ruysch, one of the few female painters of the period. Even lovelier is Abraham van Beyeren's painting of flowers in full bloom with a timepiece, the canvas rich with delicate tones of red and pink. There is also an classic vanitas still life with a skull and a timepiece by Pieter Claesz, which symbolizes the brevity of life and its pleasures.A wonderful selection of genre paintings that reflect the life and times of the people of the period are also on view, including Jan Steen's largest painting, a scene of a family gathering after a baptism, where the people relax with wine and pipes, and his smallest painting, ""The Oyster Eater,"" which depicts a wonderfully lascivious woman eating the aphrodisiac denizens of the sea.As if the Mauritshuis exhibit wasn't enough, it is accompanied by ""Rembrandt's Century, a show of masterful prints from the 17th century including approximately 50 magnificent Rembrandt etchings, among them ""Faust's Study,"" ""The Raising of Lazarus"" and ""The Three Crosses.""Both shows take a good deal of time to see, so you may want to spend the day at the museum where you can also get spectacular views of San Francisco in the de Young's tower and have lunch in the cafe.These are timed and ticketed exhibitions so you will want to get your tickets early on the de Young's website.GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRINGWhat: Dutch paintings from the MauritshuisWhere: M.H. de Young Museum, Golden Gate Park, 50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive, San FranciscoWhen: 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday; 9:30 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. Friday (from late March to late November).

V"Del Campo's Megan Roberson and Del Oro's Stephanie Geyer have much in common.They're tall, punishing post players who, despite their considerable size advantage, often take their share of physical abuse because of it.The seniors are the leaders of their teams, both of which have made the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II playoff field after roller-coaster seasons.The former AAU teammates also aren't blessed with bountiful physical gifts, other than their height. But through many hours of dedication and hard work, they have carved themselves into scholarship athletes.Their college basketball careers will also be similar, yet decidedly different than most of their area scholarship peers.Instead of having their lives mapped out for them the next four or five years, they're making a commitment that could last a decade or longer.The 6-foot-4 Roberson will play at the Air Force Academy while the 6-1 Geyer heads for West Point.Another coincidence? Neither knew anything about the Air Force or Army when they started to consider potential colleges.""The Army wasn't even on my radar,"" Geyer said. ""When (Army associate) coach Colleen Mullen first contacted me, I was excited and scared. I kept asking questions. I must have kept her on the phone for 45 minutes. But I was intrigued.""Geyer was sold once she toured the historic campus in West Point, N.Y., and took in the Army vs. Boston College football game last October.""It's so beautiful that you know you're in a different world,"" Geyer said.Roberson saw the Air Force Academy, in Colorado Springs, Colo., as a unique opportunity, even with the five-year military commitment that comes after college graduation.""I knew I wanted to do something different,"" she said. ""The campus is amazing, and I felt comfortable right away. The people are just awesome. If I'm going to be away from home that long, I want people around who are going to make it feel like family.""Both also saw the career opportunities. Geyer aspires to be a doctor, and Roberson has an interest in criminal justice.""You graduate from college with a job,"" said Roberson, who will attend the Air Force Prep Academy in Colorado Springs for a year. ""I couldn't pass that up considering the way the job situation is today for a lot of graduates.""Their high school coaches see a good fit for their leaders.""Megan's best attributes are her competitiveness, determination and discipline,"" said Del Campo's Tyson Garcia. ""She's got great leadership skills, and her best basketball is yet to come. I think Air Force will help her to continue to grow, and when all is said and done, she'll be an impact player at the next level.""Said Del Oro's Mike Takayama: ""The military isn't right for everyone, but for Stephanie it seems like the right place. She's very organized, structured and intelligent. She always gives her best effort, whether its basketball or in the classroom.""Right now, both are shouldering the loads as their teams head into the playoffs. On Tuesday, No. 5 Del Oro plays host to No. 12 Tracy while No. 10 Del Campo travels to No. 7 Rocklin.Already an accomplished defender and rebounder, Geyer also became the Golden Eagles' go-to scorer this season, averaging a career-high 15.8 points to go with 8.3 rebounds picking up for the loss of star guard Brianna Ruiz to a summer knee injury. Ruiz, who returned to play last week, and Geyer were co-Sierra Foothill League MVPs last season.""Stephanie's evolved from being more of a defender who picked up garbage baskets to someone capable of hitting the mid-range jumper,"" Takayama said.While Roberson's strengths are her shot blocking - her total of 207 blocks leads the state - and rebounding (14 per game), she's also averaging a career-best 12.2 points for the Cougars.Roberson has worked hard on her shooting skills but admits to still being an offensive work in progress.""My biggest asset always has been blocking someone's shot, so I resort to my strength,"" she said. ""Blocking a shot for me is like making a three-pointer.""Geyer's nose was broken last season against Oak Ridge, and she was forced to wear a protective mask.""Playing in the post is like wrestling two or three people while trying to put a ball in the basket,"" Geyer said. ""I come home after games all scratched up.""Roberson said it's rare that she ever gets an uncontested shot near the basket.""I'm usually getting double- or triple-teamed, so I've always got someone bumping or pushing me,"" Roberson said. ""You just have to play through it.""As their high school careers wind down, both say they are amazed at how far they have come after initial struggles and reservations.""There was a time in elementary school when I refused to play basketball because I was so tall and everyone expected me to,"" said Roberson, who played water polo in the fall and will swim in the spring for Del Campo. ""Now, it's my passion.""Geyer, who played volleyball for the Golden Eagles, likes to poke fun at her formative years in basketball.""I'm sure there's blackmail tape out there of me in seventh grade,"" Geyer said, laughing. ""I spent more time on the ground than standing. I can still hear it now, 'Did Stephanie fall over, again?' """\u000a

V"As the marketing guy and football coach at Capital Christian High School, Phil Grams figures if there can be a Holy Bowl, why not a Fish Bowl?The annual Jesuit-Christian Brothers football game  the Holy Bowl, played Sept. 15 this season  is a landmark event each year at Hughes Stadium. The game often draws crowds exceeding 15,000 as alumni and supporters flock to the historic stadium at Sacramento City College to root for their respective parochial school teams, regardless of records.Grams, Capital Christian's second-year coach, hopes to create similar buzz by hosting nearby private-school rival Bradshaw Christian tonight at 7:30 in the inaugural Fish Bowl, named for the sponsoring Christian contemporary music radio station.Capital Christian is a school of 377 students located off Highway 50 near Bradshaw Road in Rosemont. Bradshaw Christian, a school of 304 students, is nine miles south on the same road.""It just makes sense,"" Grams said. ""There's definitely a rivalry between the two schools because we aren't that far apart. We battle for the same kids.""Both schools have had athletic success in numerous sports, but Bradshaw Christian, despite fielding a team only since 2006, has become dominant on a small scale in football.Coach Drew Rickert's Pride has won three Sac-Joaquin Section championships and was the runner-up once in the past four years, including last season's 11-1 campaign that resulted in a D-VI banner.Capital Christian won the D-V section football title in 2009 and was the D-VI runner-up in 2007 under then-coach Karl Zierhut but went only 9-11 over 2010 and 2011.Still, the Cougars are optimistic. Grams, formerly the offensive coordinator at Granite Bay, has brought coach Ernie Cooper's famed fly offense and intellectual brand of smash-mouth football to Capital Christian.Golden Sierra manhandled visiting Capital Christian 27-7 last season, but the host Cougars turned the tables at home on the Grizzlies, winning 47-3 last week.While small in numbers with 23 players, Capital Christian has big-school size in quarterback-defensive back Matthew Bailey (6-foot-3, 185 pounds) and linemen Nifae Lealao (6-4, 262), Matt Richards (6-2, 245) and Brandon Roznos (5-11, 251).Lealao, last season's Golden Empire League Defensive Lineman of the Year as a sophomore, is a recruiting target of major colleges, including Stanford.Behind their line, the Cougars rushed for 436 yards against Golden Sierra, with Quinton Kirk (166 yards, one touchdown) and Ethan Russo (101 yards, two touchdowns) leading the way.Bradshaw Christian graduated its top three running backs from last season's team, which averaged 427 rushing yards employing the wing-T, but the Pride always seems to reload.Bradshaw Christian rushed for 438 yards in a 42-13 Zero Week win over Maxwell, with junior Jordy Hawkins leading the way with 182 yards and three touchdowns.Providing leadership for Bradshaw Christian are quarterback-defensive back Kevin Williams, wide receiver-defensive back Kyle Betts, linebacker Logan Newton and linemen Zach Rangel and Jake Fiksdal.Both schools have made it no secret that they hope to increase enrollment and play at higher levels (Capital Christian is in D-IV and Bradshaw Christian D-VI). But it's tough sledding in the one area of California where the top public school programs overshadow the private ones.""It was culture shock coming from Granite Bay, where we'd have 75 kids,"" Grams said. ""Sacramento has great public school football. But we have a lot to offer, too, spiritually, athletically and academically. We have room for 700 to 800 kids, so we want to grow our school.""Bradshaw Christian's only loss last year was to D-IV power Colfax 54-14 in the Smackdown at Sactown showcase at Grant. The Pride will play D-III Vista del Lago (1,428 students) on Sept. 14.""We want to play bigger schools; we need to play bigger schools and keep moving up and keep pushing the kids,"" Rickert said."\u000a

V"Hundreds of middle school students sent their Lego robots into battle Saturday at Sacramento's Inderkum High School in a competition to see which creation could complete the most tasks.Students came from 48 schools in 15 Northern California counties. The teams spent months building their robots from scratch and programming them.At the end of the day, the Folsom DYNObytes claimed first place. The team of eight students came from a variety of schools and grade levels in the Folsom area. The Eggheads, a team from Petaluma, placed second.The Folsom team advances to the state competition, to be held in May at Legoland in Carlsbad, north of San Diego.Parents and students shared in the excitement of the competition.""It's science. You want to inspire kids,"" said parent Vani Kakarla, who was cheering on her daughter Vinootna, 13.Vinootna's seven-member robotics team from Fallon Middle School in Dublin was called Challenge Accepted.""It's a race car design, has four wheels and we use it to do missions,"" Vinootna said, describing the team's robot.The competition is sponsored by FIRST Lego League, a nonprofit that uses educational programs to engage middle and high school students in science and math.The league is a partnership between the organization For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology and the Lego Group, maker of Lego products.""We're having a blast,"" competition organizer Heidi Buck said during Saturday's event. ""How fun it is to be a nerd.""Many of event volunteers were former FIRST Lego League competitors, Buck said. The league's inaugural competition was in 1999.Each robot is judged on design, teamwork and its ability to complete assigned tasks. Once the robot leaves the start line, no one is allowed to touch it. The robot is expected to move on its own, based on computer programming.Eric Smith of Meadow Vista explained how competitors are expected to program the Lego robot to do certain tasks.""You can program the number of wheel rotations or make it follow a line,"" said the 13-year-old Weimar Hills School student.One task, he said, involves pushing a Lego flag up and traveling on a ramp. The robots have 2 minutes, 30 seconds to complete all the assigned tasks, and are judged on the quality and the number completed.Buck said some of the teams have applied for their own patents."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/09/5177116/sac-high-answers-coachs-call-clinches.html,"Sacramento High's Michele Massari is a tough-love coach.While Lynette Johnson and No. 3 Kennedy matched the top-ranked Dragons basket for basket in a Metro Conference senior night showdown in Oak Park, Massari was getting in the ears of senior Allie Green, junior Chaya Durr and freshman Aliceah Hernandez.Green and Durr, the team's two stars, weren't providing the defensive spark Massari expected, especially with the Utah State-bound Johnson going for 17 points in the first half. Hernandez, suffering from the flu, was playing lethargically.""I'm never satisfied,"" Massari said. ""The kids think I'm crazy.""But Green, Durr, Hernandez and the rest of the Dragons took Massari's intense critiques to heart.The teams went down to the wire in their first meeting with the Dragons winning by four. On Friday night, Sacramento turned a 23-23 tie with just under two minutes to play in the first half into a rout.With Green, Durr and Hernandez leading the way, the Dragons went on a 15-0 run and held Kennedy to 15 points in the second half en route to a 54-38 victory.The win assured the Dragons (22-4, 13-0) of another Metro Conference championship and extended their league winning streak to 90.Green scored 18 points, Hernandez scored 15 on 5-of-7 shooting, and Durr had 12. Johnson, limited to four points in the second half, finished with 21 for Kennedy (20-5, 11-2).Kennedy's steadfastness through two quarters couldn't match Sacramento's intensity and depth in the final 16 minutes. The exhausted Cougars made just 5 of 24 shots in the second half and were 1 of 10 from the foul line for the game.Massari credited dedicated team conditioning coach Alex Van Dyke, a former NFL player, for helping the Dragons continue to build endurance through a long, exhausting season.""He was at senior night with his daughter at Cosumnes Oaks (High School), then drove back here to warm our girls up,"" Massari said. ""He plays a huge part every day in what we are able to do.""Before the start of the varsity game, a moment of silence was held for Cal State Fullerton assistant coach Monica Quan and her fiance. The two were killed Sunday, allegedly by a former Los Angeles police officer, the subject of a Southern California manhunt.Quan recruited Sac High's Casey Williams, who signed a letter of intent with the Titans in November. Williams has missed this season because of a shoulder injury but as a senior night reward, Massari started her, then quickly removed her after the tipoff.Kennedy and Sacramento, both defending Sac-Joaquin Section champions in Divisions I and III, will complete the regular season Monday. Sacramento plays at No. 4 McClatchy, and Kennedy is at Burbank."\u000a

V"The pleasures of prime ski season in the Sierra have arrived with a dark side  the peril of avalanches.Tahoe area officials are warning skiers and back-country recreationists of ""considerable"" avalanche danger this week after three incidents caused several injuries and killed two people  including a ski patrol member doing avalanche control work.Sierra Avalanche Center officials say heavy snowfall in recent days, along with fluctuating temperatures and wind, have left the Sierra snowpack unstable.""All these things create the perfect storm for avalanche conditions,"" said Jenny Hatch, center director.This week's two deaths matched last year's avalanche fatality total for the Tahoe area. There have been 19 avalanche fatalities in California in the last decade.Cal-OSHA on Wednesday launched an investigation into the death of Bill Foster, 53, a ski patrol veteran at Alpine Meadows Resort, who was buried Monday in an avalanche he and other patrol members had triggered as part of the resort's avalanche-safety program.Cal-OSHA spokesman Greg Siggins said investigators will review Alpine Meadows' procedures, safety protocols, training and equipment. ""They'll look at details of the (avalanche prevention) plan, talk to colleagues  make sure employees have been trained properly.""Foster was part of a five-person team that was throwing explosives into a closed section of Sherwood Bowl, Alpine Meadows President Andy Wirth said. He was stationed at a spot that was believed to be safe, but an explosive tossed by a team member caused an avalanche to initiate higher and wider on the slope than expected, carrying Foster with it. Fellow ski patrollers found him within a minute and uncovered him within eight minutes, Wirth said.Foster was pronounced dead at Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, where he had been airlifted.Also on Monday, snowboarder Steven Mark Anderson, 49, of Truckee, was killed when buried by an avalanche at Donner Ski Ranch.The day before, snowboarders at Squaw Valley Ski Resort touched off an avalanche, causing minor injuries to two skiers. Neither skier, a 39-year-old woman who was treated at the resort's clinic and a 16-year-old boy who went to a Truckee hospital with a shoulder injury, was buried in snow.Avalanches often occur when a heavy layer of newer snow fails to adhere well with the existing layer of snow from a previous storm. The danger is heightened this week, U.S. Forest Service officials said, because the previous snowfall was mixed with rain, creating a frozen surface.Officials said humans can trigger a slippage between two snow slabs with only a small amount of downward pressure at the wrong spot on the snow surface.""We have some weak layers right on the edge of failure just sitting there,"" said Forest Service avalanche forecaster Andy Anderson. ""It doesn't take much extra force. Once you break one spot it is like dominoes across the rest of the slope.""Joanne Roubique, district ranger for the Truckee District of the Forest Service, issued a special warning Wednesday to snowmobilers and others who venture into remote areas outside ski area boundaries, where avalanche possibilities are higher and where rescue is more difficult. ""For backcountry skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling, we encourage everybody to get the best education they can (first),"" Roubique said.Snow safety classes are offered by colleges, ski associations, sports shops and guide companies.Roubique said recreationists also should check the avalanche center's website  www.sierraavalanchecenter.-org  for daily updates on avalanche conditions before venturing beyond groomed and populated areas.The nonprofit avalanche center, in conjunction with the Forest Service, employs researchers who check snow conditions daily and post their findings on the center website and on Facebook, and broadcast them on Twitter.Forest Service officials say anyone traveling outside of groomed ski areas should carry safety devices, including a tracking beacon, whistles, shovels and poles that act as snow probes in case someone gets buried.""Everybody in your party should have a beacon and know how to use it,"" Roubique said.Ski areas  where slope grooming and avalanche control occur  are generally much safer than the back country, experts say, thanks in large part to the avalanche control work done by ski patrols. But they are not immune to problems.Wirth, president and CEO of the Alpine and Squaw Valley ski areas, said skiers and snowboarders should ski in pairs for safety.""Snow conditions are variable right now, and we need people to use real caution,"" Wirth said. ""Ski and ride with a partner.""Alpine Meadows posted an homage to Foster on its Facebook site Wednesday. Wirth described Foster as a man with a passion for the mountains and said he was a member of a professional team that does a dangerous job.""Our ski patrols are among the best in North America,"" Wirth said. ""They are experts with a great deal of training.""Mark Fisher, a longtime Alpine skier and publisher of the blog, www.unofficial alpine.com, said Foster's death cast a pall among workers at the resort on Christmas day, even as skiers enjoyed deep snow.""On the surface, it was just another sweet powder day at Alpine Meadows,"" Fisher wrote. ""But underneath the surface, employees were reeling from the death of patroller Bill Foster. ... It was easy to notice the Alpine employees and other friends of Bill, in hushed conversations, often with tear-filled eyes.""Editor's Note: This article has been changed from the print version to correct the spelling of Andy Wirth's last name. Corrected on Dec. 27, 2012."\u000a

V"Somewhere, there's a college football program that needs a kicker or punter.Andrew Endicott knows it's true because the Jesuit High School senior studies the college game, picks through rosters and depth charts and sees special-team players come and go.But Endicott has found the competition to land a scholarship frustrating and humbling.Endicott has what coaches call a ""live leg,"" and he's ready to launch 45-yard field goals or punts just as long on Saturdays in the fall. All he needs is a taker.""I love kicking, but recruiting for a kicker is not a fun process,"" Endicott said this week after a North practice for the 56th Optimist All-Star Football Classic. ""We're different than other recruits. We really are the bottom of the pool. It's easier to find kickers and punters than other positions, and sometimes they start (for) four years.""Endicott, The Bee's All-Metro kicker, expects to be a factor in today's game at Del Oro High School while facing an oncoming defensive rush. If he is, it won't be the first time a kicker has impressed in this annual football showcase.The 1974 Optimist game launched Jim Breech of Sacramento High from scholarship hopeful to all-time kicking great. Breech was an 11th-hour replacement for El Camino's Butch Edge after the flamethrowing pitcher signed a contract as a first-round pick of the Milwaukee Brewers. Cal coaches liked what they saw in Breech in the Optimist game and offered him a scholarship. Breech, now in executive insurance sales in Ohio, has said the Optimist experience shaped his life. He went on to have a prolific NFL career, including 12 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, and he's the team's all-time scoring leader.Jared Siegel of Jesuit was another Sacramento-area kicker who landed a scholarship, with Oregon in 2001. He was a four-year starter for the Ducks, setting school scoring marks.Could Endicott be the next area kicker to land a scholarship?""I love kicking, and I can't see myself not kicking in college,"" said Endicott, who wants to study psychology.Endicott also points out that he doesn't just have one strong leg  he has two. He beams while talking about his scrambling ability when an extra-point kick goes bad and about his club soccer days.This semester, Endicott used those legs to hustle to his car after the third-period bell at Jesuit. He volunteered four days a week at the Laurel Ruff Center in Carmichael, tutoring a 16-year-old girl with a severe autism disorder. And he said he will resume his Jesuit peer mentor role next semester, meeting with underclassmen to help with academic and social progress.Endicott said he could come full circle; he may wind up as a teacher and coach at Jesuit.Any advice for scholarship hopefuls?Said Endicott: ""You have to be patient and understanding."""\u000a

V"Lawmakers need to overhaul the tax code completely to reduce the ""significant, even unconscionable, burden"" placed on taxpayers just to file a tax return, the Internal Revenue Service's ombudsman told Congress on Wednesday. In her legally required annual report to Congress, national taxpayer advocate Nina Olson estimated that individuals and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax-filing requirements. That adds up to the equivalent of more than 3 million full-time workers, or more than the number of jobs on the entire federal government's payroll. And filing is only becoming more complicated as lawmakers haggle over new tax breaks. Since 2001, Congress has made nearly 5,000 changes to the U.S. tax code, or more than one a day on average. Nine in 10 taxpayers now pay money for professional preparers or often-expensive commercial tax software to figure out how much money they owe the government. One of the advocate's suggestions for streamlining the tax code was to repeal the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax system intended to make sure rich Americans pay more in taxes. The AMT is increasingly engulfing middle-class taxpayers. Another proposal was to reduce the number of income exclusions, deductions and credits, known collectively as ""tax expenditures,"" that clutter up the tax code and are estimated at about $1.1 trillion, whereas individual income tax revenue will be about $1.4 trillion."\u000a

V"Nine months out of prison, Phillip Hernandez wrote an impassioned plea to Sacramento's family court to let him try fatherhood.He described being a ""fully and utterly changed"" man with a desire to ""correct past wrongs."" He talked about going to work and saving money and buying a home for himself and his boys, whom he hadn't seen in three years.""Because ultimately, they are what matter, my view of life and what is important in it is family,"" he wrote to the court in July 2008, asking for visitation rights. ""Please hear my plea and help me be there.  I want to give them what I didn't have  a father.""The words hardly sound like those of the man portrayed in earlier criminal court records as abusive of his wife, disobedient of the law and defiant of the court. And most starkly, they stand in contrast to the depiction of Hernandez by Sacramento police as a child killer.Police allege that Hernandez used a hatchet to brutally attack his youngest son, 9-year-old Matthew Raymond Hernandez, as he slept on the couch of their South Natomas home Tuesday night. The violence was witnessed by the boy's great-grandmother, who made two hysterical 911 calls.Officers arrived to find the fourth-grader dead and his 12-year-old brother, who was home at the time of the slaying, unharmed. Hernandez, 36, was arrested about a mile away.He is scheduled to be arraigned today on one charge of murder.Detectives, relatives and community members have sought answers in the aftermath of the attack, to no avail. Hernandez is being held in the Sacramento County Main Jail's psychiatric ward, but no one has alleged that he is mentally ill.Criminal and family court records dating back to 2004 offer a troubling portrait of Hernandez. Three months after separating from his wife and the mother of his two children, Jessica Hernandez, he pleaded no contest to inflicting felony corporal injury upon her.He was sentenced to 120 days in jail and five years of formal probation. According to Sacramento Superior Court records, the requirements of his probation included alcohol and drug rehabilitation; completion of a 52-week batterers' treatment program; and no contact with the victim.In April 2005, the court revoked his probation at the urging of the Probation Department, records show. He consistently failed to attend his batterers' treatment program; he did not enroll in a rehab program and he did not make scheduled restitution payments, according to the records.Hernandez was sent to the Sheriff's Work Project as a result, but he failed to show up to that, too, and a no-bail warrant was issued for his arrest. He then served 90 days of jail time, records show.He violated the terms of his probation again in November 2005 when he was arrested in West Sacramento on suspicion of domestic violence, according to the court records. Shortly thereafter, the court again revoked his probation; he still had not completed a batterers' treatment program or drug rehab and he violated a court-imposed restraining order by contacting his ex-wife.In that incident, he argued with Jessica Hernandez, forced his way into her doorway, bruised her arm and smashed her cellphone as she tried to call police, according to the West Sacramento police report filed in court.Hernandez was sent to prison in July 2006, serving concurrent terms for the probation violation in Sacramento County and the domestic violence conviction in Yolo County. He was released in October 2007.Public records and those provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation do not indicate any parole violations or other criminal charges since then. He was discharged from parole in November 2008.It was July 31 of that year when he pleaded with the court to allow him access to his two boys. A family court judge issued a temporary order allowing him one visit a month, to which Jessica Hernandez immediately objected.""He is a dangerous man and I am terrified to leave my sons in his care,"" she wrote.They were sent to mediation and in January 2009 signed an agreement that gave custody to the boys' mother and some visitation rights to their father, according to records contained in the couple's divorce file.That summer, Jessica Hernandez allowed the children to stay with their father ""to try and make up for the time he had missed in their lives"" and because ""he was in a better financial position than me,"" she wrote in a later court document.Meanwhile, Phillip Hernandez wrote to the court, charging that the boys' mother was ""unstable"" and not caring properly for them.It was not immediately clear from the court file whether the boys ever returned to the physical custody of their mother. Last October, she wrote to the court saying her financial status and ""quality of life"" had improved and she wanted the boys to move out of state to join her.""This is nothing personal toward their father,"" she wrote. ""I am certain I could provide for them better for the time being.""But a judge ordered custody to Phillip Hernandez, with visitation for Jessica. The parties were scheduled to return to court in July for an update.Meanwhile, their 12-year-old son is staying with family since his father's arrest."\u000a

V"Tuesday was Senior Night at Sheldon High School.A baseline wall poster painted by students pretty much sized this group up as a whole: Studs.Studs and scholars, actually.The Huskies, ranked No. 1 by The Bee all season and state-ranked fifth by Cal-Hi Sports, is a collection of versatile basketball players who also lead by example academically, including honors classes in producing the sort of grades that make for scholarship locks.With their senior lineup scoring, rebounding and sharing the ball, the Huskies held off No. 2 Pleasant Grove 84-77 in another Delta River League thriller, to lock up the championship outright.Dakarai Allen, headed to San Diego State, had 27 points, 12 rebounds, four steals and three blocked shots.Washington-bound guard-forward Darin Johnson scored 21 of his 23 points in the second half. Ryan Manning went for 13 points with inside plays and three-pointers, San Diego State-bound floor leader D'Erryl Williams had eight points, eight rebounds and six assists. Unsung grunts Antonio Lewis and Jalen Hicks combined for 10 points and 10 rebounds.Sheldon made nine three-pointers and was 23 of 31 from the line. The Huskies (21-5, 10-0) scored their final 11 points from the line on 14 attempts.Pleasant Grove (21-5, 8-2) again showed it could go toe-to-toe with Sheldon, the three-time defending Sac-Joaquin Section Division I champion. In the first meeting Jan. 25, the visiting Huskies prevailed 85-79. In the rematch, Cole Nordquist scored 31 points with 12 rebounds, and fellow three-year senior starters Malik Thames and Matt Hayes went for 21 and 12, respectively.Section seedings and brackets will be released today. Sheldon expects the No. 1 seed with Pleasant Grove the likely No. 3 seed, meaning on the opposite bracket with a chance for a third bout in the section finals at Sleep Train Arena next month.""Yes, definitely I think we'll see them again,"" Allen said. ""There's a reason we're ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the area. But we know we've got to take care of business first and win the early rounds.""Sheldon unleashed its full school arsenal. It started with a packed gym by halftime of the junior varsity game.""It's a lot of fun playing PG,"" Williams said. ""The fans got here early and (it) was great.""Lewis scored a putback at the halftime buzzer for a 37-35 Sheldon lead, and Thames dropped in a buzzer-beating three to pull Pleasant Grove to within 59-57 after three quarters.In the fourth, there were 11 ties or lead changes. Manning's three gave Sheldon a 67-66 lead and a Johnson tip with 3:47 left put the Huskies up 71-69, a lead they would not lose. Pleasant Grove collectively was disappointed but hardly discouraged. A new season looms.""I like our chances,"" Eagles coach John DePonte said. ""We can't make mistakes, though. We don't have the horses that they do and afford mistakes.""On Nordquist, DePonte said, ""We can never fault his effort. He gives us his heart and soul."""\u000a

V"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico  There may have been a time when Puerto Rico was a cheap getaway but those days are long gone. Puerto Rico is heavily dependent on imported goods and fuel and that's reflected in prices from a taxi ride from the airport to the mojito at your hotel. And it is, after all, the Caribbean, where tourists should expect eye-popping bills in season. A six-star hotel that opened recently in Dorado, east of San Juan, advertised rates starting at $1,500 a night, ranging up to nearly $5,000. There are, of course, cheaper options. There are also things to do that don't cost anything at all. Here are five of them.BeachesIt's an island about the size of Connecticut so there are many beaches, about 300 according to some estimates. In the capital, Isla Verde Beach is good for swimming and lolling on soft sand, groomed daily. Playita del Condado is a protected cove that is ideal for young kids and a surprisingly good place to snorkel for being in the middle of San Juan.Things get much better outside the capital. Crash Boat, about an hour west of San Juan, is great for swimming and snorkeling. Farther west in the west coast town of Rincon is Maria's, which has great surf. Also recommended are the beaches along the entrance to the Gunica Dry Forest Reserve as well as Seven Seas in the east coast town of Fajardo. A good tip for all Puerto Rican beaches is to go early in the morning when the water is calm and there are no crowds. Otherwise, go to Vieques, which has spectacular beaches that are secluded even in high season.El YunqueAbout a half-hour drive from San Juan, thanks to a relatively new toll road, is an actual tropical rain forest, the only one that is part of the U.S. forest system. El Yunque National Forest is a cool oasis on a hot day. The well-maintained trails are often shrouded in misty clouds and you can cool off in a waterfall or a river pool along the relatively easy Big Tree Trail.El MorroThere's an entrance fee to enter the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, but the best way to enjoy this U.S. National Historic Site requires no money at all. The fort that towers over San Juan Bay, known universally as just ""El Morro,"" is a great place to stroll, especially at sunset. The massive rolling expanse of grass at the foot of the fort has spectacular views in any direction. It's a popular place to picnic and fly a kite, sold by street vendors.Old San JuanAt the foot of El Morro is the old city, the colonial heart of San Juan. In recent years, Old San Juan has been on an upswing; its cobblestone streets are cleaner and livelier. New stores, restaurants and coffee shops have opened and many of the old homes have been restored. It's a working city, home to the governor's office and mansion  said to be the oldest in the Western Hemisphere  as well as other government offices and an increasing number of professional firms. It's also become an increasingly busy cruise ship port and outlet and luxury goods shops have proliferated in response.Music and salsaA good place to catch free live music several nights a week is the Plaza Mercado, a fruit and vegetable market in Santurce, a neighborhood that is also home to what are considered some of the best restaurants in Puerto Rico. The lobby of the El San Juan in Isla Verde usually has live music and dancing on weekends. The bar of course isn't free but there's no charge to get in. The dancers can be intimidatingly good so the less-skilled may be content just to watch the scene."\u000a

Taylor Laird passed to Namani Parker for a touchdown as time expired to cut Lincoln's lead to 43-42.A point-after kick could have tied the score and forced overtime. But losing three defensive starters to injuries ""made us vulnerable down the stretch,"" said Oakmont coach Tim Moore, who wasn't sure his fatigued bunch could hold off Lincoln in overtime.Lining up to kick the extra point, the Vikings instead ran a fake for the ages. Laird, the holder, took the snap and stood with his back to the oncoming rush. He flipped the ball over his head to Justin Holmes in the end zone for the two-point conversion. Holmes outleaped Lincoln defenders for the catch and the victory. The play triggered a wild celebration that continued when students returned to the Roseville campus on Monday. (Search ""Oakmont conversion"" on YouTube to watch the play.)Moore was still breathing heavily Sunday.""We practiced that play multiple times a week since August, and it worked every time,"" Moore said. ""We didn't want to go into overtime. Crazy finish.""More special teams  A week after Jorge Vega's first field-goal attempt of the season, a 32-yarder, gave struggling Grant a last-second 31-30 win over Del Oro, another unsung player came through in his first attempt.On Friday, Danny Perez, a backup kicker for No. 16 Rio Linda, unexpectedly was thrust into a pressure-packed situation and responded with a 35-yard field goal to defeat upstart Ponderosa.Perez replaced Jonathan Tafoya, one of the area's best. Tafoya was slowed by a leg strain from soccer, and in went an unsuspecting Perez after a late drive. Perez, for all his desire and leg drive, is the first to admit he's not the most accurate kicker.""Somewhere in the middle of that drive, (assistant coach) Jack Garceau comes to me and asks if I am thinking field goal at all,"" Rio Linda coach Mike Morris said. ""With a sick look on my face, I say, 'Yeah.' ""Perez watched after connecting with the ball, thinking his kick was short. But the ball cleared the crossbar, and Perez was mobbed by teammates and coaches as the Knights handed the Bruins their first loss of the season.""The referees told me it cleared by less than a foot,"" Morris said. ""Jack handed Perez the (kicking) tee just before he sent him out there. That was probably the right thing to do.""Victory at last  Del Oro beat NorCal No. 3 Logan of Union City 20-13 in overtime on Friday in Loomis for its first victory of the season.After falling to Oaks Christian (40-0), Westlake (16-13 in overtime), Burbank (28-23) and Grant (31-30), the Golden Eagles rejoiced after quarterback Zach LaBar passed to Cody Otten for the winner. Otten knocked down a Logan fourth-down pass in the end zone a moment later.LaBar also threw to Tyler Meteer for a touchdown, and reserve Dylan Kainrath rushed for 80 yards. He has been playing for starting tailback Brandon Monroe (strained knee).""We really needed it,"" Del Oro coach Casey Taylor said of his 1-4 team. ""We were so close to being 3-1 (before Friday).

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/03/16/4342459/hometown-report-mayor-kennedy.html,"Thirty years ago, Dave Parsh ambled home from workouts exhausted. He had to guard Sacramento High School teammate and future NBA star Kevin Johnson in practice. Parsh wasn't nearly as quick as Johnson, the state's scoring leader.Even now, the former teammates share a bond of work ethic and execution.Johnson is the Sacramento mayor basking in the glow of plans for a new arena.Parsh is the girls basketball coach at Kennedy, which is one win away from a CIF Northern California Division I championship.The Cougars are a lot like their coach a generation ago: scrappy, fundamentally sound and smart.And decided underdogs.Kennedy braces for the top-seeded Berkeley Yellowjackets, who seek a record 11th NorCal large-school title, on Saturday night at Power Balance Pavilion.Parsh and Johnson played for coach Ron McKenna, whose motto has always been to compete relentlessly.""I always paired Kevin and Dave against each other in those practices because I knew Dave would really push K.J.,"" said McKenna, a retired educator and coach who's still close to Parsh. ""Dave was fiercely competitive, intense, and he helped develop Kevin. Basketball worked out great for both of them.""Johnson went on to set scoring and assists records at Cal and become a 1987 first-round pick in the NBA, where he logged a successful 12-year career.Parsh led St. Francis to a state Division III championship in 1993 - plus league and section titles - before coaching at American River College and Yuba College. He found his calling to be the preps, including the past three seasons at Kennedy.The Cougars, who are 7-0 in the postseason, have little scholarship talent outside of junior wing Lynette Johnson, but they are loaded with heart. They know how to share the ball and defend.Lynette is the focus of every defense she faces, but she insists her teammates are dangerous.""You want to focus on me?"" Lynette said of swarming defenses. ""I've got four teammates who are all capable.""Sitting nearby was a proud McKenna.""That's Dave understanding that the name of the game is still fundamentals,"" McKenna said.Said Parsh: ""Everything I learned from basketball, I learned from coach McKenna.""And everything K.J. learned?""From me, and I'm sure he'd say the same thing,"" Parsh said, laughing.""Dave may tell you he had to guard me every day in practice at Sac High, though the reverse was also true - I had to guard Dave,"" Kevin Johnson said. ""We had a lot of success together, but it just didn't happen during the games. Any athlete will tell you, the practice and preparation make your success possible. Dave was a huge part of every win we had.""Johnson and McKenna appreciated Parsh then and now. ""He's a super coach, so proud of him,"" McKenna said.Said Johnson: ""I've followed his career as a coach, and I'm not the least bit surprised about the accomplishments of his teams and players. He's the kind of coach who makes individual players better while building a team, which is not as easy as it sounds. He builds winners for the future, in many different ways."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/05/22/4506300/cap-stage-offers-dark-tense-how.html,"Paula Vogel's knotty, time-shifting memory play ""How I Learned to Drive"" takes a meandering road to a gloomy lesson learned for its main character, Li'l Bit. Vogel's wildly praised 1997 meditation on sexual attraction, inappropriate complicity, and the complexity of our emotions bounces around in the mind of the ironically named Li'l Bit as she uneasily revisits the manipulative relationship her Uncle Peck slyly maintained with her. In the crisply executed new production at Capital Stage, Stephanie Gularte's teenage Li'l Bit and James Hiser's adult Peck are haunted specters in the play's defining central relationship. The connection can be played in many ways with varying degrees of light and darkness, given the depth and subtle layers in Vogel's script. Here, in director Janis Stevens' tense, melancholy staging, Gularte and Hiser are doomed characters locked into a damaging, convoluted game of sexual cat and mouse.While there's no doubt that Peck preys on Li'l Bit as only a pedophile would, Vogel doesn't completely demonize him. Peck's really the only person in Li'l Bit's life who talks to her or understands her, including the insensitive girls her own age. As much as she wants to, Li'l Bit can't disengage from Peck's attention. In their family, she's either ridiculed for her budding physicality or demeaned for having aspirations that reach beyond their rural Maryland upbringing. The often comic Greek chorus that plays family members and helps narrate Li'l Bit's story is made up of Jamie Jones, Melanie Marshall and Eric Wheeler. The family holds on to a late-1950s sensibility even though the story mostly takes place in the mid-'60s. But an enlightened sensitivity and sincerity are the alcoholic Peck's province. There's a lot of the old-fashioned Southern gentleman about him, and when Hiser smiles broadly as he often does, his whole face lights up. Peck is married to Li'l Bit's aunt and has known the girl since she was infant  since, as he says in the play, he could hold her in the palm of his hand. As much as he openly lusts after his niece, Peck says nothing will happen unless she wants it to.The scenes move back and forth through Li'l Bit's adolescent life and uneasy relationship with Peck, finally culminating in a revelatory 18th birthday party celebration that he's solemnly prepared for her in a hotel room.There are clear parallels for this work, including Vladimir Nabokov's ""Lolita,"" which Vogel said inspired her as she presented the story from the female point of view. David Harrower's torturous ""Blackbird,"" which presents a revelatory view of a similar relationship between an older man and an underage girl, also offered inspiration.Director Jonathan Williams designed the impressionistic set, and this dark fable seductively gets into your head.HOW I LEARNED TO DRIVE three 1/2 starsWhat: Capital Stage produces Paula Vogel's 1998 Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy-drama.

Joe Barton, R-Texas, who apologized to BP last summer during the Gulf oil spill and then backtracked under pressure from GOP leaders, has failed in his effort to be named the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee in the 112th Congress.The House GOP Steering Committee, controlled by House incoming Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, selected Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., to chairman the committee instead.In a statement, Barton said: ""It has been a privilege to serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee for 24 of my 26 years in the House of Representatives, and it was a high honor to lead this committee.""Now I want to offer my congratulations to Fred, who is taking over the best committee in Congress. He has an enormous job ahead, and I'm going to do everything I know how to make his chairmanship the kind of success that the American people want and expect.""Barton ran an energetic campaign, arguing that the three-term limit to be the top Republican on the panel should not be applied since he only served one term as chairman, but Upton prevailed. There were two other candidates: Reps. John Shimkus of Illinois and Cliff Stearns of Florida.Barton has the opportunity to object Wednesday during the GOP Conference meeting, called to ratify the selections of committee leaders. If he or someone objects to any chairman recommendation, then all incoming Republicans will vote whether or not to send the choice back to the steering committee.Upton said in a statement: ""We face many challenges, but priority number one is to repeal the job-killing Obama-care law. While the various subcommittee posts will be filled in the days ahead, the fight to repeal Obama-care starts now and I am pleased to appoint Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., as chairman of the health subcommittee. Together, we will protect the sanctity of life, ensuring early next Congress that no federal funds are used for abortion."""\u000a

V"Rudy Tomjanovich once said of his Houston Rockets after coaching them to an NBA championship two decades ago, ""Never underestimate the heart of a champion.""Joey Rollings can second that thought at the high school level with the same measure of exhausted glee.His gritty, determined Sheldon Huskies rallied from a 17-point first-half deficit to topple Jesuit 61-56 Saturday night in a historic Northern California Division I championship game at Power Balance Pavilion.Needing to beat their Delta River League rivals a seventh consecutive time and a fourth time this season, the Huskies showed remarkable resolve and poise in a game the Marauders owned early. Sheldon closed with a 12-2 run to become the first Sac-Joaquin Section public school to win a large-school boys NorCal title.What's more, this was the first time in the 30-year history of the NorCal tournament that two Sacramento-area larger-school boys teams played for a title, a show of strength for a region that for years has been buckled by the traditional powers of the Bay Area.Jesuit, a senior-dominated team, was determined to reverse fortunes with one final title chance. But the Huskies would have none of it, and now they have a chance to make more history. Sheldon (29-5) will take on national power Mater Dei of Santa Ana next Saturday at Power Balance for a shot to become the Sac-Joaquin Section's first D-I state boys champion.""I'm very proud of these guys,"" a spent Rolling said before scooping up his equally sweaty 3-year-old son, Tristan, for a celebratory hug. ""Some thought maybe we were too young this year, but they're all warriors.""Sheldon is indeed young with a junior-dominated lineup, but it is seasoned, confident and increasingly battle-tested. Dakarai Allen, Sheldon's smooth, unflappable junior guard who scored 16 points, scored on a putback to pull the Huskies within 56-55 with 1:50 to go. He followed with a steal, was fouled and made two free throws to give his team the lead for the first time  and for good  at 57-56.Nate Iese, the national football recruit headed to UCLA, sank two of the ugliest free throws in tournament history by his own admission for a 59-56 lead with 1:20 left, and free throws by Allen and team leader and point guard D'Erryl Williams capped the victory.Two weeks ago, Williams took over down the stretch as Sheldon beat Jesuit for a section title three-peat. Saturday, he took over in the second half with more inspired play. The junior had only two points at halftime as Sheldon made just 8 of 25 shots. But he finished with a game-high 23 points with six rebounds, willing his team to compete.""I wanted it so bad  we all did,"" Williams said. ""Didn't want to lose. We worked too hard for this.""Said an admiring Allen: ""I'm so proud of this team. We didn't want it to end. And D'Erry  I love that guy. He's the best player in Sacramento. No one can stop him.""Kyi Thomas had 10 points, Iese scored four, and Antonio Lewis again came off the bench to provide a big boost, scoring eight.Jesuit (27-7) was led by its senior core of Akachi Oguko (12 points), Parker Uu (12), Kurt Parker (12), Bryce Pressley (10) and Brian Glodowski (five). Uu fouled out with 1:59 to go, his team ahead 56-53.Jesuit coach Greg Harcos implored his players to keep their heads up after the game, to be proud of their effort and to appreciate the rivalry at hand.There was no shame in losing to Sheldon, the section power these days itching for one more win to cap what has already been a storybook season for this region."\u000a

V"There are many rock bands that perform for charity or support various causes. Styx makes it local. This band calls it ""Rock to the Rescue.""""There's always a demand for memorabilia,"" said vocalist and Styx keyboardist Lawrence Gowan. ""So, every performance, we auction something off, usually a signed guitar, and the money goes to a local charity. It's always local, wherever we play.""And Styx plays everywhere. Gowan called from the beginning of Styx's annual tour, which started last month in New Orleans, where the band has begun a tour each of the last five years. It is one of the most popular touring bands in the world, and its music has been heard on ""South Park,"" ""Freaks and Geeks"" and even a Volkswagen commercial (""Mr. Roboto""). ""We do about 100 shows a year,"" said Gowan, ""and the size of the venue does not matter. We like to play the more intimate theaters like the House of Blues where we are now, and we like the big arenas like the Tokyo Bowl and the Super Bowl. We're comfortable anywhere.""They'll play the Silver Legacy in Reno tonight in what the club calls the Grande Exposition Hall, a large downstairs convention space converted for concerts. Gowan sums up the venue with the comment that ""it's not a great room, but it's a great atmosphere the room generates.""It's in-your-face with the audience.""The band, known for the hits ""Come Sail Away,"" ""Babe"" and ""Too Much Time on My Hands"" and albums such as ""Pieces of Eight"" (1978) and ""Paradise Theater"" (1981), has toured more since its regrouping in 1997 than it ever did when it was at the apex of a recording career. The fans just keep coming ""and they just keep invigorating us. We become just as addicted as the audience when we perform, and we always end with a great sense of accomplishment,"" Gowan said.""It never becomes routine. There's always the unexpected. After all, I play on this spinning piano, and it's spun off, and I've fallen off, and I've whacked my head.""That pleases the audience even more.""

No wonder.Hannon offers a rare opportunity to see someone who has been so prominent in a small venue for free. He is best-known as co-founder of Tesla. Recently, he has also been performing solo ""acoustic"" shows featuring his music from albums ""Gypsy Highway"" and the recent ""Six-String Soldiers.""As Sacramento-born Hannon grew up, he learned to play guitar from his mother, along with the drums and the organ. He also clearly listened to a wide variety of music because, even though he is most closely associated with heavy rock, he performs some storytelling music directly related to folk traditions personified by Bob Dylan or John Denver.Hannon has performed with Dickey Betts, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Pat Travers and Night Ranger, among many.

In the past 14 seasons, St. Francis has played in 12 section title matches and won 10.Winning doesn't get old for Wright.""We have many steps to go, but this is exciting,"" she said.Wright feels the work the team does behind closed doors breeds intensity and focus in front of crowds.""This group of girls has worked very, very hard,"" Wright said. ""The chemistry is great, and they get along very well. The thing that helps is that we battle in our gym day in and day out.""Led by seniors Gabby Palmeri, Allie Wegener and Loni Kreun, St. Francis looks to better its Northern California semifinal finish last season, hoping for a shot at its first state title since 2005 in D-III.St. Francis was awarded the top seed in the D-I NorCal bracket and will play host to No. 8 Skyline-Oakland in the first round Tuesday night.Granite Bay was seeded No. 2 but will play at Lowell-San Francisco on Tuesday because Lowell was a section champion.

For the last few years, a fence at that corner has been draped with an advertisement for downtown activities.""The murals on the 800 block are the start of a conversation with the community and a way to make small  albeit cosmetic  short-term changes in the physical environment,"" said Michael Ault, the executive director of the Downtown Sacramento Partnership.That corner is at the center of the city's redevelopment effort on K Street's most downtrodden stretch. The city spent years  and millions of dollars  acquiring properties on the 700 and 800 blocks of K Street before granting them to two development teams in 2010.But work has been slow on the blocks as financing became difficult to find during the economic downturn and redevelopment dollars disappeared.Bay Miry, whose D Development is partnering with CFY Development on a plan to bring 137 apartments, restaurants and retail to the 700 block, said that construction could begin this summer.Teams are in the process of securing financing for housing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Once that is in hand, Miry said, he is confident financing for the retail elements would become available as well.Among the entertainment spaces planned for the 700 block are a music venue and bar operated by the owners of the Shady Lady Saloon on R Street.Restaurants are also in the plans for the block, and Miry said he has interest in operating venues from local chefs Adam Pechal (of Tuli Bistro and Restaurant Thir13en and currently competing on ABC's ""The Taste"") and Billy Ngo (executive chef and owner of Kru sushi)."\u000a

The run, which included three-pointers by freshmen Alana Myers and Aliceah Hernandez and senior Allie Green, made sure there would be no comeback or threat to a league winning streak that is now 84 games.""Our challenge, which I stressed to them at halftime, was that we've got to take it personal when people make runs on us,"" Massari said.

I thought we did a good job of that in the third quarter.""Junior Chaya Durr, who finished with a game-high 16 points, set the tone opening the second half.The rangy, 5-foot-10, quick-handed guard scored the half's first eight points for a 34-15 advantage, including back-to-back steals that she converted into layups. Durr was 7 for 13 from the field, mostly on slashing drives.""Chaya is going to be a phenomenal player, a major-level kid,"" Massari said.Sacramento's freshman trio of Hernandez (nine points), Myers (eight points) and point guard Andrea Butler played key roles, too, but McClatchy's youth also was evident.The Lions (17-2, 5-2) have had six underclassmen playing key roles. Under second-year coach Jessica Kunisaki, the Lions are enjoying their best season since 2009-10, when they went 24-7 and lost to Kennedy in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I semifinals and to Berkeley in the CIF NorCal quarterfinals.That team was coached by Lions legend Harvey Tahara, now a member of the section's Hall of Fame.Kunisaki was a Bee All-Metro player for Tahara before going to compete at Chapman University in Southern California.""Jessica is doing a fabulous job,"" athletic director Rob Feickert said. ""I know they would have liked to play better tonight, but they'll bounce back.""Washington, a sophomore, led the Lions with 10 points, sophomore Lauren Nubla added nine points, and McClatchy's twin towers of 6-2 freshman Gigi Garcia and 6-2 sophomore Destiney Lee scored five each."\u000a

V"Deonard Wilson brokered a deal with his Grant High School boys basketball team this season, a scenario in which everyone cashes in.The Pacers' coach stipulated that should his gritty and athletic bunch earn a Sac-Joaquin Section trip to Sleep Train Arena, thus signifying the cusp of a championship, he'd reward them with good eats. As in a visit to IHOP  International House of Pancakes.Pass the bibs. The Pacers are ready to feed.On the strength of De'Sean Parsons' remarkable all-around game, including scoring the only points in overtime, Grant outlasted Cosumnes Oaks 63-59 Friday in Del Paso Heights in a second-round Division II playoff game that was as entertaining as it was exhausting.In the end, the senior starting lineup of Parsons, Malek Wren (12 points), Malek Mitschem (11), Brandon Nunn (10 rebounds) and Kameron Bradley (five points, seven rebounds) squeezed out the program's first 2-0 playoff start since the 1999 team, the last Pacers squad to win a conference championship.As steady as his teammates are, the versatile, 6-foot-6 Parsons is the leader in terms of effort and production. He scored a game-high 25 points, had 14 rebounds, blocked six shots, handled the ball, hustled on defense and gave it every last ounce of effort, including diving head long onto the floor for a loose ball.""I have to play like this because I'm a leader,"" Parsons said. ""We know we have to play hard.""Grant now draws top-seeded Sacramento, the winner of five section D-III titles since 2005 and seeking its first in D-II.Mitschem hit the second of two free throws with a second to play in regulation to force overtime. So frenetic was the tempo for both sides just to get to that point, the teams were on fumes in the extra period.Parsons scored on a drive with 38.1 seconds left to play for the first extra-session points, then blocked a shot, hustled after the loose ball, was fouled and hit a free throw for a 62-59 lead. He came up with another block on the Wolfpack's final effort, got the rebound, was fouled and hit the final free throw.""He has a great motor,"" Wilson said. ""Since his freshman year, he told us that we'd go to Arco Arena. Now we're here. It's been a long time since Grant has been this far. We're bringing it back.""If Parsons is the clear star, then Wren, a quick, steady guard, is the facilitator and calming influence, Wilson said.""Wren runs this team,"" Wilson said. ""He sets the pace. He gets on everyone. Even if De'Sean acts like a diva, it's Wren who asks him, 'Is it me or we?' and DeSean will say, 'OK, Dog. We know it's we.' ""Alex Van Dyke led Cosumnes Oaks with 14 points and 12 rebounds."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2011/04/18/3560152/a-year-after-the-bp-spill-drilling.html,"One year later, the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history looks more and more like just a big bump in the road in the drive to drill deeper in the Gulf of Mexico and potentially closer to Floridas coastline.The Deepwater Horizon disaster killed 11 rig workers, spewed 60,000 barrels of oil a day for four months, cost five states billions of dollars in lost jobs and business, slimed marshes, beaches and wildlife from the Louisiana bayou to the Florida Panhandle, and left lingering toxic stains across complex food webs that scientists say will take years to fathom.A presidential commission report, issued in January, blamed just about every aspect of the offshore drilling industry  lapdog federal regulators, safety shortcuts by the British oil giant BP and its contractors and a high-risk wildcat culture that pushed companies into more dangerous depths without capable backup containment options.Yet in the months since the anxious, ugly summer of the monster slick, political tide and public opinion seem to have shifted. One recent poll suggests growing support in Florida for drilling. A slew of proposals to tighten regulations or hike fees and fines on the industry have stalled in Congress. The Obama administration has slowly cracked open the Gulf door but  a week before the April 20 anniversary of the blowout  a House committee passed three bills pushing faster and wider access.Some of the members of Congress are acting as though the Deepwater Horizon well oil spill never happened, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters.For environmentalists, scientists and other critics of the offshore drilling industry who had hoped to see drilling bans or sweeping reforms, the turnabout is disappointing and unexpected.Some people have gotten amnesia and washed their hands of any responsibility for action, said Bob Graham, the former Democratic Florida governor and senator who co-chaired the presidential commission.Hes worried that the talk of further expansion in the Gulf could renew efforts to drill off Floridas coast, though nothing formal is on the table at the moment.The idea that were going to reverse 60 years of protection of our waters is incredible, and incredibly stupid, he said.The oil industry and its supporters argue the rich reserves of the Gulf are too vital not to pursue, as long as precautions are adopted to reduce risks. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, echoing many Republican colleagues, insisted the spill should not stand in the way of increasing domestic exploration.We need to recognize the BP oil spill as an extraordinary disaster, Rubio said, but it should not force us to adopt an energy strategy that keeps us addicted to foreign oil.But Rubio does support a congressional moratorium that now keeps rigs 125 miles from the Panhandle and 235 miles from Floridas west coast. Crafted by fellow Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, it expires in 2022 but some fear the boundary line could be redrawn or even erased before then.Read the full story at MiamiHerald.com"\u000a

The analysis will determine whether portions of the routes will be reopened to the public. The draft environmental analysis will be available online for public review and comment via the Eldorado National Forest website, www.fs.usda.gov/eldorado, according to a Forest Service news release.The Forest Service will hold three public open houses to informally discuss the draft document: 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. Feb. 26 at the Placerville Best Western Inn, 6850 Green Leaf Drive, Placerville; 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. March 5 at the Turtle Rock Community Center, 17300 State Route 89 in Markleeville; and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. March 6 at the Amador County Supervisors Office, 810 Court St., Jackson.Forest Supervisor Kathy Hardy stressed that the draft document does not represent a final decision.

V"As Morris Panych's new play ""In Absentia"" opens, a woman named Colette stands in a living room talking with her husband, Tom, who stands behind her. Though the two are having a conversation, it becomes apparent as other people enter the room that no one else sees or hears him. Throughout the play, Colette will converse with Tom, who has been missing in Colombia for nearly a year. It's a delicate conceit, which pays off beautifully in the finely nuanced new production at Sacramento's B Street Theatre.In this superb U.S. premiere of Panych's comedic drama, the audience is treated to an emotional roller-coaster ride through the heart and mind of a woman both deeply conflicted and deeply in love.As heavy as it sounds and affecting as it is, director Buck Busfield's production has an uplifting vibrancy coming from an embracing narrative, performed by a disarmingly stunning ensemble. Centered on Elisabeth Nunziato's resolute Colette, the fluid production tracks back and forth through her steady memory and the desultory present as she comes to terms with the reality of Tom's (Kurt Johnson) disappearance. Though cerebral and often melancholy, Colette actively pursues life, grabbing tightly to the love she and Tom shared. The relationship was not always ideal, and though Panych provides depth in the writing, Nunziato unaffectedly animates and extends the character in a bravura performance.Breaking the seal on Colette's isolation at the edge of a frozen lake (she lives in remote Canada) is young, mysterious stranger Jasper (Dan Fagan). Jasper knows more about Colette than he should and slowly reveals that his recent movements mirrored Tom's before the disappearance. Fagan brings a sly, combustible ambiguity to Jasper as he insinuates himself into the household where Colette's sister Evelyn (Jamie Jones) is also staying. Colette's helpful neighbor Bill (David Pierini), openly in love with her, ineffectually watches as Jasper becomes the curious object of Colette's affection and attention. It all happens with seamless jumps of time, narrative and consciousness that keep the audience eagerly leaning forward to stay with the continually morphing story. The ensemble's magic makes it all unfold seemingly spontaneously in front of us, but more deeply, almost as if it were in our minds instead of onstage. Their perfect timing, popping in and out of doors, feels like carefully rehearsed farce, where each entrance hits on a line for maximum effect. Here, it's the work of a mutably in-synch, virtuoso ensemble.Johnson's stately simplicity adds to his overflowing body of outstanding work, while Jones and Pierini create masterful individual portraits. At any time you can look around the intimate B Street stage and see the story powerfully unfolding in every character's face and physical presence.Though ""In Absentia"" just had its world premiere in Montreal in February, Panych substantially revised the script for the version Busfield and co-director Laura Baker worked with at B Street. While the story deals with profound loss, it's much more about the redemptive power of love than the difficult process of grief.IN ABSENTIA 4 starsWhat: In the U.S. premiere of the new play by Morris Panych, the audience takes an emotional roller-coaster ride through the mind of a woman encountering a mysterious young drifter who may hold the key to her husband's disappearance.

V"Pol Brennan gives what he calls ""the short version of the long version"" when he talks about the Irish band Clannad, which consists of him, his two siblings Moya and Ciaran, and their two uncles, Padraig and Noel Duggan. Clannad plays tonight at John Ascuaga's Nugget.""We've been going for over 35 years,"" Brennan said. ""Our base was folk music. We all had a lot of classical training as well, though, and we had a lot of success with different scores.""Of Clannad's music, Brennan said, ""It's difficult to pigeonhole it,"" noting that it includes ""a lot of acoustic rock, a lot of chanting.""The Duggans, who are Brennan's mother's brothers, ""came out of the bogs in County Donegal,"" Brennan said. A long Irish name derived from their home town of Gaoth Dobhar (pronounced GWEE'-dore) was compacted into Clannad, and they recorded six traditional Irish albums between 1973 and 1980.In 1979 and 1980, the band was joined by a younger Brennan sister  a lass by the name of Enya  who eventually went on to her own highly successful solo career.The different scores Brennan refers to include those for successful British series like ""Harry's Game"" and ""Robin of Sherwood,"" along with the song ""I Will Find You"" from ""The Last of the Mohicans."" Bono joined the group for ""In a Lifetime""; Steve Perry and Bruce Hornsby, along with others, joined it for ""Sirius."" The success of Clannad's 1991 album ""Anam"" was highlighted by the single ""Ri Na Cruinne (King of the Universe),"" which was part of the BBC's ""One World One Voice"" campaign, in which Clannad was joined by the likes of Sting, Peter Gabriel and the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra.Clannad is working on a new album and is on its first tour in 18 years. Brennan considers it ""a joy to be on stage again,"" he said. ""We'll be doing material that goes back to albums Americans may not have heard"" (8 p.m.; $28; 800-648-1177 or janugget.com).Nevada Day and HalloweenHalloween means more in Nevada than any other state because it also marks the state's birthday  this year is its 148th.

V"Chris Fahey's cellphone is beyond blowing up. It's about to melt.The Jesuit High School athletic director is fielding calls, text messages and emails about his school's sudden football vacancy.With Dan Carmazzi leaving Jesuit after 34 seasons for his alma mater, Christian Brothers, the buzz within the prep community has been twofold: How does Carmazzi revive a CBS program that hasn't won a playoff game since 1986, and who takes over at Jesuit? Everyone, it seems, is offering Fahey suggestions.""I've heard every big name in town,"" Fahey said.Jesuit hasn't formally reached out to anyone, but alumni have certainly reached out to coaches around the state, dropping names in hopes of drumming up an all-star cast of candidates. Jesuit can be a gem of a job with plenty of motivated students, booster support, feeder programs and tradition. And Fahey added it is not imperative that Jesuit hire a coach with parochial ties.Friday, Jesuit football players said they heard that Kris Richardson of Folsom had signed on with the Marauders. Not true, and Richardson is content at Folsom with young sons coming up through the football ranks.Many readers wondered when The Bee would announce Casey Taylor of Del Oro had been named the new coach. More wild speculation. Taylor has a great thing going in Loomis but is wise to listen when other programs call for a chat.Other names that have come up: Joe Cattolico of Pleasant Grove, Mike Johnson of Franklin, Chris Nixon of Elk Grove, Joey Montoya of Placer, Drew Rickert of Bradshaw Christian, Mike Gimenez of Whitney, Chris Jones of Vista del Lago, Eric Cavaliere of Oak Ridge, Ernie Cooper of Granite Bay and Mike Alberghini of Grant. Alberghini's preferred shade of red isn't that of Jesuit, but the one on his face on the sideline while he coaches his beloved Pacers.Each of these coaches is established and successful at his school, and it can be argued a switch to Jesuit is not a move up. Also, the coaches on this list play on Friday nights before large crowds and rabid community-linked atmosphere.Despite all that Jesuit offers, its Saturday afternoon home games have become bland. Even the rooting section has steered clear. Jesuit is exploring an upgrade to its football facilities and perhaps playing some ""home"" Friday night games on another campus. Installing lights at Jesuit is no easy or affordable task.Other names linked to rumors include John Volek, the former Sacramento State coach and retired Sierra College athletic director. Volek is intriguing, but he also promised his wife, Vicki, that he'd never be a head coach again. She prefers him home cooking and helping shepherd the grandkids.Another is Ed Lombardi. The retired Elk Grove and Sheldon coach with 200-plus wins is exceptional in bonding a community and campus to the football team.Fighting chanceSacramento City College's baseball team won't be short of motivation today. The Panthers (18-18) host Butte (20-16) in a single-elimination Northern California Regional play-in game at 2 p.m., keeping their playoff streak alive since 1976 and looking to extend another. Sac City last suffered a losing season in 1970 at 13-15.Around the region Cosumnes River College's baseball team won the competitive Big 8 Conference at 15-9. Santa Rosa, Diablo Valley, Sierra and Sac City finished within two games and Delta and Modesto within three games. Even more remarkable was that coach Tony Bloomfield's team did not have a practice or game on campus because of construction of CRC's new facility. The Hawks (20-15) will be the home team in a NorCal Regional best-of-three series against Sequoias (23-13) starting Saturday at American River. Also, Sierra (20-15-1), the 2008 state champion, will open at Laney of Oakland (28-7). Football will be the talk of the day on the golf course for the Kris Fontes Memorial Golf Tournament at 8 a.m. on Monday at Whitney Oaks Golf Club in Rocklin. Among the 36 foursomes: former Elk Grove High stars Ryan Dinwiddie and Lance Briggs."\u000a

Other than a quick stir every now and then, it just simmers happily on the stove. The idea of bacon jam might seem a little weird. But I assure you that it not weird at all. It is rich and complex, sweet and smoky, citrusy and syrupy. After I made it, I was thinking about all of the things that I could spread it on. A biscuit, slathered in a grilled cheese sandwich, or on a hamburger. I bet that it would even be really good on pancakes or waffles.

V"House Republicans, among them the head of a key oversight panel, threatened Friday to call Cabinet secretaries and other executive agency managers before congressional hearings on how furloughs are applied in the wake of forced spending cuts. The lawmakers warned President Barack Obama against choosing political gain over public safety in deciding which federal employees are assigned the periods of unpaid leave as a result of $85 billion in automatic cuts that began Friday. If theyre laying off TSA agents and air-traffic controllers, and yet (Transportation Secretary) Ray LaHoods office is still getting cleaned each night, come on, said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chairman of the regulatory subcommittee of the House Oversight Committee. The fundamental mission of the president of the United States is to ensure the security of this nation, Jordan said. Thats got to be his top priority. Jordan said he and other leaders of oversight panels in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives may hold hearings to ask how the furloughs are applied if the lawmakers believe essential workers are being sent home before more peripheral employees. Rep. Tom Massie, R-Ky., said the government should freeze unmanned aerial surveillance within U.S. airspace before furloughing air-traffic controllers. We should put people in front of drones, Massie said. Republicans have accused Obama and Democratic congressional allies of trying to gain political advantage by painting doomsday scenarios about the immediate impact of the forced spending cuts, which the Republicans say amount to only 2.2 percent of this years projected $3.8 trillion federal budget. But about two-thirds of the total budget is exempt under the 2011 Budget Control Act, which requires $1.2 trillion in forced cuts over a decade if Congress cant find other reductions. The automatic cuts, called sequestration, were to have started Jan. 1 of this year, but a short-term deal pushed them back to March 1. The exempted spending  including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, and wages for active-duty troops  means that hundreds of discretionary military and non-defense programs will experience an effective hit of 6.6 percent or more. Obama kept up the pressure Friday, suggesting that the vast majority of federal workers are subject to furloughs regardless of their jobs. Hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve their country  Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the Pentagon  all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs, Obama told reporters at the White House. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., disputed Obamas claim. He pointed to recent guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, the human resources arm of the executive branch, that he said gives agency directors leeway to decide which employees get furloughed based on the importance of their work. A 35-page document titled Guidance for Administrative Furloughs says in part: Agencies are responsible for indentifying the employees affected by administrative furloughs based on budget conditions, funding sources, mission priorities (including the need to perform emergency work involving the safety of human life or protection of property) and other factors. A reporter asked Obama on Friday to respond to criticism from New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent who endorsed the presidents re-election but who suggested this week that the administration is exaggerating the spending cuts impact. The Border Patrol agents who are out there in the hot sun, doing what Congress said theyre supposed to be doing, finding out suddenly that theyre getting a 10 percent pay cut and having to go home and explain that to their families  I dont think they feel like this is an exaggerated impact, Obama said. So I guess it depends on where you sit. From where many Republican lawmakers sit, Obama was hawking unduly bad news to get Americans on his side in the larger budget battles that have stymied Washington. On the non-defense side, the overall spending level this year is 12 percent higher than when Barack Obama came into office four years ago, so even after the cuts, these agencies will be spending more than they did then, even on an inflation-adjusted basis, said Rep. John Campbell, R-Calif."\u000a

V"BILOXI -- Local government leaders are defending what has been called a shopping spree with millions of dollars of emergency grants from BP, saying they were uncertain what they needed for the unprecedented disaster and didnt want to be caught ill-equipped.According to a database of spending compiled by the Associated Press, they bought fleets of expensive SUVs and trucks, boats, personal watercraft, all-terrain vehicles -- even kayaks and a motor home -- and bedecked them with gadgets of every description. They paid government workers overtime and special compensation and hired scores of consultants. All this despite Mississippis shoreline being mostly spared the feared deluge of oil.Much of the equipment would have been needed if large amounts of oil had washed in, local leaders said, and it is being put to use in day-to-day government operations. Some governments, such as Bay St. Louis, Moss Point and Waveland, appeared to be frugal with BPs money. But some of the governments purchases appear to have little direct correlation to the oil disaster and frugality appears not to have been a top consideration.

V"GULFPORT, Miss.  The BP oil spill is one year old this week. The whole disaster killed or injured 28 rig workers, thousands of birds and hundreds of marine animals, and spewed 200 million gallons of crude into the Gulf over three months.The disaster has helped to focus an intense spotlight on a Gulf already suffering from human encroachment. Between 4,000 and 8,000 square miles of sea bottom die each summer from lack of oxygen and coastal wetlands the size of Rhode Island have been lost in Louisiana in recent decades.Yet beaches along the northern Gulf attract billions in tourism dollars, the seafood industry supports thousands of families and the waters act as a nursery for many species, some that only breed in the Gulf.In the year since the disaster, BP has continued to manage the event, promising restoration and holding out that both the environment and peoples livelihoods will be made whole eventually.Meanwhile, an army of federal and state agencies are on a fact-finding mission to tally the damage to natural resources and encourage BP to make restitution in a process that is growing by the day, with more than 30,000 samples collected and tens of thousands of other pieces of evidence involved.Its a process that has been successful with smaller spills in getting oil companies to pay without going to court.But there are so many kinds of damage with the BP spill that hundreds of lawsuits have been filed. After all, NOAAs Troy Baker in the assessment division said last week, No one has faced a region-wide oil spill before. We have a region-wide set of impacts, from the ecology to human use of the Gulf.Its that same process, however, that is creating a type of gag order on findings from the Gulf  keeping scientists who are contributing to the Natural Resource Damage Assessment quiet until all is settled, which could be years. And that comes while other noted scientists are working for BP.The process is leaving those who live along the northern Gulf distrusting of government, optimistic about the beaches and this years crop of seafood, but leery that what lies below the surface of the Gulf in the water and on the sea floor will haunt them for decades and generations.Read the full story at SunHerald.com"\u000a

V"Reader Robert Zuniga recently saw a fire engine, with lights and siren, forced to stop on 29th Street in midtown for a half-minute while two light-rail trains crossed the street.He asks: Is that what we want, emergency vehicles blocked from providing quick aid to residents in trouble?No, definitely not, local officials say.Trains have been trundling through the urban area for eons, crossing streets, forcing commuters and even emergency vehicles to stop and wait. Police and fire crews say they don't like it, but they have learned to compensate for it.Regional fire dispatchers say they get radio reports about five times a month from engines or firetrucks that are being delayed by passing trains. Spokeswoman Michelle Eidam of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District says firefighters usually wait like everybody else for Regional Transit light-rail trains to pass  or almost like everybody else.They can jump ahead of the other cars in line if there is room, then go through first when the gates go back up.""It's a minimal problem,"" is how Eidam described the light-rail issue.If a major incident is going to require a lot of emergency vehicles to cross tracks, Eidam said, the Fire Department can ask RT to halt service for a while to allow back-and-forth emergency movement.Freight trains are far less frequent, but they pose more of a problem. Some trains have 80 cars and can cause five-minute-plus delays.In those cases, fire officials say, the fire apparatus driver will report the delay, and dispatchers will send another engine company from the other side of the tracks to the call.Union Pacific has an emergency number for police and fire to call to alert them of issues at or near tracks.Trains have federal right of way when crossing streets here and elsewhere.Sacramento officials have said in the past they'd like Union Pacific to reroute trains around the metro area. But the rail company isn't inclined to spend the money to do that.City officials have talked of tunneling some streets under the tracks, but that's expensive and would disrupt neighborhoods.Sacramento Regional Transit and Sacramento County have, however, created grade separations at several major streets over the years, including Power Inn Road and more recently Watt Avenue just south of Folsom Boulevard, to eliminate commute congestion caused by train crossings.A planned light-rail line south to Cosumnes River College includes a bridge steering it over CRC Boulevard at Bruceville Road.Trains aren't the only impediment to emergency vehicles. ""You can say the same about rush-hour traffic,"" Sacramento police spokesman Officer Doug Morse said."\u000a

V"The Franklin Wildcats may have edged their way into the sectionals after a trying season, but on Wednesday they made their mark as a serious contender.Franklin played like a team that has come of age in belting Bee No. 1 Pleasant Grove 11-5 at Sacramento City College in Sac-Joaquin Section Division I North play.""I really liked our chances and think we can be the best team in the section if we play like we can,"" Franklin coach Bryan Kilby said. ""Our guys really respond to adversity. They're fired up. It's a super group of kids.""The Wildcats (20-9) led 11-1 after their half of the third inning. They scored five in the first off Pleasant Grove ace Zach Stilwell, who has been dominant at times this season but hit three batters, walked three and surrendered three hits in the first. All told, Franklin smacked 15 hits, and Josh Pigg struck out five to earn the win.It's a far cry from when the Wildcats' bats were as cool as the weather to start the season. The Wildcats overcame a rocky March and finished third in a power-packed Delta Valley Conference that includes Elk Grove and Davis, placing them in a sectional play-in game Monday in Yountville that they won to advance.With Tyler Blake and Kyle Von Ruden now healthy and teaming with Brandon Keup, the pitching staff seems poised for a title run. Blake had three hits and three RBIs, Kyle Zanzi had three RBIs, Von Ruden drove in two, Connor Adams had two hits and Taylor Waters had two doubles.Pleasant Grove (22-6) had beaten Franklin 8-6 and 3-0 in nonleague games, and the Eagles also beat Oak Ridge twice and previous No. 1 Jesuit twice to win the Delta River League.""I didn't see this coming,"" Pleasant Grove coach Rob Rinaldi said. ""Matt Stafford pitched well (in relief) and had four zeroes on the scoreboard, but it was too late. It was a slow torture for us.""Vacaville 3, Jesuit 2  Elway Santistevan scattered six hits and his defense threw out a runner at the plate and picked two off the bases to stun Bee No. 2 Jesuit, eliminating the defending North champions.It is Vacaville's first playoff win since the 1990s after some crushing opening-game exits, including a 5-3 loss to Jesuit in 2007.Vacaville (18-9) lost to Pleasant Grove 4-3 and beat Davis 4-3 and Franklin 3-1 early this season in nonleague games.""We showed up here, we competed and we played well,"" Vacaville coach Abe Hobbs said. ""Elway doesn't pass the eye test, but that's a competitive young man.""Vacaville reliever Anthony Gonsolin struck out Zach Greene swinging with a runner on and two outs in the the seventh to end the game. Logan James struck out eight for Jesuit (20-8). For Vacaville, Gonsolin and Ben Gamba had RBIs and Santistevan had two hits."\u000a

""I didn't make the team, I couldn't play, and I was not eligible.""Ezeli ended up at Yuba College at 16, taking a basketball class among his courses. He was discovered by college scouts playing for the Sacramento Pharoahs AAU team and showed enough ability to land a scholarship.Now Ezeli has the chance to play in the NBA after four seasons with the Commodores.Not bad for someone who hasn't played basketball for 10 years of his life.""It's a dream,"" Ezeli said.

Ahmadinejad then attended the awards ceremony, shaking hands with some members of the U.S. team and posing for pictures.Iran's public sports broadcaster showed parts of the ceremony live.American wrestlers Obenson Blanc, Joseph Kennedy, Harold Metcalf, Jordan Burroughs, John Askren and Tervel Dlagnev won their matches against Belarus.

""In reality, it's a two-dog town with Pleasant Grove, too, and both have won section titles. To be the best, we've got to beat the best.""And Franklin beat the best Friday as Elk Grove came in ranked No. 1 in the Sac-Joaquin Section and second in Northern California by MaxPreps, with Franklin at No. 2 and 3 in those rankings, respectively.Franklin prevailed because its complete team was a bit better than Elk Grove (7-1, 2-1), which was without two-year starting quarterback Tommy Arnold, who was suspended for a locker-room fight while trying to retrieve his stolen cellphone.The Wildcats (8-0, 3-0) defense bunched up the box with nine men, daring the Herd to throw with backup Guy Hall, who completed one pass for three yards off a deflection.Still, even with Arnold at linebacker, his other position, Elk Grove would not have slowed Franklin. The Wildcats outgained the Herd 331-130 in total offense.Christian Fonbuena rushed for 81 yards and Kyran Harris had 65, including the icing 27-yard touchdown run for the final score early in the fourth quarter.Tre Lampley scored on a seven-yard run for Franklin and had 65 receiving yards. Quarterback Trent Spallas passed for 148 yards, connecting with Dionte Young for 97 of them.Led by Joey Banks and William Vi, Franklin has had a strong defense all season, too, a championship unit that allowed the hard-charging Robert Frazier to fight for 83 yards, but they came on 25 carries. Wadus Parker cut Franklin's lead to 10-7 for on a nine-yard touchdown run.""My kids were very serious this week in practice, most serious they've been,"" Johnson said. ""We even had Fonbuena and Harris take over on scout team and say, 'no, no, no. Frazier doesn't run like that for Elk Grove. He's much better. We'll show you.' ""Elk Grove aims to finish the regular season 9-1 and target a Division II section title after winning five in D-I. Franklin won its first playoff game last season, at Nevada Union, and now wants much more, such as a D-I title.The baseball team won the D-I North title and the good vibes of athletic success continue. Franklin packed the visitor's side at Elk Grove with boosters, parents, alumni and students.""Things are going great right now,"" Spallas said."\u000a

V"The wine shipments going out of Lodi's Woodbridge Winery on Feb. 14 were a first of their kind. The 3,500 cases were off to Brazil, marking the debut of Lodi wines in this large South American country, which drinks relatively little wine.Lodi's wine business community has increasingly sought trade partners with foreign countries, especially such rapidly growing markets as China and Hong Kong. Lodi vintners and business leaders have recently hosted multiple delegations from China to seek trade partners, hoping that Lodi can help satisfy the global demand for California wine.Brazil, however, would be considered a growing niche market. According to the Wine Institute, a San Francisco-based trade organization for California's wine industry, wine consumption in Brazil is a paltry 1.8 liters of wine per capita. That accounts for about 40,000 cases of wine shipped to Brazil annually  a tiny drop in the 47.2 million cases exported worldwide from the United States in 2012.Industry observers speculate that Brazil's hosting of the World Cup in 2014 and the 2016 Summer Olympics might boost these numbers. Either way, new trade partners for Lodi's wine region are especially welcome.""Brazil's economy has captured the attention of a lot of people and agricultural commodities, including wine,"" said Frank Gayaldo, a Lodi-based international business consultant who specializes in California agriculture. ""We think (Brazil) is an another example of these emerging markets becoming increasingly important.""Gayaldo is also eyeing Korea as an especially hot market for Lodi wine. Shipments of California wine were up 26 percent in 2012 over the previous year, according to the Wine Institute. A free-trade agreement signed in March 2012 between the United States and Korea has been viewed as a plus for Lodi's wine trade.""The challenge is there's so much opportunity and minimal time,"" said Gayaldo. ""I was super-excited to see those shipments go over to Brazil. China's my own personal focus, Korea's on my radar and Brazil's a market we should be paying attention to."""\u000a

V"After beating Clovis East 45-8 at home last Friday, No. 14 Inderkum will play host to Spanish Springs of Sparks, Nev., on Sept. 7 in Natomas.It's not that the Tigers are scheduling tough early games for possible postseason consideration for a Northern California Regional or State Bowl bid.Successful area programs such as Inderkum are finding it more of a challenge to find nonleague games.Much of that has to do with the Sac-Joaquin Section's 4-year-old playoff format that rewards teams in the postseason based primarily on regular-season wins, not strength of schedule.For teams in tough leagues, scheduling too many difficult nonleague opponents could mean missing the postseason.Inderkum has been primarily a Division III school, but because of its football success  a seven-season record of 71-14  schools of comparable size avoid the Tigers.""It's frustrating trying to schedule games,"" says Inderkum coach Terry Stark. ""We were sweating it a little bit because we were into April and May and we had only seven games on our schedule. Everyone has to get wins in the preseason.""It's meant Inderkum has had to find schools outside of the area  the Tigers also play host to Terra Nova of Pacifica on Sept. 28  or play up against larger-enrollment schools such as No. 4 Pleasant Grove, a D-I school, Sept. 14 at Inderkum.Despite its success, Inderkum has struggled to find a home audience. Playing three out-of-area opponents doesn't help boost interest.Stark isn't the only coach dealing with scheduling issues.Granite Bay coach Ernie Cooper says some schools are reluctant to play his team because the defending D-I section champions run the fly offense.""We never get that phone call, 'Hey come over here and play us,' "" said Cooper, whose No. 5 Grizzlies play CalHi Sports' state No. 4 Oaks Christian on Saturday in Westlake Village. ""Part of it is we've been pretty good. But some teams don't want to spend a game playing against an offense like ours if they are never going to see it again.""Burbank coach John Heffernan would prefer not to host No. 3 Grant (Sept. 7) and visit No. 6 Del Oro (Sept. 14) in back-to-back weeks because of the physical toll it may take. But he had little choice.Because of No. 12 Burbank's reputation for toughness, speed and its unorthodox triple option, Heffernan rarely gets return calls from coaches when he tries to schedule a game. It doesn't help that Burbank isn't a big road draw.""We're not Grant, Del Oro or Pleasant Grove, and teams know that on a good day, we can beat you,"" Heffernan said.More separation  Rio Linda's Mike Morris is amazed at how sophisticated year-round football has become through the years.There's not only a gulf between the haves and have-not programs  it's true for the haves and the lesser haves, too.Rio Linda has strong school and booster support with seven winning seasons in the past eight years, including a Division III section championship team in 2004.But after finishing the regular season 7-3 last season, the Knights were beaten by eventual section runner-up Folsom 56-19 in a D-II playoff opener. The Knights trailed 49-0 at the half.""We're fairly established and had a pretty good team, and look what happened to us,"" Morris said before No. 10 Folsom beat then-No. 20 Woodcreek 68-28 last Friday. ""My first year, we were 0-10, but even though we played some really good teams, the scores weren't nearly so lopsided.""So can you imagine that gap between the upper level and our downtrodden teams now?Services for Guerra  Memorial services for Dewey Guerra, the famed Cordova coach from the 1960s and '70s, will be held at 10 a.m. Friday at St. John Vianney Church in Rancho Cordova.

His misery had only just begun.Wenger undoubtedly had one eye on Arsenal's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich, last year's runner-up in the competition, when he named his starting squad for the FA Cup tilt.But according the Gunners manager, the team he fielded against Rovers was not weak at all, stating that every one of the 11 starters was a full international. He is not wrong, but the decision to leave any of Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott, Santi Cazorla and Lukas Podolski on the bench for a match that is essential to your best chance at silverware means that Wenger is certainly culpable.""Le Professeur"" lost once more when he participated in his press conference ahead of the Bayern match (http://ow.ly/hRKwo). When asked about the state of his contract negotiations with Arsenal, his team selection from Saturday, the subsequent loss to Blackburn and the prospect of another barren season for the Gunners' trophy cabinet, the normally cool and collected Wenger snapped with snide and sarcastic responses to legitimate journalistic inquiries.Apparently, dogs do walk on their hind legs.It didn't take Wenger long to effectively lose the Champions League tie as Bayern scored twice in the opening 21 minutes to put the Gunners on the back foot.Arsenal did manage to gain some momentum in the match, but it was erased by Mario Mandzukic's goal 13 minutes from time.The fact remains that minor comebacks like the one on display, in glimpses, at the Emirates on Tuesday only serve to salvage a modicum of pride. It does not change the facts that Arsenal was outclassed on the night and that Wenger's once-sterling reputation of developing young players into world-class talents has disappeared.The opening half-hour at the Emirates on Tuesday offered the greatest indication as to just how far Wenger has fallen from grace.Bayern bossed the match in a manner that was reminiscent of Wenger's early Arsenal squads. The Germans were fast, physically with their movement and mentally with their decision-making. They were skillful on the ball and accurate with their passing. But most of all, they had the physicality and aggression to match their superior size.This is how Arsenal's ""Invincibles"" were once described. Speed through Thierry Henry up front, skill from Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, complemented by Gilberto Silva's supreme passing ability and the combativeness of Patrick Vieira.Wenger has been beaten at his own game and Tuesday's match was the proof. His squad, formerly capable of winning any competition for which it qualified, has gradually weakened to the tepid Gunners we watch today.And whenever the Arsenal boss is able to develop a young player into a class talent, he typically bolts for greener pastures like Robin van Persie, Cesc Fabregas, Gael Clichy and Samir Nasri have done in recent years.By comparison, Bayern has been able to hold on to its crop of talented youngsters and they proved to be the difference in Tuesday's encounter at the Emirates. Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller, a pair of 23-year-olds who have been tremendously influential since graduating to the Bayern Munich first team, provided the goals that lifted the German giants to a two-goal advantage inside the opening 21 minutes.The point of who is at fault for Arsenal's tumble into mediocrity can be argued for hours on end.Did Wenger get his team selection wrong at critical times? Is he blameworthy for replacing the likes of Van Persie, Fabregas, Clichy and Nasri with slight- of-frame alternatives who have been thrust into the limelight very early on in their respective careers? Is it down to those replacements for under performing? Or does it come down to the Arsenal board for failing to adequately invest transfer funds in top-quality, experienced talent?Those who opine the latter are likely Wenger loyalists who remain firm in their credo ""In Arsene, We Trust.""But it cannot be disputed that Wenger has lost on three fronts.He took a gamble he did not need to take in fielding a weakened side against Blackburn, which resulted in elimination from a competition that gave Arsenal the best chance to win something this season.He lost the pre-match press conference before the Bayern clash, showing the ease with which he can be unnerved by a person with a recorder when his back is up against the wall.And he has struggled to adequately nurture young players and turn them into regular contributors, falling behind the curve to clubs like Bayern and setting Arsenal back years in the process.Wenger will lose again at the conclusion of the season when he makes it eight years for Arsenal without a trophy. His downfall will be completed when he subsequently loses his job."\u000a

V"WASHINGTON  Kenneth Feinberg, the head of the Gulf oil spill fund, said Monday that victims of the BP oil spill will have three options for final compensation from the Deepwater Horizon blowout, and all but one of them requires claimants to give up their right to sue.Oil from the damaged BP well gushed into the Gulf for three months, affecting all aspects of life on the Gulf Coast, from tourism to restaurants to the fishing industry to casinos.The three options would apply to the next phase of the compensation program, now that the emergency phase  which distributed $2.5 billion to more than 160,000 businesses and individuals in Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida and Texas  is complete.Under option one, the fund would make a final lump-sum payment based on documented damage, but claimants give up the right to sue. Under option two, claimants would get interim quarterly payments but reserve their legal recourse. Under option three, applicants who already have received emergency funds would get a quick payout of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for businesses without having to provide additional documentation, but they would have to give up the right to sue.""The goal in providing these three compensation alternatives is to give each and every eligible claimant an opportunity to choose which option is best,"" Feinberg said. ""The choice is purely voluntary.""Feinberg said that the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, as his operation is officially known, will provide legal counsel to advise claimants on the claims process, but not, however, to represent them in lawsuits. ""One size does not fit all,"" said Feinberg, who presided over the 9/11 victims' compensation fund. Claim forms will be available starting Friday, he said, both online and at the claims offices along the Coast. All options will be available until August 2013. BP funded the program with $20 billion after the White House demanded a compensation fund.In addition to providing lawyers, Feinberg said that he would be hiring ""live bodies""  local people who could assist applicants.He also stressed that people who had been denied compensation before, such as casino workers, should resubmit claims. ""We will give any claimant an opportunity to resubmit documentation,"" he said.Asked about the casino workers, who have staged demonstrations in Biloxi, Miss., over rejected claims, Feinberg said, ""I don't think they've been unfairly treated. . . . They have to document their damage.""Beverly Martin, the executive director of the Mississippi Casino Operators Association, said that very few of the 13,000 workers she represents were compensated under the emergency phase. She said that some workers in restaurants inside casinos got nothing, while workers in restaurants across the street were compensated.""The inconsistency  that's wherein lies the problem,"" she said, adding that the new plan ""is another step in the right direction.""Casino dealer Connie Penuel was denied payment but will ""absolutely"" file again. ""For Mr. Feinberg to come out and give an assessment that casinos are not directly related to tourism is wrong,"" Penuel said.Tom Becker, the president of the Mississippi Charter Boat Captain Association, said that, so far, ""a lot of the guys are very disappointed"" in the compensation fund.""We're getting (back what) we put in as proof of loss,"" he said, showing fishing charters that were canceled  but not ones that they would have been able to attract in a normal summer.MORE FROM MCCLATCHYTestimony: Poor cementing at BP well symptom of wider problemBP investigation cites multiple failures, but not well's designReport: White House squelched release of BP oil spill estimatesFeds lift moratorium on deepwater offshore oil drillingFollow the latest politics news at McClatchy's Planet Washington"\u000a

V"Linda Giguiere of Woodland is pretty attached to her puppy Charlie.""He's like a part of my left leg,"" she joked about her 1-year-old Brussels Griffon pooch.Still, Giguiere was looking for a way to make Charlie a bit less rambunctious. So on Sunday morning, she was one of hundreds of pet owners who dropped off their dogs and cats to be spayed or neutered at dramatically reduced prices in the Sacramento region, part of the 14th annual Spay Day.About 730 pets were surgically altered during Sunday's event, which offered low-cost veterinarian services to income-qualified residents.The nonprofit Sacramento Area Animal Coalition, which organizes Spay Day, reported that the surgeries took place at 20 locations in Sacramento and Yolo counties  16 veterinary clinics and four animal shelters.About 60 surgeries were scheduled at the Sacramento County animal shelter alone.Veterinarians, shelter employees and volunteers worked throughout the day, donating their time and services. For $15 a cat and $20 a dog, owners received about $250 worth of services, including the surgical alteration, vaccinations, permanent microchip placement and flea treatments.Coalition president Shannon Asquith said Spay Day has altered more than 8,300 animals in 14 years in the Sacramento area, preventing the potential for millions of births of animals.She said the event is paid for through sponsorships and private donations. The coalition's mission is to reduce animal overpopulation.""Spaying and neutering dogs and cats leads to better health and improved behavior, and reduces the number of animals entering area shelters,"" Asquith said. She estimated that Sunday's surgeries could prevent the births of 14,000 puppies and kittens in the next year.Giguiere, a senior citizen on a fixed income, said she checked area clinics to get Charlie neutered, but found that the surgery alone would cost more than $100. Then she found out she was eligible for a Spay Day surgery and services for $20.""You can't beat that,"" she said, after dropping off Charlie at the Hatton Veterinary Hospital on Sheldon Road in south Sacramento. ""I've been looking forward to getting this done. I think it will settle him down a bit. It's a wonderful service to take advantage of.""Cody Aguilar and Alex Manzo of Sacramento brought their 6-month-old tabby kitten Chimmy to the vet hospital to be neutered for $15.""It's a really good deal,"" Aguilar said. ""He's a very loving cat, but we needed to get this done.""This year's Spay Day was in honor of the late Sacramento County Animal Control Officer Roy Marcum, who was killed while checking on an evicted man's dog in a Galt home late last year, Asquith said."\u000a

Jeff Leach, R-Plano, is proposing to give Texans more of both.Leach has filed the ""Texas Gun Ownership Reinforcement Act,"" a bill to create a new tax-free holiday where consumers won't be charged taxes on guns, ammunition or hunting supplies one day out of the year:Texas Independence Day, March 2.""Texas must take the lead in the fight against the federal government's attempts to infringe on our Second Amendment rights,"" Leach said, adding that this bill gives ""law-abiding citizens, hunters and sportsmen the opportunity to save money on firearm and hunting equipment, benefiting Texas taxpayers and small business owners and spurring economic growth.""As we fight against the federal government's overreach, there is no more appropriate day to instate this tax-free holiday than on Texas Independence Day.""Gun control advocate Marsha McCartney said the bill is a bad idea.""I sometimes wonder if they just sit around late at night and try to think of some crazy bill when they have such important work to do,"" said McCartney, a spokeswoman for the Texas chapter of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""Maybe someone said, 'Hey, Texas has so much money, let's give these people a tax break.'""Leach's proposal comes as members of Congress are working to address President Barack Obama's call for the country's most aggressive gun control proposal in decades. The plan, developed in the wake of the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school in December, includes requiring background checks on all gun purchases, banning assault weapons and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds.Leach's bill -- which has drawn several co-authors, including Republican state Reps. Phil King of Weatherford and Jonathan Stickland of Bedford -- creates a definite contrast between Congress and the Texas Legislature.Leach's bill would make certain items exempt from taxes on March 2, including shotguns, rifles, pistols, revolvers, gun cleaning supplies, gun cases, gun safes, ammunition, archery equipment, hunting stands, blinds and decoys.Other states have similar programs in place.Louisiana, for instance, has had a Second Amendment Sales Tax Holiday weekend in September each year since 2010 that exempts firearms and related items from sales tax. That weekend costs the Pelican State around $600,000 a year, estimates show.""Many hunters and other gun owners, along with owners of businesses which cater to these individuals, are sure to appreciate the legislation, even if its chances of passage are remote,"" said Mark P. Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston. ""Holding the tax-free holiday on Texas Independence Day underscores the linkage between Second Amendment rights and the ability of citizens to protect themselves from tyranny.""Jones said he doesn't believe the bill, which he describes as ""symbolic,"" as having much of a chance of passing, especially at a time when state lawmakers are trying to stretch every penny as far as they can.But supporters say the time is right to push the bill.""What better way to express Texas's stand for constitutional principles than to recognize Texas Independence Day as a tax-free holiday for the very tools of self-defense the Constitution guarantees us,"" said King, one of the co-authors.The bill, which has been referred to the House Ways & Means Committee, has drawn support from the National Rifle Association.Allan Saxe, an associate political science professor at the University of Texas in Arlington, believes the bill might survive.""The bill may have a chance to pass, but some revenue, of course, would be lost,"" he said. ""The message the bill sends is 'We are a gun state and aim to stay that way.'""Frankly, this bill is as good as the tax holiday for school supplies,"" Saxe said. ""But it could open up a lot of other legislation favoring various interests."""\u000a

V"The Alaska Senate on Tuesday approved a Parnell administration measure to roll back cruise ship wastewater standards that were approved by voters in 2006. The vote was 14-6.The legislation, already passed by the House, is the first bill to clear both the House and Senate in the 2013 legislative session that began just over a month ago.All Senate Republicans voted for the measure, along with Democrat Lyman Hoffman.Democrats Bill Wielechowski, Dennis Egan, Hollis French, Berta Gardner, Johnny Ellis and Donny Olson voted against it.House Bill 80 allows the cruise industry to indefinitely discharge ammonia, a product of human waste, and heavy metals, dissolved from ship plumbing. Such discharges would have been banned starting in 2015 by that voter initiative passed in 2006 and later revised.The legislation also ends the work of an advisory panel on cruise ship wastewater. The panel was created by a 2009 law. Its task was to investigate whether the technology exists to meet the 2006 standards.Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, said the new legislation was the result of years of research, and technology has advanced the level of treatment but no new methods are on even on the horizon to lower levels of copper, zinc, nickel and ammonia at the point effluent is discharged. She said the measure will not lower Alaska's water quality standards.Ammonia can contribute to algae blooms and harm shellfish. Copper, a heavy metal, has been shown to hurt the homing sense of salmon -- their ability to smell -- in freshwater.Large cruise ships no longer discharge raw sewage, Giessel said, and the state Department of Environmental Conservation will still require the industry to use advanced treatment systems that produce cleaner effluent than most municipalities do.""The intent of HB 80 is to apply a consistent environmental approach to all wastewater dischargers in Alaska -- cruise ships, municipalities, fish processors and others,"" she said.The initiative for large cruise ships required them to meet state water quality standards -- meaning the water had to be clean enough not to harm life -- at the point that treated wastewater is discharged from the ship, not after it is diluted in seawater.The bill just passed allows for the standards to be met at the edge of ""mixing zones,"" -- where the effluent starts to dilute in the sea -- not at the point of discharge. Mixing zones for effluent from municipal treatment facilities can be tested, but ships continuously dump wastewater while moving, so the water quality in their mixing zones is based on computer ""modeling,"" not actual sampling.Democrat Olson -- who is from Golovin, near Nome, and this year is aligned with the Republicans -- said he had been deluged with emails of concern from his district and could not support the GOP-backed measure.Alaska's cruise industry isn't just in Southeast anymore, he said.""Their concern is that we've seen more and more cruise ships coming around the Northwest Passage, coming on down the Bering Straits, and the people from Savoonga, the people from St. Lawrence Island are very concerned about what is going on and are watching this bill very closely,"" Olson said.His region already was hit by the end of a state program that gave communities a voice in managing projects and activities along their coasts. The cruise ship wastewater bill is an additional insult, he said.Wielechowski, an Anchorage Democrat, said the cruise ship industry dramatically outspent the initiative backers in 2006, but voters still backed the measure, the result of cruise ships' history of polluting in Alaska and elsewhere.During Tuesday's floor debate, he listed a series of violations, starting with a 1998 case against Holland America for discharging oily bilge water in Alaska waters that resulted in a felony conviction, a $1 million fine and $1 million in restitution. To say that DEC can be trusted in enforcing the highest standards is misleading, he said. Permit requirements vary from ship to ship, based on the equipment aboard that ship, he said.Egan, Juneau's sole senator and part of the GOP majority, said the travel industry is his district's biggest employer -- bigger than fishing, bigger than health care -- yet he opposed the bill because he wants the cruise industry to meet the highest standards.A measure supporter, Sen. Lesil McGuire, R-Anchorage, said voters may have been confused by ballot language in 2006 that indicated the measure was just to make cruise ships meet the same standards as everyone else.In 2009, the Legislature delayed the effective date of the voter-backed requirements until 2015 and created a science panel to determine whether treatment systems existed to meet those standards.The panel issued a draft report in November that said while the technology was available in land-based treatment programs, such ship-board technology did not yet exist. The report said discharges below the water quality standards wouldn't cause environmental damage, though one dissenting member -- the sole independent scientist on the panel -- said the report minimized the potential for harm.Officials with the state Department of Environmental Conversation assured the science panel its preliminary work wouldn't be used to craft legislation, but Gov. Sean Parnell's proposal explicitly cited the panel's work as its basis. Giessel told reporters Tuesday the DEC had told the panel its work would be used in developing legislation.Fishing groups, environmentalists, Alaska Native organizations and residents of coastal communities spoke against the measure.The bill was passed quickly in the House, where lawmakers spent about four hours debating it during hearings, said Democratic House Minority Leader Beth Kerttula.The measure also extends wastewater discharge permits from the current three years to five years.It is effective immediately.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/03/01/5229334/working-in-secret-house-has-its.html,"A bipartisan group of members of the House of Representatives is close to introducing its own immigration bill, which would grant legal status to many of the nations estimated 11 million illegal immigrants but _ in a significant departure from similar proposals in the White House and Senate _ isnt expected to include new paths to citizenship, according to those involved in the discussions. The House proposal likely will stoke the already volatile debate on immigration as many Democrats  including President Barack Obama  immigrants advocates and union leaders have staked their ground on a path to citizenship being essential to any compromise. Under the anticipated House proposal, no one would be barred permanently from citizenship, but theyd be eligible only via pathways that already are available to any other immigrants, including marriage, family or employment-based sponsorships. I will argue until my last breath for a pathway to citizenship that is quick and efficient because I want to end this chapter. I want to end it, said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat whos among the Houses most outspoken advocates for immigrants. The goal, he said, is to have no permanent underclass.But let me say, conversely, I am as committed as any Republican to ending illegal immigration as we know it, he added. They want to end it. So do I. Neither Gutierrez nor any other member of the bipartisan group would confirm his or her involvement in the House team. But those aware of the discussion say hes among a group of four Democrats and four Republicans, some of whom have been meeting secretly for years, who are working to craft a bipartisan immigration plan that they think could pass the more conservative chamber of Congress. Other members include Republicans Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, Raul Labrador of Idaho, John Carter and Sam Johnson, both of Texas, and Democrats John Yarmuth of Kentucky, Xavier Becerra and Zoe Lofgren, both of California.Their proposed legislation, like the White House and Senate proposals, would beef up border security, establish a nationwide system to verify the legal status of workers, punish businesses that hire illegal immigrants and allow more agricultural and highly skilled immigrant workers to stay in the country.Members of the House bipartisan team hope to release the bill within three weeks, possibly before the Senate legislation, which is scheduled to be delivered at the end of the month, according to officials familiar with the teams proposal.Working in secret has been a necessity, considering the high stakes. The Republican-led House is seen as the greatest obstacle to a comprehensive overhaul. Many conservative House members continue to liken a path to citizenship to amnesty, and they find it an affront to the principles of the rule of law. On the other side of the issue, many advocates responded in outrage last month after the Senate bipartisan team introduced its own proposal, which would offer a path to citizenship only after an independent assessment determined that the nations borders were secure. Several immigrant rights groups, including the National Council of La Raza and the National Immigration Law Center, urged Obama to reject that aspect of the Senate proposal, which would more than likely be seen as more sympathetic than the House version. Under the House plan, many immigrants brought to the country as children, agricultural workers and highly skilled immigrants would likely be granted permanent residency. Then presumably they could apply for citizenship within a handful of years, as under the current system. How many years is unclear. Many conservative Republicans also are likely to be dissatisfied with the House proposal. Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa still hasnt gotten over the so-called 1986 amnesty bill signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. It legalized 3 million undocumented immigrants and failed to prevent a wave of millions more from rushing into the country. The promise then was law enforcement in exchange for amnesty, King said Wednesday during a Capital Hill discussion on immigration among conservative Republicans. We have the same dialogue going on now that we had in 2006 and 2007. And Im sitting here a bit astonished that were seriously considering that our president is going to help us enforce immigration law.At the same meeting, Labrador said any new pathway to citizenship was off the table. He told McClatchy afterward that Democrats needed to come to the right a little bit. I think if they continue to insist on it, then it could potentially blow up the entire immigration reform package, he said. The bipartisan House group has been meeting for months behind the scenes to craft principles before working on the details of more specific legislation. The core members started talking in 2009, then essentially went into hibernation a year later as the vitriol over immigration reached its peak. They began meeting again after last falls elections, picking up new members such as Labrador For Diaz-Balart, the work has been a family affair as he followed in the footsteps of his brother, former Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., in pushing the issue in the face of strong Republican Party opposition.Im absolutely sure that we have the ability and the willingness to get this done, he said this week. The House leadership has issued its support for getting an agreement. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has applauded the work of House members and said Congress must deal with immigration this year.House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said last week that he hoped Congress could follow labor and business  which has agreed on a set of principals for immigrant workers  in putting politics aside to find common ground on the immigration front. Lets hope we can follow that lead in the months ahead, he said in a statement."\u000a

It practically takes a flatbed truck of meat, poultry, breads and other goods to sustain 6-foot-10 Eric Stuteville and 6-9 Mason Stuteville, who is closing fast. The brothers don't snack; they feed. And the more they take in, the more energy they have as basketball players and honors students for Casa Roble High School in Orangevale.""We tell her all the time, 'We're running out of food, Mom!' "" said Eric, a senior, with his brother, a junior, nodding in agreement.""I usually buy four or five gallons of milk a week,"" Davenport said, ""and I don't buy eggs by the dozen anymore. I get them by the flat  60 or so.""In hightops, the brothers have an equally ravenous appetite.Eric, headed to Sacramento State on scholarship, is averaging 21.7 points and 12.3 rebounds for the Rams, who play Sierra of Manteca tonight at Cosumnes River College in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division III semifinal. Mason, with an expanding national recruiting profile to match his soaring frame, averages 17.3 points and 11.7 rebounds.The brothers usually don't go up against each other, at least not in the team's practices, for fear of a wayward elbow to the face. Both are defensive tyrants, clogging the lane, blocking shots and altering others. They're also skilled big men who can score on post moves, jumpers and runners.""We realized that you have to have a skill set, no matter how big you are,"" Eric said.Added Mason: ""It's really important to be a complete player. You have to have an outside shot to go with the inside game, and you have to be able to handle the ball.""The brothers grew up with basketball.Mom muscled in for rebounds at Cal in the late 1970s. Father Shannon played in Mississippi. Kris' brother, Andy Franklin, was a 6-8 post player for Shasta High in the early 1980s who also played at Pacific.Eric was 9.6 pounds and 22 inches long at birth. Mason, a year younger and a month premature, was 8.6 pounds and 20 inches.""If he aged a bit,"" Kris said, a groan in her voice, ""he would've been every bit as big as his brother.""And the growth continues. Every few months, it's time to look for new pants and bigger shoes.And the competition never seems to end.""We play until we start arguing,"" Mason said with a laugh. ""We've been hard on each other but good for each other.""Said Kris: ""Oh, they're brutal. If they do go against each other in practice, or they go out and play, someone's coming home with a bruise or cut or laceration, a split lip. It's a never-ending battle to see who is the better player. One day, it's one brother, then the next, it's the other.""The brothers also have grown up in an academic environment. Kris, who earned advanced degrees at Sac State, is a physical therapist.That field intrigues both brothers, with Mason explaining, ""It's studying the body, how it works, what muscles and bones do what.""Eric is equally interested in the field.""(Eric will) call me and say, 'Hey coach, did you know there are like 30,000 blood vessels within a square inch of skin?' "" said Sac State coach Brian Katz. ""As a player, he's special.

V"The Capital Christian football team has a special gift for a Modesto reporter.It's a T-shirt signed by all the players, their way of thanking the Modesto Bee's Rich Estrada for providing extra postseason motivation.""He basically said before we played Modesto Christian that we didn't belong in the playoffs,"" Cougars coach Phil Grams said. ""We made sure to put his articles on our bulletin board.""Capital Christian defeated Modesto Christian 41-0 in Friday's Sac-Joaquin Section Division IV opener, improving the fourth-seeded Cougars to 10-1.""I was hoping we'd win seven ballgames and get a playoff game,"" said Grams, a second-year coach who replaced the popular spread with the physical fly offense he brought from Granite Bay, where he was a longtime assistant to good friend Ernie Cooper.""I think the biggest thing is that our seniors really bought into our offseason program,"" Grams said. ""They got bigger, stronger and faster. Now we like playing physical football.""Other than a 31-12 loss to Amador, no team was closer than two touchdowns to the Cougars during the regular season. Capital Christian coasted to the Golden Empire League championship and could create some additional buzz with a win Friday at home over No. 5 Los Banos (10-1).What the Cougars lack in numbers  they're up to 27 players after adding three from the junior varsity and two kickers from the section championship soccer team  they make up for in talent.Senior Quinton Kirk has rushed for 1,569 yards and 25 touchdowns and averages more than 10 tackles on defense at linebacker. Sophomore Justice Shelton-Mosley has nearly 2,000 all-purpose yards, 22 touchdowns and six interceptions as a free safety.Grams, who coached flybacks Devon Wylie (Kansas City Chiefs) and Peyton Thompson (Atlanta Falcons) at Granite Bay, calls Shelton-Mosley the best he has coached at the position.Capital Christian also has large-school talent on its line.Junior Nifae Lealao, a 6-foot-4, 270-pounder, is a national recruit with offers from Oregon, USC and Stanford. Joining Lealao on the line are seniors Brandon Roznos (6-0, 251) and Andrew Peterson (6-3, 220), junior Matt Richards (6-2, 245) and sophomore Trey Belton (6-5, 220).Capital Christian is the second-smallest school (377 students) in the Division IV field, in which Placer (11-0) and Central Catholic of Modesto (9-2) are huge favorites.""Los Banos is really good, and they've got 45 guys on their roster,"" Grams said. ""If we can stay healthy, win the battle of attrition, and come out with a win, heck, yeah, we've got a shot"" at the section title.Another dynamic duo  Capital Christian's Kirk and Shelton-Mosley aren't the only imposing one-two offensive punch leading a surprise team in Division IV.No. 10 Center (9-2), which plays Friday at No. 2 Argonaut (11-0), is led by senior running back D'Juan Bellaire (1,941 rushing yards and 28 total touchdowns) and junior quarterback Tyrel Anderson (1,272 passing yards and 13 touchdowns; 782 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns).Maturation process  Two reasons Antelope (10-1) won its first playoff game in program history and will host No. 5 Buhach Colony (9-2) of Atwater in a Division II game Friday: The Titans' all-senior offensive line, called ""The Force"" (Daren Echeveria, Leonard Hazewood, Nathan Rhodes, Christian Pinedo and Tyler Moore), and junior quarterback Tyler McCombs, who has passed for 1,736 yards and 20 touchdowns.""He's intelligent, has a strong arm, and he's got a swagger about him,"" said coach Matt Ray, a former high school and college quarterback."\u000a

V"Much has been made of Sacramento High's talented freshman boys class that is helping the No. 5 Dragons varsity excel this season.But the top-ranked Dragons girls team has some ninth-grade bragging rights, too.Guards Aliceah Hernandez, Alana Myers and Andrea Butler have helped the Dragons to extend their league winning streak to 83 games entering tonight's Metro Conference home game against No. 5 McClatchy.""I can't say enough about our freshmen,"" Sac High coach Michele Massari said. ""They've been poised, and they make an impact.""They were busy again Thursday as the Dragons beat No. 3 Kennedy 53-49 in a Metro showdown and battle of defending Sac-Joaquin Section champions in Greenhaven.The 5-foot-6 Hernandez, a starter, had seven points, including two game-clinching free throws with 7.7 seconds to play. The 5-6 Myers hit a three-pointer midway through the third quarter that put Sacramento ahead to stay, 32-30, after the Cougars had rallied to take the lead.""Alana is a lefty and a beyond-her-years player,"" Massari said. ""Aliceah brings toughness and swag. Both know the game really well.""The duo accounted for more than half of Sacramento's points in a 41-40 win over Kincaid of Houston in the West Coast Jamboree in Antioch on Dec. 27.While the 5-3 Butler is less of a scoring threat, she offers savvy and pinpoint passing as a backup point guard to Zonyia Cormier.The freshmen have helped fill the vacuum left by the loss of Cal State Fullerton signee Casey Williams, a senior out for the season after shoulder surgery.They also have bonded well with Sacramento's core veterans: seniors Allie Green and Breanna Garrett and juniors Cormier, Chaya Durr and imposing 6-4 post Ayanna Edwards.Troubadours up and down  No. 9 St. Francis seems to take its fans on a roller-coaster ride every game.The Troubadours fell 58-54 in overtime Jan. 15 at No. 2 Oak Ridge in a Delta River League game, then routed No. 10 Pleasant Grove 57-37 in league play Friday behind Susie Rogers' 18 points.St. Francis then fell 47-43 to No. 8 Del Oro on Saturday and beat No. 11 Florin 63-57 at Monday's Martin Luther King showcase at St. Mary's in Stockton. Najah Queenland led the Troubadours with 21 points.St. Francis plays at Folsom on Friday, then Saturday hosts Sacred Heart Cathedral of San Francisco, a 56-51 winner Saturday over league rival Archbishop Mitty of San Jose, the defending CIF D-II state champion.Showdown in Loomis  Last season, No. 4 Nevada Union ended Del Oro's 63-game Sierra Foothill League winning streak with a 44-42 win in Loomis.So the Miners' goal this season, entering tonight's game at Del Oro, is to end the Golden Eagles' seven-year reign as league champions.Nevada Union, riding a 12-game winning steak, continues to show consistent balance. Junior Sydney Porter is the team's only double-figure scorer at 12.2 points per game.Other key contributors are seniors Nicole Lierly and Kaylin Martin, juniors Emma Peterson, Erin Selleck and Melanie O'Brien and sophomore Sammy DeHart."\u000a

V"There was only one fitting way for Tina Maze to wrap up the overall World Cup title - with another victory, and with plenty of time to spare.She clinched her first crystal globe Sunday by winning a super-combined for eighth win of the season. So overpowering was her season that she clinched the overall trophy with nine races to go.""It's really special because it's so difficult to win. For me, it's special to continue this level of skiing,"" said Maze, who celebrated with a cartwheel. ""To be on the top is amazing. It's a great season for me. Even if there have been ups and downs I have always come back.""To Maze, it was also the perfect response to doubters back home in Slovenia. Some mocked her for having the audacity to dream about becoming the world's best skier.""I think the people are realizing that the dream came true, that one year ago they were saying 'Ah, this Maze, she's making jokes when she says she will win a globe or something like that. Yeah, she's full of herself' and these kinds of things,"" Maze said. ""In Slovenia, it's (the) mentality. It's better to be sometimes (more mainstream) than to go out (and be different) from the majority.""I didn't want to be like everybody else. So I'm always looking for something else, something better, something different and I'm really proud of that.""Maze led the downhill and coasted home in the slalom after Maria Hoefl-Riesch crashed out of contention. She tied a season record with her 18th top-three finish, matching the podium mark set by Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden and Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein.""I'm an emotional person, I didn't want to cry (on the podium),"" Maze said, adding she felt sick before the slalom. ""I went to the toilet six times before I started. A lot of people (were) sick and I guess I get something from them, too.""Maze has 1,844 points in the overall standings and looks all but certain to break the season record -men or women - of 2,000 held by Austrian great Hermann Maier.Hoefl-Riesch is second in the overall standings but is 958 points behind and has no chance of closing the gap. Each victory is worth 100 points.Lindsey Vonn, the four-time overall winner and defending champion, fell out of contention after she took a monthlong break because of an intestinal illness and then was done for the season after a knee injury at the world championships. Vonn is still third overall with 740 points.""I'm really tired now, especially after a long day like today,"" the 29-year-old Maze said. ""Today was so tough, I didn't know where I was. I almost went off the course twice. But I just managed to catch the gates. It's crazy.""She is also seeking to become only the third woman to have at least one win in all five disciplines in one season, and lacks only a downhill victory. She had a chance Saturday but finished fourth. She has two downhills remaining, starting next week in the German resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen.Vonn won 12 races last season and Maze has a chance of matching that, although Swiss great Vreni Schneider's single-season World Cup record of 14 wins appears out of sight.Nicole Hosp of Austria, the world championship bronze medalist in the super-combi, finished second. Countrywoman Michaela Kirchgasser took third place with a superb slalom run - 42.66 seconds to Maze's 44.26.""My target is to be focused until the end of the season because there are many small globes that are open and possible to get,"" Maze said. ""I want to keep this level of skiing until the end, I don't want to go down, I want to keep it at the high level.""Hosp, the World Cup winner in 2007, lauded Maze's consistency.""There are no words to describe Tina's amazing season,"" Hosp said.Julia Mancuso came close to clinching the fourth super-combi podium of her career and her first in six years. But the American made a small mistake midway through, falling forward on her skis.It seems only an injury can prevent Maze from breaking Maier's points record, set in 1999-2000. Vonn holds the women's record with 1,980 points from last season.""It has been an extraordinary season for Tina,"" Kirchgasser said. ""To be so far ahead in the points. Last time it was a man who won with more than 2,000 points, and I don't think Tina will be far off.""Maze's phenomenal season also includes three gold medals from the worlds in Schladming, Austria - gold in super-G and silver in super-combi and giant slalom. She lost out on a second gold to Hoefl-Riesch and felt Sunday's win somewhat made up for that.""I had that in mind because in Schladming I didn't do a good slalom,"" she said. ""I didn't risk a lot and today I did different, so at the end it's a revenge, too, but the priority was better skiing from my side.""It's a good slope. I had some troubles yesterday in downhill,"" Maze said. ""I had some trouble on the top. But the rest of the hill is like a dream."""\u000a

Milwaukee's Ersan Ilyasova (159 points) finished second, and Minnesota's Nikola Pekovic (104) was third. Kings center DeMarcus Cousins finished 15th with 11 points.A first-time starter this season, Anderson averaged 16.1 points and 7.7 rebounds after averaging 8.6 points in his first three seasons. The 6-foot-10 forward led the NBA in three-pointers attempted (422) and made (166). The only other power forward in history to lead the league in three-pointers made was Rashard Lewis, also for Orlando, in 2008-09.""Ryan never ceases to amaze me,"" said Oak Ridge basketball coach Steve Scott, whose star led the Trojans to a state championship in 2005 and was named The Bee's Player of the Decade in 2010. ""He keeps getting better, working harder  at every level.""It's also his personality. He's very humble. He came by an Oak Ridge practice during this past Thanksgiving, and it was like he was still in high school. He was great with the kids. None of this has gone to his head.

Armstead and Anderson remain close, talking by phone or texting regularly, including earlier this week.""Ryan had no clue this was coming,"" Armstead said. ""He's still the same guy (with) the same work ethic, the same drive to be successful. I'm so proud and excited for him.

V"REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY BY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL LANNY A. BREUER AT THE BP PRESS CONFERENCE NEW ORLEANS Thank you, Attorney General Holder. In April 2010, the nation witnessed an unimaginable tragedy, when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven people onboard the rig died, and oil began pouring out of the Macondo well, and onto the sea floor, for months, causing immense damage to the Gulf region and to our ecosystem. The communities here in New Orleans, and around the Gulf, have waited patiently for justice to be done. Today, their wait is over. The Deepwater Horizon Task Force filed a 14-count information and guilty plea agreement, in New Orleans federal court earlier today. The information charges BP Exploration and Production Inc. with 11 counts of felony manslaughter; violations of environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act and Migratory Bird Act; and obstruction of Congress. BP has agreed to plead guilty to each of these 14 counts and to pay the highest criminal fine in U.S. history. Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that the deaths of the 11 men onboard the Deepwater Horizon could have been avoided. The explosion of the rig was a disaster that resulted from BPs culture of privileging profit over prudence; and we allege that BPs most senior decisionmakers onboard the Deepwater Horizon negligently caused the explosion. We hope that todays acknowledgement by BP of its misconduct  through its agreement to plead guilty to 11 counts of felony manslaughter  brings some measure of justice to the family members of the people who died onboard the rig. As the oil spill continued, BP made a tragic situation worse: it began misleading Congress and the American people about how much oil was pouring out of the Macondo well. As BP now admits, in responding to Congress, the company lied and withheld documents, in order to make it seem as though less damage was being done to the environment than was actually occurring. Acknowledging those lies, BP has agreed to plead guilty to felony obstruction of Congress. Make no mistake: While the company is guilty, individuals committed these crimes. And we have also unsealed today a 23-count indictment charging BPs two highest-ranking supervisors onboard the Deepwater Horizon with manslaughter and violation of the Clean Water Act. The indictment charges these two BP well site leaders with negligence, and gross-negligence, on the evening of April 20, 2010. In the face of glaring red flags indicating that the well was not secure, both men allegedly failed to take appropriate action to prevent the blowout. A separate indictment was also unsealed today charging a former senior BP executive, David Rainey, with obstructing a congressional investigation and making false statements to law enforcement officials. The indictment alleges that Rainey, on behalf of BP, intentionally underestimated the amount of oil flowing from the Macondo well. Rainey allegedly cherry-picked pages from documents, withheld other documents altogether and lied to Congress and others in order to make the spill appear less catastrophic than it was. The Attorney General stood near here when the Department first opened its criminal investigation into the oil spill and promised that we would thoroughly investigate and hold to account those responsible for this horrible tragedy. Today, we have begun doing exactly that; and tomorrow, and in the months to come, the Deepwater Horizon Task Force will continue its tireless pursuit of justice in this matter. I would like to personally thank Task Force Director John Buretta, who has done an absolutely remarkable job leading this investigation, as well as the many fine prosecutors from the Criminal Division, Environment and Natural Resources Division and U.S. Attorney community, and the many talented federal and state law enforcement agents, who have worked so hard, for so long, to develop these cases. I would also like to thank our colleagues at the Securities and Exchange Commission for their important parallel investigation. Thank you. # # #"\u000a

V"It's a second-tier soccer league, and the team will play its home games at a community college.But Sacramento officials believe the city's newest professional sports team  an expansion franchise in the USL Pro soccer league  could eventually lead to the big time.The city was awarded a USL Pro franchise Monday, with the team's expected debut in spring 2014. It will be the 14th team in the league, whose teams range from the Los Angeles Blues in Orange County to the Wilmington Hammerheads in North Carolina.Sacramento's still-unnamed team, with an ownership group led by former River Cats executive Warren Smith, is negotiating to play its home games at recently refurbished Hughes Stadium at Sacramento City College.Smith, joined by Mayor Kevin Johnson and other officials, said the USL Pro entry could be a means to an end: a franchise in Major League Soccer, the sport's top tier in the United States.Four of the last five MLS expansion teams were franchises in the USL Pro league.""This is a proving ground,"" said Tim Holt, president of USL Pro.The announcement, at a crowded news conference at Hot Italian restaurant in midtown, was part of a busy soccer day in greater Sacramento.Elk Grove, which has been pursuing an MLS franchise on its own for the past year, revealed that Mayor-elect Gary Davis met over the weekend with that league's commissioner, Don Garber. Davis said the meeting, at the MLS championship game in Los Angeles, was at Garber's invitation.""The conversation was positive,"" Davis said. ""I don't want to overstate the commitment, but there's an interest in bringing a team to our region.""MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche said the league is mainly focused on adding a second team in New York. But Sacramento is among a handful of cities on the league's radar for future expansion, along with Orlando, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Miami.""We know that Sacramento is a vibrant soccer market,"" he said. The MLS has 19 teams.He added that the new USL Pro franchise in Sacramento could enhance the region's chances down the road.Similarly, Davis and Smith both said they don't believe the Sacramento team will hurt Elk Grove's efforts, or vice versa. Smith said the important thing is securing an MLS franchise some day for greater Sacramento.""I don't care if it's in Elk Grove, the city of Sacramento, West Sacramento, Roseville,"" he said.Smith, who was instrumental in bringing the River Cats to Sacramento, said he helped run the USL Pro franchise in Portland from 2006 to 2008. That team, the Timbers, graduated to the MLS last season.""I know the business,"" Smith said.He said the new Sacramento franchise represents a multimillion-dollar investment, though he wouldn't go into details about financing. He plans to run a name-the-team contest, the way the River Cats did when they relocated from Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2000.Going from USL Pro to the MLS would be a substantial financial leap. The entry fee for expansion teams in USL Pro is under $1 million, Holt said. It's $40 million for the MLS.And while Hughes Stadium is fine for the USL Pro circuit, the MLS is known to favor cities that build made-for-soccer facilities in the $100 million range.Still, a pro soccer team at any level would provide a boost for the region's sports fans, who continue to worry about the Sacramento Kings' long-term future.""This is a big deal for our community,"" Johnson said.The mayor, who led the unsuccessful push for a new downtown arena for the Kings, said it was premature to say whether an MLS stadium could be financed in the same way as the basketball project: by leveraging the city's parking operations.But City Councilman Steve Cohn said ""the parking model, if the (stadium) were downtown, could make sense.""For now, 84-year-old Hughes Stadium will have to do. The 21,000-seat stadium recently underwent a $13 million makeover that included new turf and renovated bleachers, restrooms, food-service facilities and locker rooms.""It's a pretty good face-lift,"" said Mitch Campbell, the college's athletic director.While the soccer team wouldn't start play until 2014, Smith said his organization wants to stage a series of exhibition games in Sacramento next year.USL Pro, founded in 1993, is based in Tampa and includes franchises in suburban Los Angeles, Charlotte, N.C., and Phoenix as well as smaller markets like Harrisburg, Pa., and Dayton, Ohio. One of its teams plays in Antigua, in the West Indies. The teams play a 13-game home schedule, but also play occasional preseason games against MLS squads.USL Pro is the top rung of United Soccer Leagues, which operates multiple men's and women's teams throughout North America."\u000a

V"California Musical Theatre has turned out the lights and dropped the curtain on the Cosmopolitan Cabaret.CMT will no longer operate the 200-seat theater at the corner of 10th and K Streets, which it opened in 2008. Last week CMT executive producer Richard Lewis asked his board of directors to sign off on an agreement terminating their lease with developer David Taylor, who owns the building. The state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems will not go unused for long, however, as restaurateur Randy Paragary will take over operation of the theater space to create a nightclub he plans to call The Assembly. He will open the new club March 1 and intends to have acts booked every night.""I'm going in there because I'm joined at the hip with the space,"" Paragary said. ""It was always an integral part of the business plan because a significant part of our dinner business came from people going to the show. So that space was very important to us.""The Cabaret has shared the ground floor of the Cosmopolitan building with Cafe Bernardo on K (formerly the Cosmo Cafe) and the KBar, all operated by the Paragary Restaurant Group. The nightclub Social occupies the building's second floor.Paragary plans to adapt and slightly renovate the Cabaret space to be a part of the young, active nightlife hub on the block, which already includes KBar, Dive Bar, Pizza Rock and Social.""What we intend to do fits the demographic of what is happening down there,"" Paragary said.He will add a bar to the performance space and booths on the first level of raised seating. He said he'll work with local promoters to book a broad variety of entertainers into the facility. He also has an agreement with B Street Theatre to bring in its sketch comedy troupe four nights a week. The cabaret has been dark since the Nov. 18 closing of ""I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change,"" and the company's last show in the facility will be a CMT fundraiser at 7:30 p.m. today with Broadway vocalist Eric Kunze. The Cosmo Cabaret opened in September 2008, a $15 million joint effort of developer David Taylor and real estate investors CIM Group; along with Randy Paragary and CMT. ""Richard Lewis deserves a lot of credit for getting this space built, because our community needs this type and size of venue,"" Paragary said. Lewis formulated a plan for the space in 2006, suggesting the theater to city officials who were desperate for ideas to develop the then-abandoned former Woolworth's store. CMT operates the 2,200- seat Wells Fargo Pavilion for its summer Music Circus season and presents national touring companies in the 2,422-seat Community Center Theater through its Broadway Sacramento Series, but thought it might also work with a smaller space.Lewis had seen other musical theater companies successfully operate smaller spaces. Smaller productions typically had longer runs, often a year or more, which made them attractive financially. ""What we hoped to do was repeat the success, in particular of Denver, where you pick a show like 'I Love, You're Perfect' or 'Forever Plaid' and it runs for three or four years,"" Lewis said.The Cosmo Cabaret audience averaged about 50 percent capacity, significantly less than CMT needed for the venture to succeed.At the beginning, Lewis said, his hope was ""65 percent to really make it, with the upside being we should be able to get to 80 percent."" Things didn't worked out in Sacramento for a number of reasons, insiders said.""What Richard and I didn't see coming, of course, was the recession and how it hit the state and our businesses,"" Paragary said.In addition, an evolution of the area and the businesses was taking place up and down the block. CMT marketed its shows like ""Forever Plaid"" and ""Late Nite Catechism"" to its older Music Circus and Broadway Sacramento subscriber base, for whom downtown K Street at night seemed a world apart. ""The simplest thing to say, I guess, is it turned out that the Cabaret was a bridge too far for California Musical Theatre, all things considered,"" Lewis said. Yet the night life in the area has drawn a much younger crowd, and that's what Paragary will tailor the new venue to fit.""It's going to be a place where people can have fun at a bar with live music. There are lot of acts out there who can't play a Memorial Auditorium-size venue, but they want to play somewhere,"" Paragary said. ""I'm pretty jacked-up about it, really.""Paragary is still filling out the entertainment so that the space can be open every night of the week. ""I think it's going to be a terrific option for Sacramento as far as a venue,"" Paragary said."\u000a

V"The politically charged issue of race was before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case that could determine how the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act applies to the South.The nine justices engaged in a lively and at times contentious 70-minute exchange, with several possibly signaling their positions in what may mean a new chapter in the nations divided racial history. The repercussions of their eventual decision could be felt throughout the country.Is it the governments submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North? Chief Justice John Roberts asked in an apparently facetious question that drew gasps from the audience. The case arose out of Shelby County, Ala., which is challenging sections of the pivotal 1965 law that prohibited discriminatory voting rules. The county brought the suit against the sections of the law that require nine mostly Southern states and portions of seven others to receive prior approval from the U.S. Department of Justice on voting procedures or anything that affects a minority groups ability to cast ballots.The nine states currently covered in their entirety under the contested sections are Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, Alaska, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia. The seven others are California, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York and South Dakota. Several of the states are engaged in legal disputes with the Justice Department on Voting Rights Act clearance issues, such as Texas ongoing fight over drawing district lines.The hearing drew well-known African-American leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and several African-American members of Congress. Among them was the House Democrats assistant leader, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina.The courts ideological lines were immediately obvious as Justice Sonia Sotomayor challenged Shelby Countys attorney, Bert Rein.Some portions of the South have changed, said Sotomayor, who then cited an ongoing pattern of discriminatory voting procedures in Shelby County. Your county pretty much hasnt. You may be the wrong party in bringing this.Rein argued that applying Section 5 of the law to only certain states violates the Constitution, which is based on laws being applied equally. He said that the formula to determine which jurisdictions fall under Section 5 is outdated, based on long-since discontinued literacy tests and voting registration dependent on mid-1960s data.At the center of the case is whether the courts or Congress, which in 2006 reauthorized the Voting Rights Act for 25 years, should decide whether the prior approval requirement in Section 5  considered by supporters to be a deterrent to discrimination  stays in place.U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli pointed out that Congress had looked at the record and approved the law by large margins. But Justice Antonin Scalia said, I think it is attributable to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement. Scalia said that he did not think Congress would ever change the law, but the courts should. Even the name of it is wonderful: the Voting Rights Act, he said, emphasizing that politicians had no incentive to alter it. Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?Justice Elena Kagan said that deciding which states were engaged in discriminatory voting activities would be a new power for the judges.I dont think this falls under our bailiwick, she said.But the issue of applying the law equally to the states and jurisdictions seemed to resonate with several justices.Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group, said that Congress should have updated the 1960s voting statistics used as a basis in the formula for Section 5 compliance.At least five members of the court seemed to agree that it is constitutionally impermissible, in the words of Justice Anthony Kennedy, to treat some states as independent sovereign(s) and others as under the trusteeship of the United States government without actual, current evidence in a distinction between these states.Kennedy is seen as the swing vote in many closely divided cases.But feelings also ran strong among African-Americans.About 15 members of the 42-member Congressional Black Caucus held a rally in front of the Supreme Court building before the arguments to urge the court to keep the Voting Rights Act intact.We still have blatant and subtle impediments to voters, said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which was part of the case against Shelby County.She cited last-minute polling place changes to locations outside the community, elimination of early voting days and the outright canceling of elections as obstacles faced by minorities.The tension over the Voting Rights Act came together for Clyburn, who, after attending the court hearing about the Alabama case, crossed the street to the U.S. Capitol to speak at the presentation of a statue honoring Alabama native Rosa Parks. By refusing to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery bus in 1955, she is credited with launching the civil rights movement. One hour ago, I sat across the street witnessing the opening arguments of a voting rights case before the United States Supreme Court, a case that many feel could turn the clock back on much of the progress that has been made, and for which we pause today to honor Rosa Parks, he said."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2011/10/21/3997834/following-complaints-from-gulf.html,"WASHINGTON  Republican Sens. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Marco Rubio of Florida, unhappy with the handling of the $20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate victims of the 2010 Gulf oil spill, won Senate approval Friday for an independent audit of the organization. The move amounts to a slap at Kenneth Feinberg, the administrator of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, who has been criticized for the lack of transparency in the distribution of funds and the way the calculations of the payments are made. Feinberg became a national figure and earned kudos for his administration of the 9/11 victims' fund. But the BP fund has been a much stickier proposition. The Republican action came as an amendment to an appropriations bill, which is likely to pass and be enacted into law. The House of Representatives has passed a similar amendment. Mississippians who submitted claims to the GCCF deserve to know how their claims payments were determined, said Wicker. This amendment will bring needed transparency to the claims process, and I am glad to have worked with Senator Rubio and other Gulf Coast members to help advance it. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, also supports the effort. Sen. Cochran has consistently supported efficiency and transparency in the BP claims process, said Chris Gallegos, Cochran's spokesman. This amendment is another means of assuring claimants of that. Feinberg said in a statement: I have said all along, we welcome an independent audit and have been working with the Department of Justice. The amendment orders the Justice Department to find an independent auditor. According to Feinberg spokeswoman Amy Weiss, about $5.4 billion of the $20 billion fund has been dispersed. Congress has ratcheted up its criticism of Feinberg and his management of the fund, and the House Natural Resources Committee has called him to testify Thursday at an oversight hearing. The Wicker and Rubio amendment is attached to an appropriations bill, which is expected to be approved when the Senate returns in a week. The House amendment, sponsored by Rep. Jo Bonner, R-Ala., was approved in July. A Department of Justice audit of the GCCF is overdue, said Rep. Steven Palazzo, R-Miss. Gulf Coast residents need certainty about the fairness and transparency of the claims process. I will be closely monitoring Mr. Feinberg's hearing in front of the Natural Resources Committee next Thursday. The Deepwater Horizon platform operated by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, killing 11 people. The oil spill gushed for nearly three months, and the approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil caused extensive economic and ecological damage to the Gulf Coast.

""We're scrambling for jobs.  In a large campus, it's incredibly hard for students to get plugged in"" to career opportunities.""We're trying to get students plugged into these doors,"" Bue said. ""We're trying to urge Aggies to hire alumni. We want to employ Davis students.""Today, about 8,000 students are employed on campus during the academic year, said Rebecca Sterling, outgoing student body president. The initiative hopes to improve on those numbers. There are also plans to develop a website to track future student hiring and an annual event to update the campus community on the progress made.A career fair at UC Davis' Freeborn Hall on Tuesday was a first step. Alumni business owners, campus internship counselors and career advisers met students one-on-one to dispense advice, share leads and offer encouragement.""I think it's a great opportunity for students to get a first taste of the real world,"" said Bill Hollingshead, a Davis talent agent and UC Davis graduate, class of 1960, between chats with students.

V"Alexis Pinturault of France used a daring second run to win a World Cup giant slalom Sunday as his closest German challengers faltered.Pinturault was second after the first heat, behind hometown favorite Felix Neureuther and ahead of Fritz Dopfer. But Dopfer crashed out in the second run and Neureuther made a mistake that dropped him down in the standings. Germany was seeking its first men's giant slalom victory in 40 years.World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher of Austria and world champion Ted Ligety of the United States profited from the Germans' mistakes to take second and third, respectively.Pinturault clocked a combined time of 2 minutes, 32.42 seconds for his second win of the season and his first giant slalom victory.""I have good memories from Garmisch, I also won the junior giant slalom title here in 2009,"" said Pinturault, who now has three career World Cup victories.Hirscher overcame a stomach virus to extend his overall World Cup lead. He was 0.60 seconds behind the winner and Ligety was 0.63 back.Ligety, the GS specialist who also won two other gold medals at the worlds in Schladming, Austria that concluded a week ago, was fifth after an error-filled first run. The American also made a mistake in the second heat, losing his line at the same spot where Neureuther nearly went off the course.Ligety had won four of the previous five giant slaloms this season and would have set a record with a fifth victory. He has two third-place finishes and leads the giant slalom standings by 105 points over Hirscher. A win is worth 100 points and there are two races remaining.""Third place is not what you want to be getting at this stage, but I'll take it,"" Ligety said. ""In the first run I just made a ton of little mistakes. In the second I was lucky not to get into too much soft snow in that turn. You have to take risks.""Hirscher, who was silver medalist at the worlds behind Ligety, now has a 209-point lead overall over Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, who finished sixth.""It's looking good now,"" said Hirscher, the defending overall champion. ""I think I earned big points today.

V"Two Placer County schools on Monday mourned the loss of a pair of teenage girls who died in an SUV rollover crash on Sunday near Auburn.While there are questions about whether the 17-year-old male driver was traveling faster than the legal limit, there is no question about whether the other four teenagers should have been in the sport-utility vehicle, said CHP spokesman David Martinez.""You have a minor with a provisional license,"" Martinez said. ""This kid should not have had passengers."" He said the department hasn't decided whether to recommend prosecution of the driver.The two girls fatally injured were identified as Morgan Helman, a 17-year-old Del Oro High School student, and Vivian Connor, 13, of Newcastle. The driver and other passengers  who suffered minor injuries  were not identified. One was taken to a hospital and the other two, including the driver, were released to their parents.Neither of the fatally injured girls was wearing a seat belt, Martinez said. They were riding in the back seat, and there weren't enough seat belts for all the passengers, he said.The accident occurred around 7:30 p.m. Sunday as the white Chevy Tahoe traveled southbound on Auburn-Folsom Road just north of Less Lane. Early reports had the vehicle traveling at least 45 mph on the twisty road. According to Martinez, the driver made an unsafe turning movement, lost control and struck a guardrail. The SUV then went over the guardrail and hit a fence before overturning onto its right side. The two girls were partially ejected and suffered fatal injuries.Under California's provisional licensing law, it was illegal for the 17-year-old driver to be transporting any passengers under age 20. The law, a part of the state's Graduated Licensing Program, has been in place since 1998. It is based on national studies showing that first-year drivers are more likely to be involved in serious and fatal crashes if another teenager is in the vehicle. Studies showed that the more teenagers in a car, the more dangerous the driving situation.""It's a huge distraction,"" said Jessica Gonzalez of the state Department of Motor Vehicles. ""As a new driver, there is so much to pay attention to on the road  laws to learn  that having others in the car who could distract you is just dangerous.""Del Oro High School senior Cecelia Campbell said it was a solemn day on campus as students absorbed the news.""It kind of just proves why they have that rule in place,"" said Campbell, the senior class president. State and national studies have shown that provisional licensing programs, including prohibiting first-year teenage drivers from being on the road between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., reduce crashes.But the law is only minimally enforced in California and other states. Under state statutes, law enforcement officers are not allowed to pull over a car with teenagers in it ""for the sole purpose of determining whether the driver"" is in violation of the provisional licensing law. Officers must have some other reason for making the stop.In 2011, about 4,900 teens were convicted for violations of the nighttime and passenger restriction components of the California law, far fewer than the believed number of teens who violate the law.As a result, state safety officials say the policing duties are largely up to parents and the teenagers themselves  but that situation has led to a high level of non-compliance, officials said. A state DMV study in 2003 found that only 52 percent of first-year teen drivers under age 18 complied with the law.""We find it very important that parents be involved,"" the DMV's Gonzalez said, to help ""make sure their son or daughter is becoming a safe driver.""Safety officials said the crash is also a reminder of the importance of seat-belt use. Ironically, new data show that more teenage drivers and passengers than ever in California wore seat belts in 2012. Seat-belt use among teens has now reached 95 percent.With many details of the accident still unclear, Kathleen Daugherty, principal/superintendent of the tiny Newcastle School District, said the focus of teachers and students Monday was on the bright, beautiful girl they lost. Connor was an eighth-grader at Newcastle Elementary, which she had attended since kindergarten. She had recently returned from a school outing to see the presidential inauguration in Washington, D.C. ""She was a delight,"" Daugherty said. ""She was just very easy to be around.""Both Placer County schools brought in Sheriff's Department grief counselors and other volunteers to help students process the news.""This is a very sad time for us,"" Daugherty said. ""We are all mourning her loss. We are a tight little community, and this is very sad for all of us."" Helman grew up in Carmichael, but quickly made an impression at her new school when she arrived about a year ago. She was active in the anti-bullying club.""It's a really big loss for the school,"" said class president Campbell.Helman was also active in Bayside Church's youth program, where teaching pastor Curt Harlow called her a gregarious person that brought people together.""Morgan just had a way of making people feel connected,"" Harlow said."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/22/5208903/no-plans-to-remove-cuba-from-terror.html,"A newspaper report that top State Department officials believe Cuba should be removed from the U.S. list of countries that support terrorism drew denials Thursday from the department and the White House.The Boston Globe had reported that high-level U.S. diplomats have concluded Cuba should be taken off the terror list, which would allow Secretary of State John Kerry to remove a major obstacle to restoring relations with the island. Interviews with top administration officials and members of Congress indicate there is a growing consensus in policy and intelligence circles that Cubas support for terrorist groups has been terminated, the Globe added.The report also noted that Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who has long favored improving relations with Havana, met in recent days with officials to review the Cuba policy.But the report carefully added that U.S officials emphasized that there has not been a formal assessment concluding that Cuba should be removed from the terrorism list.On Thursday, State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland responded: I saw that report. Let me say firmly here it is incorrect. This department has no current plans to remove Cuba from the state sponsor of terrorism list.We review this every year, and at the current moment we  when the last review was done in 2012  didnt see cause to remove them. Well obviously look at it again this year, but as I said, we dont have any plans at the moment, she added.White House spokesman Jay Carney said, We have no changes in our approach or policy to Cuba to announce or under consideration that Im aware of.Policy makers in Washington are not currently discussing Cuba and the terror list, but that does not mean that down the road the situation will not change, a knowledgeable government official told El Nuevo Herald.Mauricio Claver-Carone, director of the U.S. Cuba Democracy Political Action Committee in Washington, said removing the island from the list would amount to a scandalous concession to the communist government.Claver-Carone wrote in his blog, Capitol Hill Cubans, that the Globe story notes the George W. Bush administration delisted North Korea in 2008, an irony because apparently that has worked wonders in tempering the North Korean regimes criminal behavior.The newspaper quotes one unidentified senior administration official with direct knowledge of Cuba policy as saying there is a pretty clear case that the island doesnt meet the standard for the terror list anymore.The State Departments 2012 terrorism report listed Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan. For Cuba, it noted the governments links to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Spains Basque Homeland and Liberty (ETA).There was no indication that Cuba provided weapons or paramilitary training to ETA or FARC, the report said. But it said current and former members of ETA lived in Cuba. One of them, Jos Ignacio Echarte, is a fugitive from Spanish law and was also believed to have ties to the [FARC], the report said.Reports suggested that the Cuban government was trying to distance itself from ETA members living on the island by employing tactics such as not providing services including travel documents to some of them, it added. Press reporting indicated that the Cuban government provided medical care and political assistance to the FARC.Havana authorities also continued to permit fugitives wanted in the United States to reside in Cuba and also provided support such as housing, food ration books, and medical care for these individuals, according to the 2012 report.Cuba also has strategic deficiencies when it comes to efforts to crack down on terrorism financing and other money laundering, the State Department added.The Castro government has been on the terror list since it was created in 1982, largely because Cuba trained and armed guerrilla movements from virtually every Latin American nation in the 1960s and 1970s.The Globe report came after a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation that included Massachusetts Rep. James P. McGovern, a Democrat, returned from Cuba Wednesday following talks with President Ral Castro on how to improve relations. McGovern said Cuban officials are agitated by their inclusion on the terror list and raised the issue during the talks, according to The Globe.The key stumbling block to Obama administration gestures toward Havana currently is the detention of Alan Gross, a U.S. citizen serving a 15- year prison sentence in Cuba for delivering illegal communications equipment to Cuban Jews under a U.S. government pro-democracy program.Cuba has all but openly offered to free Gross in exchange for five Cuban intelligence agents convicted in a Miami trial. Four are serving long sentences in U.S. prisons and one has been released on probation, which must be served in the United States."\u000a

V"Two major Sacramento streets are about to go on what city officials famously call road diets.Sometime this summer, the city will change a chunk of J Street and part of Folsom Boulevard in east Sacramento from two lanes in each direction to one lane in each direction. Each will get a third, center-turn lane.The changes do not affect J Street in midtown, which is still a scary-fast, one-way, three-lane conduit for commuters.The lane reductions in east Sacramento may annoy some commuters who use those streets to get to and from jobs downtown, as well as some neighborhood residents who may find the drive to the local market a little slower.But officials say the road diets should make those streets safer in general for drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists, and will help the city achieve its goal of reducing fast driving in residential areas.On Folsom Boulevard, the changes will extend through the residential area from 34th Street to 47th Street, stopping just short of One Speed pizza restaurant, where the street is already on a diet.By the way, that means the city can widen Folsom's notoriously thin lanes from 9 to a modern 11 feet, so wide trucks no longer take up part of the next lane.The commercial part of Folsom Boulevard east of 59th Street will stay four lanes.City Councilman Steve Cohn said the changes should stop cars from going 50 mph, allowing residents on foot or in cars to cross Folsom more safely.Part of J Street in east Sacramento already is three lanes. The section from 42nd to 56th streets will now get the squeeze.Road diets aren't new in Sacramento. City officials started experimenting 15 years ago with ways of slowing traffic in residential areas. Initially, they turned some one-way thoroughfares in midtown  like G and H streets  back into two-way streets.Some traffic controls, such as the notorious half-street closures on some midtown streets, still cause ire. But the winnowing of 19th and 21st streets from three to two lanes has turned out well, officials say, even with some commute-hour slowing.The city is not done with traffic calming. The city's general plan calls for more road diets, pedestrian improvements and bike lanes, as money allows.It's not just in residential areas either. Freeport Boulevard in Land Park  a bizarre combo of local street, commute route and train corridor  is headed for a diet, either next year or in 2015, when funding arrives.And just this week, planners with the Urban Land Institute told the Greater Broadway Partnership  a group of businesses and residents  they might want to consider a road diet for Broadway too, as a way to make the street more hospitable for businesses and local residents.Editor's note: This column was changed Feb. 15 to correct the description of lane configurations on Folsom Boulevard."\u000a

V"Clint Parish, a former Yolo County deputy district attorney, faces ethics charges by the California State Bar stemming from unsubstantiated accusations he levied against Dan Maguire last May during their spring campaign for Yolo Superior Court judge.State Bar attorneys filed the charges Tuesday in State Bar Court in San Francisco. They allege Parish knowingly misrepresented Maguire, a sitting Superior Court judge, during the judicial race and knowingly used false and deceptive campaign materials.If the allegations are proved true, Parish could face penalties that range from a reprimand to disbarment, said Robert Hawley, State Bar deputy executive director.""This is a serious charge. The important message is  to respect the system,"" Hawley said.Those making false statements, he said, are ""impugning the integrity of the judiciary as a whole.""The State Bar case focuses on campaign mailers Parish sent last May that sought to tie Maguire to corporate bribery while working for a Colorado law firm in the 1990s, and later to the controversial commutation of the prison sentence of Esteban Nez, the son of political ally and former Assembly Speaker Fabian Nez.Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger commuted Esteban Nez's sentence in 2011. He appointed Maguire, who was a member of Schwarzenegger's legal team for five years, to the Yolo County bench in 2010.The State Bar complaint also alleges Parish falsely referred to himself as a judge and falsely claimed he had been endorsed by the Winters Police Department.On Thursday, Parish and Maguire declined to comment.Parish, an ex-prosecutor who ran on a law-and-order platform, was undone by the campaign claims against Maguire. Those claims stunned and offended the Yolo bench and led a flood of Parish's endorsers to drop their support, including county Sheriff Ed Prieto, former state Senate GOP leader Jim Nielsen of Gerber and county District Attorney Jeff Reisig. Parish, who left the district attorney's office Nov. 16, later fired the political operative who crafted the mailers, saying he himself never verified the claims against his challenger and that there was no evidence Maguire was involved in bribes. The State Bar's disciplinary filing is rare. Just 28 such misconduct cases  including the one against Parish  have been filed by the bar since 2000, say State Bar officials. Of those, 21 cases were closed without an investigation. The Parish case is one of only two since 2000 to proceed to a hearing, officials said. Maguire went on to win election in June.Editor's Note: This article was changed from a previous version to reflect the fact that Parish no longer works for the Yolo County District Attorney's Office.

V"Sacramento County health officials today ruled out the possibility that infectious disease was involved in the hospitalization of a McClatchy High School junior varsity football player on Thursday.""We received a report from the hospital that it was not infectious disease,"" said Dr. Olivia Kasirye, Sacramento County Health Officer.Public health procedures require hospitals, in this case UC Davis Medical Center, to report conditions to county health officers ""right away when a child gets sick,"" Kasirye said.In cases involving public health concerns, ""We're usually the ones that lead the investigation. When we got the report that it was not an infectious disease, there was no need to make any further notifications,"" Kasirye said.Reports of a meningitis scare circulated after McClatchy football games were postponed Thursday night. Even though health experts said it was not necessary, the district performed a deep-cleaning of areas of the school where the student had been, school officials said.Because of medical privacy laws, information on the exact nature of the student's illness and condition were not available.

The Eagles also had two wins each over No. 5 Oak Ridge (when the Trojans were top-ranked) and No. 8 Franklin.Pleasant Grove won its first Delta River League championship after five consecutive second-place finishes to Jesuit.But can a team with only four seniors in key roles win a tournament that has often gone to the veteran teams? The Eagles are counting on it.""The kids have a lot of confidence,"" Pleasant Grove coach Rob Rinaldi said. ""They realize they can play with anybody. If we keep playing well, keep pitching well, hitting, and keep playing great defense like we have, there's no reason we can't keep winning.""Six more wins under heavy pressure will crown the section champion. The North playoffs start Wednesday at Sacramento City College, a change of venue after more than 20 years at American River College. The winners from the North and South play in a best-of-three series in June.Rinaldi has been Pleasant Grove's coach since the school opened in 2005, reaching the playoffs six consecutive times. He previously won championships at Woodland in the 1990s and early 2000s.""That's a very good team, very talented, and Rob always does a great job,"" Jesuit coach Joe Potulny said, adding he wouldn't be surprised if the Eagles won the North and section titles.Pitchers Zach Stilwell and Tyler Rathjen, shortstop J.Q. Folena and outfielder Michael Yanez are the Eagles' core seniors. Sophomore Nico Toni has caught every inning of every game, Rinaldi said, and sophomore Matt Stafford is 6-0 on the mound.Junior outfielder Josh Adams is back in form after suffering a knee injury in the second game of the football season. He hasn't pitched this spring, but he may in the playoffs, adding another arm to a good staff. Stilwell and Folena are three-year starters, and Rathjen has a 5-1 record this season with a 5-3 victory over Jesuit to clinch the league title. In that game, Rathjen tossed six scoreless innings, prompting Rinaldi to say, ""He was just fantastic.""Stilwell is 6-2 with losses to Granite Bay and Davis. He tied the school record with 15 strikeouts and walked one in a 5-0 win over Sheldon. He fanned 13 in a 3-0 win over Ponderosa in what is believed to be the first perfect game in Elk Grove Unified School District history.""He's been incredible,"" Rinaldi said. ""He doesn't walk people. He's fearless.""Stilwell is the calming influence on his team.""I try to stay calm and composed, even though it's not easy sometimes,"" he said, laughing. ""I love to pitch. I love the big games. We have a great team, and our sophomores have been amazing.""Folena is as entertaining at shortstop as he is productive at the plate. He makes diving stops, and he is batting .397 with six doubles, four home runs and 16 RBIs. Folena doubled twice off the wall at Jesuit in Pleasant Grove's 5-3 victory. As a team, the Eagles have 43 doubles and are batting .322.Rinaldi keeps calling his Eagles ""kids."" He said they really are, with more ages closer to 16 than 18.""The kids, I couldn't be happier for them,"" Rinaldi said. ""It was just over a month ago when it all started to come together.

V"The fallout from federal spending cuts over the coming weeks might alter the nations political landscape for years to come.Already, a decade of budget deficits run up in war and economic crisis has saddled the government with a $16 trillion debt, a bill that will force the country to come to grips with how much government it wants and how much it wants to pay for it at the very time the aging baby boomers put new strains on the budget through such vast programs as Medicare and Social Security.Now the government is about to start cutting spending in some programs, offering a first look at how the American people will react.If people feel the sting of the so-called sequestration with fewer teachers at their schools, more time in airport security lines and smaller checks for people without jobs, they might rise up and send a clear signal that the country really wants to keep all of the government it now gets and perhaps feed a demand that the government charge more in the form of higher taxes. If, however, the majority of Americans dont feel any pain from the cuts, if they either dont see an impact or dont empathize with federal employees enduring unpaid furloughs, theyd likely invite more moves to cut spending. That would bolster the Republicans. Either way, its a high-stakes gamble for the two major parties, with the winner likely to dominate the debate and perhaps elections for years.So far, Americans arent paying much attention. Just one in four were following the news closely last week, according to the Pew Research Center.That amplifies the urgency for the parties to try to define the budget cuts on their terms. It also explains why President Barack Obama spent the last two weeks pushing the idea that the reductions are cruel and thoughtless. He needs people aware and angry to bolster his argument for more taxes and fewer spending cuts.The $44 billion thats being trimmed over the next seven months is a less than ideal test for either party.Created by the Obama and Congress in 2011, sequestration was meant to be painful. They thought that the threat of automatic cuts would force them to find a better alternative. It didnt. Democrats insist on adding tax increases and leaving more spending untouched. Republicans want the same amount of spending cut, but would prefer it in different places.Led by Obama, Democrats are betting that the American people will hate the reductions and demand tax increases instead.The danger is that they might have overplayed their hand. First, some of the most extensive and popular federal programs, such as Social Security, wont be trimmed. Second, the cuts will take effect slowly and might not be felt in time to affect the debate over extending government funding past March 27 or whether to raise the governments debt ceiling past May 19.There might be an eventual payoff, though. As the sting of cutting spending intensifies, Democrats think, so will their electoral prospects.This is going to be a slope, not a cliff, said Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.  Democrats also will point to the alternative spending cuts that the Republican-run House of Representatives passed twice last year. No Democrats voted for the plans, which would have made deep cuts in some of Obamas key initiatives, such as a fund to implement the 2010 health care law, as well as housing and food stamp programs.Democrats are aware that their strategy has perils, chiefly that the reality wont match the hype. ""People will see long lines at airports, but they always think the lines are long, said Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J.Republicans, who didnt want these exact cuts, now prefer to keep them rather than leave spending levels intact or raise taxes in addition to the increases in Social Security taxes and income taxes enacted in January. Theyre gambling that the impact is being overblown.We cant absorb that kind of impact in our spending levels? said Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., a favorite of the conservative tea party movement. People will not buy into this idea there will be dire consequences. Though Obamas current proposal involves eliminating corporate loopholes and subsidies, Republicans tar his plan as big governments latest reach into the pockets of the embattled taxpayer. Weve already started to feel, in our states, the impact of consumers having less money in their hands because of the payroll tax having gone up, said Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who was in town for a governors meeting.Republicans also know that their tactics might backfire. Pew found last month that 62 percent saw the party as out of touch with the American people and 52 percent branded it as too extreme. Democrats had far lower numbers. And Obama has the bully pulpit: No Republican is as recognized, and no one Republican speaks for the party the way Obama speaks for the Democrats.Somehow, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said, we have to find ways to cut spending, but do it in a way thats seen as reasonable. The parties do agree on one point: Both sides face the risk that their stubbornness will further alienate already-weary voters.Voters have demonstrated their impatience in recent midterm elections. Democrats retook the majorities in Congress in 2006 and lost the House majority four years later. That suggests that swing voters dont feel loyalty to either party, but instead are skeptical that either side knows what its doing. Now the stakes are even higher, because Washingtons decisions will be keenly felt, perhaps for years.  So under the bravado, politicians are nervous, knowing that their positions might cement their parties images in the publics mind for years to come.Be careful, Republican Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said during a visit to Washington this week.Here we are in Washington, and were all obsessed with government, he said. But people back home are worried about what the economy is doing."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/03/01/5227366/elder-care-company-slammed-defended.html,"The company wanted ""heads in the beds,"" and once they got them inside, there was no ""closing the back door,"" a lawyer argued in a blistering conclusion Thursday in the civil trial against the country's biggest assisted living company.Attorney Lesley Ann Clement said the Emeritus Corp. of Seattle was so obsessed with profits that once it got the old and sick inside its residential care communities, there was only one way out for them.""The only move out that is acceptable,"" Clement said, in an ominous paraphrase of her view of Emeritus' corporate philosophy of the assisted living business, ""is death.""In his closing argument in front of a Sacramento Superior Court jury, Emeritus lawyer Bryan R. Reid unloaded on Clement.He told jurors Clement's game was to bombard them with emotion and irrelevancy, to get them thinking about issues apart from what really mattered in the case.In Reid's view, the trial should have been all about Joan Boice, the 82-year-old retired teacher and the level of care she received during her three-month stay at Emeritus at Emerald Hills, the company's community in the foothills of Auburn.Boice, whose family filed the wrongful death and elder abuse lawsuit against Emeritus, received ""awesome care,"" Reid said, from the time she moved into Emerald Hills on Sept. 12, 2008, until she moved out Dec. 4 of the same year. Boice died three months after her departure from Emerald Hills to a nearby nursing home in Auburn, due to complications that totally stemmed, Reid said, from her advanced state of Alzheimer's disease.""There are not facts that merit a substantial shift of wealth to the Boice family,"" Reid told the jury. ""They lost their mother to a disease, not to the people who were doing battle with a disease.""Nobody from the family complained about Boice's care during her stay with Emeritus ""because what was occurring was what was expected,"" Reid said. The inevitability of her death by Alzheimer's ""wasn't shocking to them,"" he said, ""and it shouldn't have been.""None of the nearly 30 caregivers who were around Boice in the final months of her life, at Emeritus and at the nursing facility, ever reported allegations of neglect or elder abuse to state authorities, Reid said. He called this ""powerful evidence"" that Boice was not abused.Instead, the defense lawyer argued, plaintiffs attorneys followed an ""elder abuse formula"" that seeks to ring up heavy damages in a civil case with a ""bash the corporation"" strategy. It's designed, Reid said, to prejudice the jury against Emeritus.""The weeks and weeks of testimony that we have heard, and all of these things that have nothing to do with Joan Boice, are designed to play to that,"" Reid said.He disputed that Emeritus officials ever made the ""heads in the beds"" and ""closing the back door"" remarks that Clement attributed to them.In any event, ""They don't impact whether the care delivered to Joan Boice was appropriate or whether it caused her death,"" Reid said. ""It's designed to put you in a biased frame of mind.""Boice lost substantial weight and contracted at least four pressure sores that contributed to her death during her three-month stay at Emerald Hills.Clement argued Boice never should have been admitted into Emerald Hills and that she should have immediately been transferred to a skilled nursing home as soon as staffers at the Emeritus residential care facility discovered the potentially life-threatening pressure ulcers within a few weeks of her arrival.The plaintiffs based their case on staffing levels at Emerald Hills that some nights left nobody on duty in the facility's memory care unit where Boice lived.Clement cited testimony that Emeritus' resident nurse knew early on in Boice's stay about the bed sores but instructed a caregiver to ""just don't let anybody know.""Able to get around with a walker when she first moved into Emerald Hills, Boice fell down 10 days into her stay and was never able to get out of her wheelchair again  after which her most serious pressure sore developed on her backside, Clement told the jury.Clement said the company's drive for profits motivated it to accept patients who should never have been allowed in and to keep them inside once they got there. In the meantime, Emeritus knowingly refused to add staff or properly train its employees, in order to keep its costs down, Clement argued.More of a real estate company that a residential care provider, Emeritus ""will do whatever it takes"" to improve its bottom line, Clement told the jury, even if it harms ""our greatest treasures""  older relatives who have been entrusted into the company's residential care network.Clement asked the jury for ""payback"" on Emeritus, but she did not list a monetary amount on the damages she is seeking on behalf of Boice's family. That could come today when she concludes her rebuttal argument. Judge Judy Holzer Hersher will then instruct the jury and send it out to deliberate.The trial has been broken up into two phases. If the jury finds Emeritus liable for elder abuse and wrongful death, with findings of ""malice, oppression and fraud,"" the case would then proceed to the next phase in which the panel would decide the amount of punitive damages."\u000a

He finished second three times in the 100 and second and third once each in the 200, his losses coming against seniors ranked in the state top 10.Mitsch has made a believer of Jesuit sprint coach Rod Jett, a former Hiram Johnson sprint and hurdles star, who initially saw Mitsch as a solid but unspectacular sprinter as a freshman.""You never know how they are going to develop,"" Jett said. ""Austin was pretty solid, pretty fast, but he wasn't a star right away.""Mitsch's coming-out party came at last year's Masters finals where he shocked a field of older runners in the 100 meters by finishing second to Kennedy's Breonntae Snelling and qualifying for the state meet.Jett credits Mitsch's will to improve, intelligence and work ethic for his remarkable improvement.""He's an All-American kind of kid, a young man you love to coach,"" Jett said.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/03/01/5227371/i-want-to-kill-him-alleged-victim.html,"The first sign of trouble at Creative Frontiers School came in June 2000, when a concerned parent called law enforcement with allegations that her daughter had been touched inappropriately.""I want to kill him,"" the young girl told her mother at the time. ""I just want to stab him. I want to make him go away.""Another report on the Citrus Heights school came in six years later, then another in 2007 and yet another in 2010.But it wasn't until 2011, after one more allegation was leveled against Robert B. Adams, that authorities decided they had enough evidence to file charges against the school's former owner and principal.On Thursday, 16 months after authorities charged Adams with child molestation, the first public details of the evidence began to trickle out in Sacramento Superior Court.Three law enforcement officers testified in the opening phase of a preliminary hearing before Judge Kevin J. McCormick, who must decide whether there is enough evidence to order Adams to face trial on six felony counts of child molestation and one misdemeanor count of annoying or molesting a child.It wasn't a particularly pretty day for either side.The 61-year-old Adams, who sat at the defense table with attorney Linda Parisi and his wife seated behind him in a courtroom half-filled with supporters and family, listened as officers recounted allegations that he had molested young girls at his school dating back as far as 1996.But he also heard testimony from a Citrus Heights police officer who said that when he began to look into the allegations in 2011, he found little evidence that earlier claims had ever been investigated.Officer Joe Rangel said his probe began on June 17, 2011, when he met with the parents of a 4-year-old girl who was a student at the privately run school.The girl had told the couple that a few days earlier during nap time, Adams  a popular fixture at the campus who was known to his students as ""Mr. Bob""  was rubbing her stomach and then touched her vaginal area, Rangel testified.That claim  that ""Mr. Bob touched my pee-pee""  launched the probe that shut the school down for good and created national headlines.Rangel said he began to investigate the case and found there had been several past allegations involving Adams touching young girls at the school, but he added that there appeared to be no follow-up from the initial reports on most of them.Rangel began looking into the allegations, meeting with a 21-year-old woman whose case had first been reported to authorities in 2006.That woman had been a 5- or 6-year-old student at the K-6 Creative Frontiers school in about 1996 and had not raised concerns about Adams until much later.When she was 13 or 14, Rangel testified, the girl told her mother at a Mel's Diner outing in Roseville that she had been touched under her shirt by Adams.No report went to police at the time, but a couple of years later the girl, then at Rocklin High School, confided to a counselor that she had been touched by Adams years earlier.The 10-year-old memory stemmed from a presentation by a fellow student on Creative Frontiers, the girl told her counselor.The counselor called Citrus Heights police, and Officer David Jones testified that he took the report and interviewed the girl's mother, who was skeptical about the story.Jones said he tried to reach Adams and sent the case over to detectives for follow-up.Rangel, under questioning from prosecutor Kevin Jones, said he later found no evidence that the case went any further.He contacted the woman, who said she had never spoken to police before, and recounted her allegations to him.Rangel also looked into a report of suspected child abuse filed in 2010, but discovered that the woman who reported it had since died of a gunshot wound to the head. The name of the child suspected of being abused was not listed in any documents, Rangel said.He also looked into a 2007 report but could not find any follow-up on that one, either.The most extensive investigation before Adams was charged in 2011 came from a June 2000 case responded to by Sacramento County sheriff's Sgt. William Bayless.Bayless said he was called to the home of a woman whose daughter  a former student  had indicated that Adams had touched her and some others while at the school.The girl's recollection came after her mother happened to show her an advertisement for Creative Frontiers and led to the girl telling her mother that she ""hated Mr. Bob"" and wanted to kill him, Bayless testified.She and another girl told similar stories and the case was submitted for prosecution but no charges were filed at the time.Those two girls are among the alleged victims in the current case, and Parisi said she believes it is important to note that no charges were filed when the case was first investigated.""I think that it is significant that there was a determination that was unfounded and it went through several hands to get to that determination,"" she said after court Thursday."\u000a

V"Before the start of the spring season, Haley Cameron was wavering between softball and baseball at Davis High School.So longtime Blue Devils softball assistant coach Dave Reuben figured he needed an edge to keep the versatile senior from returning to baseball, a sport she played as a freshman and sophomore.""We met at a restaurant with a couple of other players who weren't sure if they were coming back to play, and I told her, 'Haley, if you play softball again, I'll buy you a frozen yogurt,' "" Reuben said. ""Her response, 'If you make it a big yogurt.' ""Reuben was more than happy to super-size, with sprinkles stacked on top, too.Reuben and first-year head coach Art Guerra saw Cameron as a must-have player if the No. 16 Blue Devils hoped to make an impact in the Delta Valley Conference race and the Sac-Joaquin Section playoffs.A gifted athlete, strong student (4.0 grade-point average) and talented musician (she's a bassoonist in the school's symphonic band), Cameron has the perfect attitude for competition. She's calm and exacting on the exterior; fiery and tenacious on the interior.""I've never seen her lose her cool,"" Reuben said. ""She's always the same, regardless of whether she's struck out or hit a home run. She's got the perfect personality for an athlete.""And Guerra calls the 5-foot-7 Cameron a ""coach's dream.""""She's got a great work ethic, and nothing seems to faze her,"" said Guerra, who coached previously at Natomas. ""She could have two strikes on her, the bases loaded and be down by two runs and she's nonchalant at the plate  but in a great way.""Cameron has spent much of her life playing baseball against the guys, taking in stride the odd looks and snarky comments sometimes directed her way.As a sophomore, she was the left-handed closer and first baseman for Davis' junior varsity baseball team.""It was more about playing time and that they needed me more for softball,"" Cameron said of her decision to play softball as a junior and again this year.""I knew if I played baseball, I wouldn't pitch that much. But I miss it.""Cameron, who has made a seamless transition from being primarily a baseball pitcher to a softball first baseman, leads the Blue Devils with a .490 batting average and has not struck out in 54 plate appearances.""Defensively, she has a great glove,"" Guerra said of Cameron, who has two errors in 104 chances. ""She understands situational hitting, can hit to all fields and with power. I tease her all the time she should be playing softball next year at UC Davis.""But Cameron plans to eventually hang up the glove and spikes, unless it's for an impromptu pickup game, after signing an NCAA letter of intent to play water polo at UC Davis.Cameron, a four-year starter at goalie, made all-Sac-Joaquin Section three times and helped Davis win three consecutive Division I section titles. Last fall, Cameron had 150 saves for her 29-4 team.As much as she loves softball and baseball, water polo is her No. 1 sport, which she hopes to play professionally in Europe. It's also the only sport she plays right-handed.""To me, it's different, it's unusual,"" Cameron said. ""It's violent, aggressive  and I like being in the water.""It's also a comfortable fit.For years, Cameron played club water polo for UC Davis coach Jamey Wright. Cameron's close friend and water polo teammate is Wright's daughter Hailey, another UC Davis recruit.Cameron and Hailey Wright's coach at Davis, Doug Wright, is Hailey's uncle, and several other UC Davis players are recent Davis High grads.Cameron has family ties to UC Davis, too.Her father and mother, Mike and Brenda, are both UC Davis alumni  Brenda manages the marine biology laboratory at UCD  and her grandfather, Hugh Cameron, was a founding faculty member of the School of Veterinary Medicine.Before making the short trek from Davis High to UC Davis, Cameron hopes to give baseball one last hurrah.Over the years, she has played in baseball tournaments in Florida, New York and Australia with a Chicago-based women's team, the Pioneers.""I'd like to do it again, I'm just not sure it's going to fit in with everything I need to do with water polo,"" Cameron said. ""We'll just have to wait and see."""\u000a

Members of Bayside Church in Roseville, where Victor Rodriguez's mother, Jeanne, works, have rallied to help the family and set up a memorial fund. ""This has been unfathomable,"" said Joanna Larrew, who attended the couple's wedding.

For now, friends and family are stepping up efforts to help the family.""Vic and Crystal are incredibly well-liked and very strong in their faith,"" said the Rev. Rob Maxley. He presided over the couple's nuptials at Valley Springs Presbyterian Church in Roseville and has known the couple for several years. He admired the couple's work ethic and commitment to the community. ""They did it the way you want your kids to do it, said Maxley.

V"Anthony Coleman's Simplistic Big Band project brings together a collection of music and musicians that is anything but simple. The consortium of players and vocalists involved likely won't all be together until some point Sunday night when they all are on stage at Harlow's. That will be between 18 and 30 people who could jam the stage performing various aspects of the leader's musical personality.""It's crazy, I don't know what I'm thinking,"" Coleman said of his big band. ""I do it once or twice a year. It's so stressful even though the end result is always great."" For the show, Coleman brings together mainstream players like pianist Joe Gilman and alto saxophonist Patrick Langham, along with hip-hop MCs group Live Manikins, Gerald Pease of the new-school funk band Bucho and neo-soul vocalist LaKeisha Mondy.Gilman and Langham are mentors and teachers from Coleman's time at the University of the Pacific's Brubeck Institute. Gilman has been a longtime instructing artist there, and Langham is the director of jazz studies.""I owe all my musicianship to Joe Gilman,"" Coleman said of the Sacramento-based pianist. ""He taught me so much while I was there."" The 29-year-old, Oak Park-born-and-raised Coleman was selected to attend the Brubeck Institute through an ultra-competitive audition process. It was part of an ongoing broad-based musical education that Coleman has pushed himself through. From the time he first started playing in high school, he's gravitated toward the best players, who in turn inspired him into raising his game.""My sophomore year in high school (Sacramento High), I was thinking about what people were going to be doing. And I thought, 'Nobody listens to jazz. It's probably an easy career to get into,' "" Coleman said, laughing.""Then the next year I met kids my age from Berkeley High School who were just ridiculous and I asked them 'How do you play so good?' They said, 'Practice.' So I started practicing a lot more, hanging with guys who were taking it seriously. I jumped in with the right crowd.""Coleman continued with the right crowd at UOP, where he worked with jazz school namesake and legendary pianist Dave Brubeck. Great musicians like saxophonist Bennie Maupin and Christian McBride taught there, and field trips took Coleman to the Carmel home of jazz enthusiast Clint Eastwood.When Coleman's friends from UOP, including drummer Justin Brown, moved to New York, Coleman moved, too, with the help of a scholarship to the prestigious jazz program at Manhattan's New School. Coleman said that just living in New York made him a stronger musician.""The scene there and the area made me grow the most. I'm not knocking the New School because it was great, but I learned more on the street, playing in clubs, finding gigs, practicing with the guys.""At the New School, Coleman met drummer Vanessa Cruz and the two now have a 2 1/2-year-old son, Anthony Coleman III. Wanting young Anthony to know his Sacramento roots, Coleman and his family moved back here, and he's been making as much music as possible until they ultimately return to the East Coast.Coleman serves as musical director of the Table United Methodist Church and also gigs with various performers such as singer-songwriters Mondy and Emily Kollars. Coleman also leads several jazz bands including a New Orleans-style brass band and an Afrobeat-influenced group called Sankofa.As for the Harlow's gig, the Simplistic Big Band brings it all together with a mainly jazz first set followed by a more free-flowing, hip-hop-influenced second set.""There's a lot of brass, a lot of horns being played,"" Coleman said. ""Every song is different so don't expect the same style all night.

V"Remember those head-spinning days at the turn of the century when the Enron energy trading scandal made the news? Something on that scale will never happen again, we thought. But to paraphrase a concept: Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That our government and our financial institutions subsequently made the Enron malfeasance look like petty theft makes the dramatic satire ""Enron"" all the more sobering.The ambitious, rewarding new production of British playwright Lucy Prebble's ""Enron"" at Capital Stage personalizes the historic shell game of financial manipulation that led to what was at the time the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history. Collateral damage included the largest-ever audit failure by the Arthur Andersen company and the Enron shareholders who lost nearly $11 billion when the company's stock, valued at $90 per share in mid-2000, plunged to less than $1 by the end of November 2001. Prebble re-creates the story through the parallel rise and fall of the two men most responsible for the debacle, company president Jeffrey Skilling and the man he hired as chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.The galvanizing, pitch- perfect performances of Jonathan Rhys Williams as Skilling and Aaron Wilton as Fastow unleash the play's meditation on arrogance and hubris. Greed is nearly an afterthought for the two men, who obsessively want to be smarter than anyone else. Making money in energy trading is how they show off. California's rolling blackouts, which resulted from the energy deregulation they pushed for, are payoffs justified by their ingenuity. Prebble contrasts their twin ascents within the company against the naive, benevolent guidance of Enron founder Kenneth Lay. The sly performance by Gary S. Martinez as Lay never lets us quite know how much he really understands what Skilling and Fastow are doing with their three-card monte mark-to-market accounting or their mysterious shadow companies. Also contrasted with Skilling and Fastow is the excellent Shannon Mahoney's Claudia Roe. Roe is a composite character based on women in Enron's upper management who opposed Skilling's ideas and ultimately helped expose his corruption.The strong ensemble of entertaining side characters and imaginary creatures includes Michael Stevenson, Lucinda Hitchcock Cone, Alexandra Ralph and Andrew J. Perez.The fascinating production receives innovative top-shelf support. Composer Gregg Coffin's original music continually binds the shifting tones of the play while propelling the narrative's creeping senses of urgency and dread. Scene designer Stephen C. Jones, lighting designer Steve Decker, and video designers Decker and Will Klundt create some of the most cohesive and inventive design elements ever seen regionally. Director Stephanie Gularte presents a sprawling, tragic fantasia as an entertainment spectacle. As big a show as this often is, she allows us to feel the human tragedy as well. The narrative cranks up to the top of a mountain and then careens down the road like a convertible with no brakes, throwing screaming passengers out of the car on each hairpin turn.

V"Pleasant Grove High School has a new leader  but the same championship hopes.The Eagles started the football season with uncertainty after quarterback Cody Demps, who led the team to its third Sac-Joaquin Section Division I title game appearance in four seasons, exchanged his cleats for high- tops, accepting a basketball scholarship from Sacramento State.Junior Deaundre Terrell stepped in, and three weeks into the season, that question mark has been replaced by an exclamation mark.Terrell passed for four touchdowns Friday night to lead No. 3 Pleasant Grove to a 29-28 victory over then-No. 2 Nevada Union in the wildest finish in the Sac-Joaquin Section this season.Terrell connected with junior Wyatt Demps, Cody's younger brother and a returning two-way starter, for all four touchdowns, including a 16-yarder with 33 seconds left. Terrell then found fullback Tyree Hanson for a two-point conversion and the win.Wyatt Demps still had enough energy to block a 44-yard field-goal attempt with 10 seconds to go as the Eagles (2-1) escaped with a victory after a similar late-drama setback at Lincoln of Stockton.Terrell completed 17 of 20 passes for 205 yards in the win over Nevada Union.""They've played beyond their years,"" Pleasant Grove coach Joe Cattolico said of Terrell and Demps.

V"Still gridlocked over how or whether to avert the looming federal spending cuts known as sequestration, the two major parties found a new thing to argue about Wednesday: They dont agree on when the budget cuts start going into effect.Republicans said the spending cuts would start Friday. The White House said it was really Saturday. Either way, the seemingly trivial dispute underscored the inability of the two sides to avert spending cuts neither side wanted when they were enacted and signed into law in 2011. President Barack Obama announced plans to meet Friday at the White House with congressional leaders of both parties, but neither side expected any action before the cuts start sometime Friday or Saturday. Indeed, Republicans in the House of Representatives signaled theyre already looking past the all-but-certain start of the spending cuts to the next budget fight, over the legislation needed to finance the entire government.Apart from the cuts in spending to the current budget, the government runs out of money in March and will need an appropriation to stay open through the end of the fiscal year, on Sept. 30. House Republicans said Wednesday that theyd vote next week on a plan to finance the government, but would lock in the $85 billion in spending cuts taking effect soon. That move, certain to be rejected by Democrats, is likely to be part of the White House session Friday.Obama did talk briefly about the budget impasse Wednesday with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., when he joined them for the dedication of civil rights icon Rosa Parks statue inside the Capitol.White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president hoped that the lawmakers would have a ""constructive discussion at their full meeting Friday, but the political sniping suggested otherwise.""Compromise here in Washington can usually be measured by a willingness of one leader to put forward proposals that demonstrate tough choices by his side or her side,"" Carney said. ""What we have not seen from the Republicans is anything like the willingness to compromise inherent in the proposals that the president has put forward.""McConnell complained that the Democrats who control Washington still havent put forward a serious bipartisan plan; not the president and not his allies in Congress. Now, less than 48 hours before the clock runs out, all theyve offered is a gimmicky tax hike thats designed to fail, McConnell added. I hope theyre not expecting a round of applause for this particular act of political bravery.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who visited the White House on Wednesday, said the sequester mess was a pox on both the White House and Capitol Hill.Keep in mind sequestering was an idea that came out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the Senate and House, both sides of the aisle, said Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-political independent. This was something all of these elected officials find a good idea, and I find it fascinating that they are trying to blame each other for it. They all voted for it.As a prelude to Fridays meeting, the White House and Democrats continued to outline the dire consequences that some Americans might find themselves in under sequester. Wednesday was Education Secretary Arne Duncans turn.Briefing reporters at the White House, Duncan listed a series of cuts that would come in the departments biggest areas: $400 million from early childhood education, affecting 70,000 children and 14,000 teachers; $725 million from a fund for poor children, which would affect 10,000 teachers; $600 million from special education, which would affect 7,200 teachers, $86 million in higher education, which means that 70,000 college students might go without grants and work study; and $60 million from areas or regions where Native Americans and military families live.""For us to be thinking about taking steps backwards in all of these areas because folks in Washington cant get their act together in a level of dysfunction in Congress that  its just like unimaginable to me,"" Duncan said. ""I cant tell you how troubling that is to me and, frankly, how angry it makes me feel."" He added that public school systems across the nation would be forced to lay off teachers and shorten the school year in some places. He said that one county in West Virginia already had issued pink slips in anticipation of the cuts. But when pressed by a reporter, he said he wasnt sure whether the layoffs were related to the reductions. ""Whether its all sequester-related, I dont know, but these are teachers who are getting pink slips now,"" he said.The administration and House Republicans are deadlocked over finding an alternative to the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years scheduled to start taking effect soon.Obama has urged Congress to delay the cuts by passing a package of $930 billion in spending cuts and $580 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years by eliminating loopholes that benefit the wealthy and certain industries.The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on a Democratic sequester alternative that would postpone cuts to Jan. 2, 2014; replace reductions through a minimum 30 percent phased-in tax rate on incomes between $1 million and $2 million; eliminate loopholes for businesses that move jobs overseas; cut $27.5 billion from defense; and cut $27.5 billion over 10 years by eliminating direct payments to large farmers.The House has passed two alternatives focused entirely on spending cuts that died in the Democratic-controlled Senate."\u000a

V"A few hours before kickoff between Folsom and De La Salle high schools Saturday, one parking lot on the east side of Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium had become a mass of blue.Smoke and smells mingled from a host of grills. A stereo played KC and the Sunshine Band. Footballs made crossing arcs through the air and a ""Bulldog Nation"" flag hung over several hundred Folsom fans, including Dave Knox, who had transplanted what appeared to be a set of patio furniture from home onto the middle of the asphalt.""We figured first class all the way,"" said Knox, father of Folsom wide receiver Troy Knox, from one of the chairs. ""It's a big game.""For both schools, to be sure, with the winner advancing to next weekend's CIF State Open Bowl. And in regional scope, as evidenced by an announced crowd of 10,197 on a chilly night that was strong if slightly smaller than projected.Ticket windows opened at 3 p.m., with a line of several hundred people stretching out the gate and halfway around one side of the stadium.Tailgates popped up across the parking lots, many schemed in blue or green based on rooting interest.When the gates opened 90 minutes before kickoff, the lines snaked around the stadium, prompting one gate staffer to remark the section hadn't seen such a turnout ""in a long time""  though perhaps it fell short of the overflow crowd in 2010 when Folsom defeated Grant for the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II title.""I think it's bigger than the Grant game,"" Folsom parent Scott Wightman said. ""Because it's De La Salle. They're legendary.""Dave Martin, waiting in the ticket line wearing a De La Salle jacket and cap, said he had made the drive from Antioch. ""It's the first time really that we've played anybody up here,"" he said. ""And as sports fans you're not going to miss a big game, even if it takes an hour and a half to get there.""Indeed, with both teams unbeaten and perennial Bay Area powerhouse De La Salle playing a football game in Sacramento for the first time, the stands featured plenty of neutral clothing, some bearing the logos of other area high schools, including Del Oro, Grant and Franklin.""I'm basically here to see De La Salle play,"" said Phil Barretto, 65, of Sacramento. ""When you think of football, I think you think of De La Salle.""A walk down the ticket line showed that interest had extended to San Francisco and Reno, said Ron Nocetti, the CIF associate executive director.The game included the novelty of being the first NorCal Regional Open showdown, essentially a play-in for the State Bowl.""What tells us a game is important and has garnered the respect of the entire community is when you have your football fans showing up instead of simply the fans, parents and friends of the school communities,"" Nocetti said. ""That's really what we're going to see tonight.""Nocetti said the CIF would make note of how Sac State handled the games this weekend and the level of community interest. Sac State is one of four sites that have entered a bid to be the next host site for the CIF State Bowl games, beginning next year.Other bidders include Hughes Stadium at Sacramento City College and the current State Bowl host site, the Home Depot Center in Carson, Nocetti said. He said the CIF's goal is to announce the next host site by next weekend.""We're obviously going to look and see how the games are this weekend, how the facility hosts the games this weekend, in making the determination,"" Nocetti said."\u000a

V"A West Sacramento police officer was arrested Monday on suspicion of sexual assault and kidnapping, offenses allegedly committed while on duty.The arrest of 37-year-old Sergio Alvarez followed a five-month investigation that began Sept. 24, when a woman told another patrol officer that she had been sexually assaulted by a uniformed officer, Police Chief Dan Drummond said during a news conference.He said Alvarez was immediately placed on administrative leave, and Sacramento Police Department detectives were asked to aid in the investigation.Investigators subsequently identified five more victims, bringing the total to six. The Yolo County district attorney over the weekend convened a grand jury, which handed down an indictment.Drummond said Alvarez was served with termination paperwork on Monday and booked into Yolo County jail. His bail is set at $26.3 million.Alvarez, who is married and a father, grew up in West Sacramento and graduated from River City High School. He joined the West Sacramento Police Department in 2007 and worked as a patrol officer. Drummond said it was Alvarez's first law enforcement job.""I'm personally just appalled and sick that someone who was put in a position of trust would violate that trust in such a despicable an egregious manner,"" Drummond said.The alleged assaults occurred late at night or early in the morning, when Alvarez was on patrol. They covered the period from October 2011 into September 2012. Victims ranged from 20 to 47 years old. All frequented the West Capitol Avenue area. Assaults allegedly occurred inside and outside of Alvarez's patrol car. In some cases, Drummond said, victims were taken to another location.The chief said patrol officers typically work alone. He said the department is studying how procedures might be changed to ensure more accountability.Anyone with information on the case is asked to call West Sacramento police at (916) 617-4775."\u000a

V"Museums  much like libraries  are places where voices are hushed and noise minimal.That was not the case Monday as a new sculpture by Sacramento artist Gerald Walburg was carefully positioned outside the Crocker Art Museum by a steel sledgehammer.""Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,"" rang out over the hum of a boom truck's engine and the roar of chain saws from a nearby tree-trimming crew as Walburg and his assistant Jeff Farley attempted to slide the immense sculpture over four bolts before turning it to lock it in place.""That piece will exist when this building is torn down,"" Walburg said after finishing the installation of his 1,000-pound, 10-foot-high nickel-bronze statue that he named ""Sakti No. 15.""Walburg, a former professor at California State University, Sacramento, said it's the 15th in a series of sculptures he has done inspired by Indian temples. His more famous Sacramento work is ""Indo Arch,"" which extends over the walkway between the Downtown Plaza and Old Sacramento. Walburg said he leaves it to viewers to form their own interpretations of his works.""I'm not trying to tell a story,"" he said.He said he starts with a series of shapes suspended by cranes in his work space. He manipulates them, rotates them and spins them until he finds the relationship he likes, and then he welds them together. Walburg took no compensation for the artwork. The museum also welcomed a new indoor exhibit, ""Rebirth of a Nation: Travis Somerville's 1963"" The mixed media installation by the San Francisco artist was born out of his Southern upbringing and pushes viewers to reassess race relations in America. Somerville said much of his art tries to make sense of growing up in Georgia in a white family active in the Civil Rights movement.""We were very much outcasts,"" Somerville said.One of his work pairs a familiar image of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Nike swoosh; it is Somerville's statement about the ""commodification"" of King's image.Another piece takes the viewer inside a small cabin, seemingly plucked from the woods. Inside, the walls are papered with newspapers of the era. Images of blackface and the sound of a burning cross confront those inside, said Somerville.He said his work aims to spark discussion on race and racism. He dismissed the idea that the election of President Barack Obama means the United States is in a post- racial era.The exhibit of Somerville's work opens Sunday."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/26/5217161/details-of-an-arena-deal-changed.html,"Sacramento's new plan to finance a downtown sports arena may wind up being vastly different than the deal reached last year between the city and the owners of the Sacramento Kings.City officials said Monday they aren't starting from scratch in their quest to develop a financing plan for an arena, but acknowledged in a staff report to the City Council that last year's plan ""and all its detail will likely change in this scenario.""The City Council will be asked tonight to give top city officials the go-ahead to begin formal arena negotiations with a private investment group interested in buying the Kings and keeping them in Sacramento. The council is also being asked to commit $150,000 to pay consultants and attorneys to represent the city.At the moment, the council still hasn't officially been briefed on whom the city will be negotiating with. It's widely known, however, that Mayor Kevin Johnson has been talking to Southern California billionaire Ron Burkle and 24-Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov.The city is under a tight timeline. Johnson has said he will deliver a purchase offer to the NBA by Friday to rival a deal the owners of the Kings have made to sell the team to a group seeking to move them to Seattle. Then the city and the investors will have until mid-April to agree on an arena deal. That's when the NBA board of governors will decide whether to accept the Seattle bid.Both City Manager John Shirey and the mayor have held informal talks with the interested investors in recent weeks. Those talks have progressed to the point that city officials now believe formal negotiations are the logical next step.Assistant City Manager John Dangberg said Monday that the investment group continues to request anonymity.""We are respecting the wishes of the interested parties to remain confidential until they are ready to publicly announce their participation,"" he said. He added, ""the principles being adopted (by the council tonight) can really apply to any potential partner.""Councilman Jay Schenirer said he has not been formally told who the private investors are, but said council members have informally heard about Burkle's and Mastrov's interest.""We need to continue to move forward,"" he said in reference to tonight's council vote. ""What we are spending money on is getting the best people we can to be in our corner to make the best economic decisions for the city. I hear things are moving along, but don't have details on that.""Mayoral adviser Kunal Merchant said the mayor remains confident Sacramento can deliver a Kings purchase proposal to the NBA by Friday. Merchant said it is unclear at this point when and how that proposal will be made public, but he said it could happen at the mayor's State of the City speech Thursday evening.A potential new ownership group for the Kings is one of many factors that will require the city to craft an arena financing plan different from last year's deal.Johnson, Shirey, the NBA and the Maloof family last year negotiated a financing plan for a new, city-owned $391 million arena in the downtown railyard. The plan received the approval of the City Council but collapsed when the Maloofs later backed out.The city's planned contribution of $255 million would have come primarily from downtown parking revenue  either by leasing parking operations to a private firm or by bonding against future parking receipts.In the staff report released Monday, city officials said money from parking was still being considered this year, along with ""land and other assets."" A surcharge on tickets for events at the arena will also be discussed.Dangberg said the city's possible contribution this time around can't be determined until the city updates its parking analysis from last year. The numbers could be different, in part because the new arena may be located at Downtown Plaza rather than the railyard, city officials said. That may mean some key parking spots under the mall that were used to determine a value of downtown parking assets will be eliminated.""We will be bringing in our expert parking consultants (Walker Parking Consultants) and analyze the heck out of this, and advise us what the impacts will be of the Downtown Plaza site,"" Dangberg said.Dangberg said he also does not know whether the NBA and arena operator AEG will participate in the deal. Those parties had committed significant financial support toward last year's plan. He said the city has shared a substantial amount of information with the private group interested in a Kings bid, but does not yet know the details of the proposal that group may bring forward. ""That will all be learned as we begin to explore what it is they'd like to do,"" he said.Tonight's City Council vote comes five months after Seattle officials signed their own tentative agreement with hedge fund manager Chris Hansen on a $200 million arena subsidy. Hansen and Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer have agreed to buy the Kings.Seattle's arena bid continued its push forward on Monday, when Seattle city officials told the City Council that environmental impact reviews should be completed by November. That review process began last month.The formal commitment of public dollars in Seattle wouldn't come until after the environmental review is done. That means the NBA board of governors will vote on whether to accept the Seattle relocation proposal without having a definitive arena plan in place.Officials said Hansen is working with city officials on an interim lease at aging KeyArena, where the relocated team would play for up to three years starting in November. The city expects to have the lease terms ready for the NBA in April."\u000a

But the hurdles continue to mount for a Huskies team that has targeted a NorCal championship since the first day of school in the heat of August.The question is how bad is the finger? Dislocated, fractured or multiple breaks?Sheldon will play host to McClymonds-Oakland in a semifinal Tuesday.""I'm playing,"" said Williams, who had 13 points and five assists and generally controlled things on both ends of the floor. ""It hurts, and I looked at my finger and thought, 'Oh, man,' but I'm playing next week, period. Nothing will hold me back. This is our year.""It has indeed been Sheldon's year, including winning the Delta River League over rival Jesuit and then beating Jesuit in the Sac-Joaquin Section large-school championship last weekend for a remarkable title three-peat.Sheldon (27-5) achieves because it plays a beautiful brand of team ball, anchored by a stout defense to sets off breaks. The Huskies are balanced, with another example against the Pirates. Kyi Thomas hit two of his four three-pointers early and had 19 points, do-all guard-forward Dakarai Allen had nine points, seven rebounds and six assists, Nate Iese muscled inside for 10 points and seven rebounds, and Ryan Manning went for nine points and seven rebounds.But those unkind injuries?In the section finals, the only downer for the Huskies was losing guard Armani Hampton for the season with an ACL injury. He was on the team bench, in jeans and his jersey in spirit, imploring his mates to march on.""We were just talking about how we haven't had injuries, and then this,"" said Sheldon assistant coach Rich Manning, father of Ryan and a standout player for Center High in 1988.Sheldon used depth to help put away Piedmont Hills (28-4) with contributions from Devon Chapple, Antonio Lewis, Jordan Bradley, Chris Haney, Nolan Merker and Taron Johnson.""With our balance, we're hard to guard, and we play good defense,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said.

In February he counted that he had received 112 complaints relating to BP's Alaska operations and 90 from elsewhere in the country since the creation of his office in late 2006.This fall the office is especially busy, perhaps because of increased concern from workers after BP's Gulf of Mexico disaster this year, said Billie Garde, Sporkin's deputy.But the clock is ticking on the ombudsman's office.Though Sporkin said he personally thinks corporations like BP should consider a permanent, third-party ombudsman for workers, the London-based oil company doesn't see it that way.BP says it plans to bring its whistle-blower program in-house at some point -- perhaps as soon as June.To read the complete article, visit www.adn.com."\u000a

V"Democratic Assemblyman Tom Ammiano said Thursday he will try to rewrite state tax laws that he believes allow businesses to avoid higher taxes when commercial property changes hands.Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 California tax change, limits annual tax increases on both commercial and residential properties to 2 percent each year after a sale takes place. When property is sold, the new owner typically pays property taxes based on the new market value.But Ammiano, D-San Francisco, believes businesses are structuring property transactions specifically to avoid triggering reassessment at the sales price. The technique involves ensuring that the new ownership consists of partners, not one of which owns more than a 50 percent stake.Ammiano is not pursuing a voter amendment that would change Proposition 13 in the state constitution. Instead, he wants to write new laws that prevent businesses from avoiding reassessment in such a manner.He has proposed similar ideas before, but they have never reached the governor's desk. Democrats now have a supermajority in both houses, though Ammiano's past bills on the subject struggled to win even support from Democratic majorities."\u000a

V"Roughly 18,000 people attended Saturday's Komen Race for the Cure at Cal Expo, the first since the national organization's ill-fated January decision to stop giving funds to Planned Parenthood  a move it later rescinded.That's a marked decline from the estimated 25,000 that attended the event last year, when 18,899 participated as runners or walkers in the Sacramento area's Race for the Cure.The number of participants in Saturday's race in Sacramento was still being tallied. However, on the eve of the race only 14,000 had registered to race or walk, said Paula Birdsong, executive director with the Sacramento chapter of Race for the Cure.A week ago things were looking grim, with only 8,031 registered. Birdsong said late registration was brisk.""I'm grateful that people are seeing that, in order to keep these services alive, they have to come out,"" Birdsong said. ""We don't want to punish those who need us the most.""In a recent Bee story, Melen Vue, mission manager for the region's Komen affiliate, said that 75 percent of money raised goes toward breast cancer prevention in 19 area counties.Some Sacramento race officials were among those who objected when the national organization cut funding to Planned Parenthood.At Saturday's race, the trademark pink hats of breast cancer survivors and the pink placards, worn on participants' backs and emblazoned with the names of loved ones hit by the disease, were telltale sights.In the 5K race, Christian Morinico was the top finisher, with a time of 16:12.The ill will that the national Komen organization generated with its controversial Planned Parenthood move was still fresh in the minds of some race and walk participants.But it was not strong enough to keep them from attending.""Look, Susan B. Komen paid the price  like hugely. It was one of the biggest PR disasters around,"" said cancer survivor Nancy Sheehan. ""But it's done. It's over with. People should be out here for breast cancer survivors.""Sheehan, who tugged on a survivor's pink hat, did not come alone. For the race, Sheehan was joined by 22 participants, all from the law firm Porter Scott.""I'm past the five-year mark as a survivor  which is the big hump,"" said Sheehan. ""I'm still alive.""She has run the race every year since she received a breast cancer diagnosis in 2006. That year she ran it while on chemotherapy. In her mind there is no therapy better than seeing another survivor in a pink hat at the race.""The best thing, as a breast cancer survivor, is coming and seeing the pink hats and realizing that 'oh my god, all of these people are still alive,' "" Sheehan said. ""Particularly when you see women out here who have survived 40 or 50 years  and especially when you think how bad the treatment was back then.""Some participants came from far afield, such as Felicia Parker, a respite worker from Vallejo. As she waited for the race to start, Parker carried a piece of art board on a stick with a photo of her sister glued to it.""I walk in memory of my sister, who passed away four years ago from breast cancer,"" she said. ""I come every year. I do it for her and I do it for anyone else that needs it. So  this race means a lot to me."""\u000a

V"The British panto tradition, for all its surface anarchy, follows a number of guidelines. That's what makes the plays so fun.There is a ""dame""  a bigger-than-life narrator played by a man in drag. There is a prince played by a woman wearing short pants and boots. The story deals with good triumphing over evil, and at least one animal. In Sacramento, we prefer the panto horse.Local playwright Christine Nicholson has become a master of the form, and her latest, ""Alice in Wonderland: A British Panto,"" is playing at the Sacramento City College Performing Arts Center Auditorium.

V"Youth will be served this high school baseball season with scores of underclassmen in big roles for top area teams.Sac-Joaquin Section power Elk Grove has two juniors who have already verbally committed to accept college scholarships. Rowdy Tellez, a slugging first baseman who committed to USC, could be a high major league draft pick in 2013. Dom Nunez is a smooth infielder who committed to UCLA. The Thundering Herd also has Nick Madrigal, a freshman shortstop who will bat leadoff""We have a young team that's on the rise  and we're looking forward to an outstanding season,"" Elk Grove coach Jeff Carlson said.With six section Division I North titles and four section crowns under Carlson, the Thundering Herd (2-0) stands as the area's highest-ranked team in the state by Cal-Hi Sports at No. 6 and in Northern California at No. 2. Elk Grove has beaten Bee No. 6 Rocklin 7-6 and previous state No. 7 Valley Christian of San Jose 7-1. The 6-foot-3, 235-pound Tellez hit a three-run home run and earned the win on the mound against Valley Christian. Nunez also has played well early.""They're very special,"" Carlson said of the two. ""They go beyond their years with how they prepare  great talents.""Elk Grove hosts two-time defending D-I section champion St. Mary's of Stockton today. The Herd's Delta Valley Conference competition includes No. 3 Davis, with ace Ben Eckels, and No. 8 Franklin, with pitchers Tyler Blake and Josh Pigg.

""When you lose, there's always something you can improve on. We've gotten better, and we can still get better.""The Dragons (20-6, 12-1) are anchored by veteran senior leaders Aaron Cameron (15 of his 21 points in the first half), Joseph Barnes (10 points) and James Hadnot (six points and 10 rebounds), and now suddenly by De'Von Boyd, who played his first minutes of the season.Boyd, a guard, was initially thought to be lost for the season because of a meniscus knee ligament tear on the eve of the season. He rehabilitated to the point of a satisfactory recovery and drew an ovation from a full and enthusiastic Dragons crowd when he entered the game with 4:49 to play and the Dragons in cruise control with a 64-33 lead on the strength of a 31-7 run from the second quarter into the third.Boyd scored on a fast break and hit a top-of-the-key three-pointer.""It feels great to be back,"" Boyd said. ""I knew how much I really cherished this game when I was out. And we needed this game. Losing to Kennedy was our wake-up call.""Cameron, a sharpshooting guard who had six three-pointers, said the future is bright for the Dragons with so many freshmen contributing. They include the team's leading scorer and rebounder, 6-foot-6 Devin Young, who had nine points and blocked five shots. Fellow freshman Christian Terrell had eight points. Jermaine Henderson didn't score, but he played superb defense.""They're really good,"" Cameron said of the youngsters. ""For us seniors, we know this is our time. We're working hard, getting closer and closer to being the team we want to be. It'll be the playoffs soon and it'll be, 'Bring it on.' """"Now, teams can't pack it inside on our big guys,"" Swafford said. ""I'm so happy for De'Von. We're really balanced now, and we can be pretty good.""Joey Healow led Kennedy (16-9, 11-2), which not long ago was the hottest team in the region with a 12-game winning streak, with 13 points."\u000a

V"FRANKFORT  U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnells re-election campaign released its first video ad Tuesday, a parody highlighting the difficulty Democrats are having trying to recruit a viable candidate to run against him.The video is on the newly-launched website www.obamaskentuckycandidate.com. The Republican campaign says it plans to use the website to track Democrats recruiting process.The nearly three minutes video features videos of Democratic President Barack Obama , which has been edited to make it appear that he is searching for a candidate to run against McConnell. Prospects identified include actress Ashley Judd, Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, former U.S. ambassador to Sweden Matthew Barzun and Ed Marksberry of Owensboro, who already has said he will run. The video also features clips of Gov. Steve Beshear, Attorney General Jack Conway, former Auditor Crit Luallen, Auditor Adam Edelen, U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth of Louisville, and Lt. Gov. Jerry Abramson, all of whom have said theyre not interested in challenging McConnell.We all know President Obama and his liberal allies have made Senator McConnell their number one target, Jesse Benton, McConnells campaign manager, said in a statement. We thought we would have a little fun with the problems theyve had finding someone to carry President Obamas banner in Kentucky.The YouTube video was released to McConnell supporters in an email Tuesday morning and posted on Team Mitchs Facebook and Twitter pages.Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Daniel Logsdon said the video shows that McConnell doesnt want to talk about his long voting record in Washington.The only thing he can do is make fun of serious people who are trying to help Kentuckians, Logsdon said. He cant point to any accomplishments.Logsdon said the Democratic Party will have a strong challenger for him in 2014.Asked who that might be, he said that process is in the works.Meanwhile, Nicholasville Tea Party activist David Adams said Louisville businessman Matt Bevin is looking at the Republican primary for U.S. Senate as a Tea Party candidate.Adams said the Tea Party in the state may have multiple candidates to run against McConnell."\u000a

V"March Madness isn't limited to college basketball. High schools have joined the craziness, too.Sheldon, trying to win the region's first boys large-school state championship, returns to Power Balance Pavilion for the third time in a month Saturday. Division I in high school, as in college, has the biggest enrollments, with the top players in the showcase games.Sheldon's opponent, Mater Dei, has been a force in the state for nearly 30 years. The Monarchs of Santa Ana seek a record ninth state championship in a record 13th title game appearance. Led by scholarship-caliber seniors, Mater Dei (33-2) is top-ranked in the state and second nationally.Sheldon, loaded with juniors, is top-ranked regionally and upset-minded.This is how guard Brad Thakham of Bullard of Fresno sized up Mater Dei entering Saturday's Southern California Division I final to the Fresno Bee: ""The way I see it, they put on their socks and shoes the way we do, and we have to beat them.""Nice thought, but Mater Dei routed Bullard 85-66 to earn another trip to Power Balance Pavilion.Though Mater Dei is extremely talented, it's not perfect. The Monarchs lost two close games in national tournaments, and they were challenged in playoff wins over Loyola of Los Angeles (61-58) and Long Beach Poly (63-59).Sheldon (29-5), led by guard D'Erryl Williams, plays unselfishly, defends more than it looks to dunk and maintains its composure. And the Huskies reached the state title game despite several key injuries.They are missing their third-leading scorer, 6-foot-3 guard Armani Hampton, who injured a knee. Williams has a dislocated right finger that was so horrifically yanked to the side by hitting the rim in a recent game, a referee stopped action and blurted, ""Oh gawd!"" Wing Dakarai Allen has taken so many hard spills that most of his back has deep bruises. And forward Kyi Thomas has a swollen ankle that has dramatically reduced his 44-inch vertical leap.Down 17 points in the second quarter to rival Jesuit in the Northern California Division I final Saturday, Sheldon chipped away, then seized control late for a 61-56 victory. The Huskies shut out Jesuit the final 2:06 to become the first Sac-Joaquin Section Division I public school boys team to win a NorCal title in the 30-year history of the tournament. So about that upset. Can it happen? Sheldon can look back to a fellow Delta River League member.The Oak Ridge boys entered the state Division II title game in 2005 as decided underdogs to Mater Dei. But the Trojans stunned the Monarchs, ranked No. 7 nationally, 60-44 behind eventual NBA forward Ryan Anderson and UCLA-bound tight end Ryan Moya. Sheldon also has a bruiser of a tight end headed to UCLA in Nate Iese.In 2010, the Oak Ridge girls, led by All-America guard Sara James, knocked off national No. 3 Long Beach Poly 55-42 for the Division I championship. Many longtime high school reporters consider it one of the greatest upsets in state girls basketball history.Now it's Sheldon's turn to try to pull off a shocker, right here in its backyard.""We have the potential to do it,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said. ""We've grinded a lot of these games out  and I don't think we've played our best game yet."""\u000a

His cultural and religious heritage comes more to the forefront this weekend at SFJAZZ-sponsored Israeli Jazz Fest at the Jewish Community Center in San Francisco. Cohen will play with two of the three groups performing in the mini festival curated by his sister, saxophonist and clarinetist Anat Cohen. On Saturday the collective Third World Love performs with Avishai Cohen, Yonatan Avishai on piano, Daniel Freedman and drums and Omer Avital on bass.Avital is a prodigious composer whose work is featured on the group's just-released album ""Songs and Portraits,"" and his hauntingly beautiful release as a leader, ""Suite of the East"" also is out this week. Both records explore soulful jazz sensibilities infused with Middle Eastern moods and rhythms. Drummer and composer Freedman also has a new record, ""Bamako by Bus,"" which features many of his bandmates here, and recently completed sessions with Sting for a new album.Saturday night's concert features the Three Cohens, as Avishai and Anat are joined by their brother, soprano saxophonist Yuval, in their adventurous family band. The Gilad Hekselman Trio opens this show. Earlier Saturday afternoon will see a duo performance by the tenor saxophonist Eli Degibri and pianist Kevin Hays.

V"The IRS said this week it will start accepting tax returns from most taxpayers  an estimated 120 million households  on Jan. 30, about eight days later than originally expected.But some taxpayers will have to wait until late February or early March to file because of complex tax law changes that went into effect Jan. 1 when Congress passed its last-minute, ""fiscal cliff"" legislation.The delay includes those claiming residential energy credits, property depreciation or general business tax credits. The IRS said it needs more time to update forms that require extensive computer programming and testing.Those delayed deadlines will be posted on the IRS website, www.IRS.gov."\u000a

V"For California's high-income earners, next year's tax bill could be a bit of an eye-opener.That's because, amid all the dire debate in Washington, D.C., about the ""fiscal cliff,"" the impact of another tax issue closer to home has been largely overlooked: Proposition 30.""What's amazing is how few people are talking about it,"" said Kevin Young, a certified financial planner in Davis. ""It's partly because it only impacts a few people.""For most of us, Proposition 30 means only one thing: a quarter-cent bump in the state's sales tax. Even on a big purchase like a $600 flat-screen TV, that's only an extra $1.50.But California's high-income earners  those making more than $250,000 a year  will see their personal income tax rates jump anywhere from one to three percentage points.The new taxes, which are retroactive to Jan. 1 of this year, will be owed on April's state income tax forms. For single taxpayers with taxable income of $300,000, it will mean an extra $500 in taxes, according to state Franchise Tax Board calculations. That's on top of the $25,503 they would have paid had Proposition 30 not passed. For a married couple filing jointly who pull in $600,000, it's an extra $1,000 in state income taxes, the FTB determined. That's added to their current tax bill of roughly $51,000. Their tax rate would notch up one percentage point to 10.3 percent. And for the sliver of Californians who make more than $1 million, their new tax rate hits 13.3 percent, almost a 30 percent rate hike above their current rate. Those increases come amid a dizzying array of new taxes, from local to federal. The result is a taxable landscape that's a crowded, confusing place. ""The reaction from my clients affected by the changes is frustration and concern,"" said Gregory Burke, a CPA with John Waddell & Co. in Sacramento. ""It's incredibly confusing for taxpayers. Not only do we have the state changes, we have tremendous uncertainty regarding federal taxes for 2013,"" on everything from dividends to estate taxes.All the new tax rates and withholding tables are available at www.taxes.ca.gov.The November ballot ushered in additional tax hikes for Sacramento residents. Voters approved a measure to add another half cent to the city's sales tax, bringing it to 8.5 percent. Sacramentans also approved two school bond measures, which will add about $108 to property taxes on a $200,000 house.More dramatic tax hikes lurk on the federal level unless Congress and President Barack Obama can agree on a plan to avert the ""fiscal cliff"" at the end of 2012, when a number of Bush-era tax cuts expire. These would include a jump in income taxes, estate taxes and taxes on stock dividends. Separately, starting in January, two new federal taxes kick in to help pay for health care costs under the Affordable Care Act.In a state where the median income is roughly $61,000, no one is feeling particularly sorry for its biggest earners. But those individuals would certainly feel the impact of the ""double-whammy"" of state and federal tax hits. Obama is pressing Congress to approve increasing taxes on high-wage earners to help address the federal budget deficit.""It's somewhat disheartening when you're depicted as being greedy,"" said Roger Valine, former CEO of Vision Service Plan, an eye care benefits company, who's now a business consultant.""In reality, you're paying a higher percentage of taxes and you're paying a bigger amount of taxes because your base is bigger,"" Valine said.Personally, he says, the bigger tax bite ushered in by Proposition 30 and other tax changes won't drastically change his lifestyle. But he does worry about its impact on the state's business climate, both for small entrepreneurs and bigger corporate firms.""I think the real issue is what this will do to our economy and the desire, or lack thereof, for small or large companies to stay in California,"" he said.Whether the tax flurry will have any effect on spending by high-income earners is unknown.""There's always unintended consequences to tax increases,"" said Rick Niello, president and CEO of the Niello Co., whose fleet of Sacramento car dealerships sells a range of vehicles from $20,000 VWs to $200,000 Porsches and Maseratis. ""The luxury market could be impacted negatively, whether it be cars, jewelry, homes.""But after decades of selling cars, he doubts the city's new 8.5 percent sales tax will put a dent in high-end purchases by high-end earners  even if it means sales tax on a sleek, new $200,000 Maserati will be about $17,000.""I don't think that's going to break the deal. These are emotional purchases and are the result of a lot of research and homework,"" said Niello. ""That person's going to hold his nose  and move right ahead.""In reality, it's a small group of folks who will take the biggest hit from Proposition 30. In 2009, the most recent Franchise Tax Board data available, there were about 65,000 taxpayers who filed tax returns with adjusted gross income between half-a-million and $999,999. Another 34,000 tallied income of $1 million or more.Both Proposition 30 tax increases are called ""temporary,"" with the sales tax due to expire in four years and the income tax in seven years. Until then, as financial planner Young joked, ""I'll just make sure that  my clients only make $999,999 a year."""\u000a

V"No air traffic controllers? No problem.Federal officials are warning that the control tower at Sacramento International Airport could go dark during overnight hours if massive sequester budget cuts kick in. The tower at Sacramento Executive Airport could close altogether.But the man in charge of Sacramento's airports said Monday that operations would proceed without interruption. There are protocols in place for pilots to take off and land even without control towers, said Rob Leonard, interim director of the Sacramento County Airport System.""Is it desirable? No. Can activity continue safely? Yes,"" Leonard said.He said Sacramento International could operate overnight without controllers because of the relative scarcity of traffic.""You need control towers when you have busy congested airspace,"" he said. Only a handful of flights, including cargo planes, typically use Sacramento International overnight.By contrast, he said the FAA would never allow operations to continue without controllers at a facility like San Francisco International.Leonard said Sacramento Executive, home to thousands of general aviation flights each year, could similarly operate even if the control tower is closed completely.As it is, the tower at Executive Airport sometimes goes unmanned, he said.Other airports in the region operate completely without controllers, including McClellan Park and the Rancho Murieta air facility, he said.Sacramento International is one of 72 airports nationwide that could lose overnight air traffic controllers as part of the sequester cuts. About 141 general aviation airports like Sacramento Executive would lose controllers completely.Scott Powell of Sacramento Jet Center, which runs ground operations at Executive Airport, said losing the control tower would likely cost the facility some business. He said operators of corporate jets prefer airports with controllers.The budget cuts are due to take effect Friday, but the impact wouldn't show up at airports until April.All told, about $85 billion is supposed to be cut from the federal budget this year if Congress and the White House don't agree on some sort of alternative. Although the FAA's budget cuts total only $600 million, that agency has put out the most detailed and site-specific information."\u000a

V"Don't tell Connor Mickiewicz that he can't go home again. The determined New Helvetia artistic director continues to shoulder his spunky musical theater company up the hill of recognition and appreciation. Mickiewicz, a Sacramento native, spent several years honing his musical theater craft at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts but decided to pursue his ambition of running a professional theater company, staging contemporary musicals back here in his hometown.This weekend New Helvetia opens Stephen Sondheim's ""Merrily We Roll Along,"" a show that symbolizes the company's creative aesthetic while also offering a cautionary tale to its youthful performers. Based on a 1934 play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, the musical has a book by George Furth plus lyrics and music by Stephen Sondheim. Centered on Franklin Shepard, a former composer of Broadway musicals who has become a soulless Hollywood producer, the story moves backward in time, ending at the beginning of Frank's professional life when he's a talented, idealistic songwriter on the verge of a successful career. It's the eighth show Mickiewicz has staged under the New Helvetia banner since 2009, and it's the most ambitious production in many ways. New Helvetia had been working at the intimate Artisan Theatre on Del Paso Boulevard, an 85-seat performance space perfectly suited to the company's smaller-scale productions. For this show, Mickiewicz has moved the company to the 296-seat 24th Street Theatre.""I don't think the cast would fit on the stage at the Artisan,"" Mickiewicz said. ""And it's also partly because half the cast grew up doing shows on that 24th Street stage. It's a special place for us.""The ""us"" Mickiewicz refers to includes Kiera Anderson, Courtney Glass, Lauren Parker and Nora Babich, who have come from different parts of the country where they are pursuing theater careers. All have origins in Sacramento community youth theater, as do cast members Rosemary Babich and Julia Soto.""We did Ron Cisneros summer workshops, St. Francis High School shows. We did many, many shows there,"" Mickiewicz said.Now he is staging his own production at the theater he knows so well, but there are caveats.""The challenge for us is having to scale back the show,"" Mickiewcz said. ""We don't have enough people, and we have to use a unit set. We're minimizing the costume changes, purely because of the size of our company and where we're at right now.""Mickiewicz is really his company's only staff person. He must get the word out to potential patrons that New Helvetia exists and that it is a professional theater. That means the company negotiates Equity contracts with actors such as Glass and the lead, Matthew Schneider.""We've got a long way to go, but with every show, we've built our audience base  and the shows have gotten bigger in scope,"" Mickiewicz said. ""We need to be doing more shows  right now we only do a couple shows a year. Sometimes I fear we kind of fall off the radar and have to climb back up and say, 'Hey, we're still here.' That's the biggest challenge.""Mickiewicz has cast Schneider, his former NYU classmate and Upper West Side roommate, as Franklin. Schneider directed ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" New Helvetia's inaugural production, but he's content to perform here.""It's an irresistible role and an irresistible show,"" Schneider said. ""It's rich from an acting standpoint, and the score is stunning. I think it's one of Sondheim's most lyrical and beautiful.""Schneider's long working relationship with Mickiewicz provides advantages and complications.""With Connor specifically, I think it's important for me to step back and let him execute his vision. He knows every show up and down, forwards and backwards. He has, especially in this case, a true love of the material,"" Schneider said. ""This is such a huge step for New Helvetia. It's the biggest show they've ever done, by far  the material is incredibly complex; the show's structure is so different."" Glass, who remembers many summers spent in Music Circus workshops and masters classes, said the story resonates strongly with all the cast members.""Being in the creative process with people who are also your friends, working with each other, sometimes working against each other: It helps us remember where where we came from and to stay true to our ambition as artists."" MERRILY WE ROLL ALONGWhat: New Helvetia Theatre presents Stephen Sondheim's bittersweet story tracing in reverse the lives of three friends. At the beginning of the show, the audience sees them as mature, jaded and cynical, but as the story moves back in time, they become bright, enthusiastic idealists on the cusp of their careers.Where: 24th Street Theatre, at the Sierra 2 Center, 2791 24th St., SacramentoWhen: Opening tonight at 8 and continuing at 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Saturdays, through April 21; also 7 p.m. April 15Cost: $15-$30 Contact: (916) 469-9850, www.newhelvetia.org"\u000a

V"Normally, the Grant Pacers line up as a lead stallion in the Sac-Joaquin Section football playoffs.Six times since 1992, the Pacers emerged as section champions, with a state open bowl title in 2008 serving as the program's crowning achievement.In a Division I playoff opener today at No. 2-seeded Burbank, Grant steps into the starting gate embracing an unfamiliar role: dark horse.And at 5-5, the Pacers showed just how wide open this season's large-school field is. Grant lost to top-seeded Franklin in a Delta Valley Conference game when its last-second field-goal attempt for the win was blocked and returned for a touchdown.In Week 2, Burbank beat Grant 36-27 with a punishing ground game that produced 577 yards on 60 carries. John Heffernan, coach of the Titans (10-0), said his team will unleash another ground assault today.In the first meeting, Isaiah Williams ran for 254 yards and two touchdowns. Backfield mates Calvin Green ran for 90 yards and Keith Marcus for 41. Ernest Jenkins, quarterback of the Titans' triple option, ran for 192 yards and three scores.Burbank has three 1,000-yard rushers with Williams (1,640 and 23 touchdowns), Jenkins (1,103 and 12 TDs) and Green (1,009 and 10 TDs). Marcus has 584 yards and five scores. As a team, Burbank is averaging 547 yards and has rushed for 57 touchdowns.Outside of Napa, Grant and Del Oro in early nonleague games, Burbank was not tested in the Metro Conference.""We haven't had a game in which we've been tested in seven weeks,"" Heffernan said. ""We've had mistakes but overcome them easily, but that won't be the case now, not against a team as good as Grant. I'm nervous about that part of it  how sharp and focused we are.""Pacers coach Mike Alberghini said his team has come of age since it was 2-5 in a tough season with even more trying off-the-field issues.""When we were 2-5, it didn't look good,"" Alberghini said. ""We've played better. If we play well, the way we're capable of, good things can happen, and that's what we've put in front of our kids. It's your choice. Go out there and take care of business, and you have every chance in the world to win. If not, then we weren't meant to win in the playoffs.""What adds to the intrigue is how close the programs are. Heffernan and Alberghini are friends and cheer for each other except when on opposite sidelines. The players admire and respect one another.""It adds to it, definitely,"" Heffernan said. ""You're going to gravitate (to) and pull for guys who are a lot like you."""\u000a

Jesuit beat Oak Ridge in the 2011 North finals and is making another title push. The Marauders were 3-2 in last week's Anaheim Lions Tournament with wins over Mission Viejo (6-5), Valencia of Placentia (10-3) and Serra of San Juan Capistrano (7-1).Oak Ridge has wins over Elk Grove (3-1) and Granite Bay (6-4)  both ranked No. 1 by The Bee at the time. The Trojans also have beaten No. 7 Franklin (8-1) and No. 10 Casa Roble (5-0), which features strong pitching.Weather permitting, Jesuit and Oak Ridge will play today, Thursday and Saturday.Stanford-bound Logan James could pitch today for host Jesuit. Oak Ridge uses a committee of pitchers, including Alex Fitchett, Austin Root, Lance Berringer and Jared Ross. Root, a sophomore, is 3-0 with one walk in 19 1/3 innings. Jesuit features slugging shortstop Zach Green, who could be the area's highest-drafted high school player in June.Three-game sets force teams to use different starters against a league opponent instead of throwing the same ace three times.""You're No. 3 guy has to face the best teams this way now,"" Oak Ridge coach Todd Melton said. ""We've been playing solid baseball and getting really good pitching.""Like a lot of teams, we've lost a lot of practice time with all the rain. It feels like we've had three different start times to the season.""

The Broncos have split with Sheldon and lost to No. 12 Yuba City (3-1) and No. 5 Granite Bay (2-1). After a slow start, Franklin was 4-0 in the Fresno Easter Classic, one of the top tournaments on the West Coast. Josh Pigg, Brandon Keup, Kyle Von Ruden and Tyler Blake pitched well for the Wildcats. No. 6 Pleasant Grove went 3-1 in the Fresno tournament, falling to state power Clovis West 4-0. Zack Stilwell pitched a two-hitter in an 8-1 win over Buchanan of Fresno, the 2011 ESPN Rise national champion. Pleasant Grove plays at No. 14 Sheldon today in a DRL game.

Kennedy player earns sportsmanship honorDuring the boys and girls CIF Northern California Regional basketball championships Saturday at Power Balance Pavilion, a player from each team received a sportsmanship award following the six Division I through D-III contests.Lynette Johnson was Kennedy's recipient, and it was easy to see why it went beyond her 19-point, 11-rebound, four-assist performance in the 56-38 loss to Berkeley in the D-I final.Whenever the hard-charging junior collided with a Berkeley player, the 5-foot-10 forward was quick to help up her fallen rival.Johnson even did so when she was called for an offensive foul  her fourth foul  near the Kennedy basket in the fourth quarter.The foul could have easily been called against her opponent.""I know people look up to me, so I need to show sportsmanship at all times,"" Johnson said.

V"Nearly two years ago, Casandra Campbell was fighting for her life. For six days, the Campbell family kept a solemn vigil around her bed at Kaiser Roseville. The 19-year-old had accidentally overdosed on prescription medication.Casandra, or Cassie as she was known to friends and family, was brain dead. But a year earlier, she had signed on to become an organ donor.""We were praying for our daughter to survive,"" said Cassie's father, Dave Campbell. ""And in some way, she did.""Today, Casandra lives on. Her organs have saved the lives of five people. But the choice to be a donor especially touched Gabby Preap, who received Cassie's heart 12 hours after she died in April 2011.On Valentine's Day, the Campbells and Preap united in Roseville to thank nurses and doctors who helped make the transplant possible. The Campbells were overcome with emotion, as they exchanged hugs and wiped their tears, introducing Preap to the staff that took care of Cassie.""She got the gift of life from our daughter,"" said Dave Campbell, hugging a teary-eyed Preap. ""That's the beauty of it all.""""It's a new beginning,"" said Preap, 23, of Long Beach.Nearly two years ago, Preap was on the cusp of death. At age 17, she had contracted a heart virus. Doctors told her that without a transplant, she had little more than two years to live.""I felt myself dying,"" she said. ""My chest was hurting, and I couldn't breathe.""She had gone 2 1/2 years without a transplant. But what was happening with Cassie in Roseville changed that.""I started crying,"" said Preap, recalling the phone call from the donor coordinator. ""It's one of those feelings where you've been waiting and waiting, but at the same time, someone is dying.""Back in Roseville, the Campbell family was struggling to come to grips with Cassie's impending death. But they were ready to fulfill the wishes of their daughter.Nationwide, 117,000 people are waiting for an organ transplant. There are 1,300 people awaiting an organ in the 11 Northern California counties served by Sierra Donor Services, the agency that matched Cassie with Preap. Many don't live to receive a transplant, said Tracy Bryan, Sierra Donor Services spokeswoman.""On Valentine's Day, it is very important that people think about giving the gift of life  being a donor,"" Dave Campbell said. Thursday wasn't the first time the Campbells and Preap have bonded. They have shared a funnel cake at Santa Monica Pier and visited New Mexico for a donor conference.""I take a lot of comfort,"" said Brittany Campbell, Cassie's younger sister.

V"The Sac-Joaquin Section had a good showing in the first Northern California Regional football championship games, with three of four teams advancing to this weekend's CIF State Bowl games in Carson.In Division I, Granite Bay plays Long Beach Poly at 8 p.m. Friday. Oakdale, the section Division III winner, plays in the Division II Bowl against Serra-Gardena on Saturday, and Central Catholic of Modesto is in the Division IV game against Santa Fe Christian of Solana Beach on Friday.Folsom, the section Division II winner with a 14-0 record, lost to national powerhouse De La Salle of Concord 49-15 in the NorCal Open game Saturday at Sacramento State. But almost everyone loses to the Spartans, who stretched their unbeaten streak against Northern California opponents to 238 games since 1991. De La Salle has won the last three State Open Bowls.Despite the loss, Folsom is No. 1 in The Bee's final rankings, beating out Granite Bay.Fifteen journalists and coaches who were at Sac State and have seen both De La Salle and Granite Bay agreed that the Spartans would have beaten the Grizzlies, too.""This doesn't take anything away from our guys,"" Folsom co-coach Kris Richardson said after the loss. ""I'm proud of how we competed. We'll be back.""De La Salle coach Bob Ladouceur said applying pressure on Folsom quarterback Jake Browning was key. Browning was sacked six times in the first half, but he still passed for 284 yards and two touchdowns. Browning finished his sophomore season with a state-record 5,248 passing yards and 63 touchdowns, second-most in state history.""You can't just let that kid sit back there and pick you apart,"" Ladouceur said. ""He's a phenomenal quarterback. He really is. He's really special.""More De La Salle  Spartans coaches used the crowd cheering against them as motivation for their players in the program's first game in Sacramento. The announced crowd was 10,197, though longtime stadium officials thought it was closer to 14,000.""I think they all came here to watch us lose,"" Ladouceur said.Added defensive coordinator Terry Eidson on the crowd: ""Of course we (brought it up). We were going to play in front of a big crowd against a great team. A lot of people around here felt that had we played some teams up here, we might not have completed the streak (a national-record 151-game winning streak from 1992 to 2004).""Optimist banquet  Seniors competing in the 56th Optimist All-Star Football Classic on Dec. 22 at Del Oro will meet at a banquet at the Dante Club at 7 p.m. today.Notable players for the North include Del Oro running back Brandon Monroe, Grant safety Trayvon Henderson, Antelope wide receiver Tyler Winston, Nevada Union quarterback Kyle Cota and linebackers Hank Humphers, and Tanner Vallejo, Inderkum defensive end Dedric Allen and Placer defensive linemen Stone Sander and Eddie Vanderdoes.The South will be led by quarterbacks Jason Samuels of Oak Ridge and Josiah Johnson of Sacramento; running backs Robert Frazier of Elk Grove, Isaiah Williams of Burbank and Kyran Harris of Franklin; defensive linemen Quincy Capel of Folsom and Zack Claiborne of Oak Ridge; and defensive backs Jalen Walker of Christian Brothers, Marcus Green of Franklin and Phillip Carter of Folsom."\u000a

V"Steve DaPrato insists everything is in working order from the neck up. He is back in football, coaching for one simple reason:""I failed retirement,"" DaPrato said Monday afternoon. ""I can't stay away from the game.""DaPrato, 61, is the new coach at River City High School in West Sacramento after a mere 27-year gap from his last high school coaching job at Elk Grove in 1985.In between, DaPrato had assistant coaching stops at Sacramento City College and UC Davis and head-coaching stints at Modesto Junior College, New Mexico Highlands and Chabot College in Hayward. DaPrato retired from Chabot as athletic director last year and for years has lived in West Sacramento.DaPrato grew up in West Sacramento, where many who were raised there want to give back. DaPrato's father, Willie, is synonymous with the city. He owned and operated Willie's Market on 15th Street from 1949 to 1979.Willie, still spry at 87, encouraged his son to look into the River City job  or continue losing to him twice a week on the golf course.""We had Easter egg hunts in the 1950s and '60s in the grass next to the market, gave away bikes,"" DaPrato said. ""Our family has always been involved in the community.""DaPrato developed his work ethic at Willie's Market. He worked as a meat cutter and retail clerk, saying, ""I worked for two unions before I got into teaching and coaching.""DaPrato's wife was student body president at James Marshall High School (before the school was renamed River City) when she went by Johanna Gieling. DaPrato was the chairman of the bond measure committee that allowed River City to move to a new campus in 2009, churning some Raiders blood then. But the real clincher was Chris Baker.Baker, also of West Sac, coached the Raiders to their finest season in 1987. A River City teacher and longtime Raiders assistant coach, Baker will coach with DaPrato. Baker took over the program last fall after head coach Art Bustamante was placed on leave and later arrested, accused of molesting four female students.""My God, Chris Baker is phenomenal, a great coach  and we're related by marriage,"" said DaPrato, whose niece is married to Baker's nephew. ""Coming back here, it's a perfect way to give back to the community.""DaPrato's 1984 Elk Grove team was his best. The Thundering Herd finished third in the Delta League but won the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship behind running backs Brian Brown and Greg Folena.Around the region Lou Baiz has replaced Max Miller as the defensive coordinator at Folsom High.Baiz was the defensive coordinator at Sac State and offers years of experience.Miller coached Folsom's defense in 2010, when the Bulldogs won a state Division II bowl game. Folsom returned to the section title game last season. Miller said he was offered and declined Folsom's defensive backfield post, saying the turn of events ""blew me right out of my saddle."" Frank Negri, the 77-year-old football coach with a zest for one-liners, will join Larry Cunha's Roseville staff as an assistant. Negri won 248 games at Foothill and Natomas, second most in section history to Miller's 257. Tom Ingles is Bella Vista's new football coach, having won 248 games and three state titles in Washington. Ingles, inducted into the Washington State Football Hall of Fame in 2005, replaces Matt Polston, who resigned after five seasons."\u000a

V"The Folsom Bulldogs are a team for all seasons, all elements and all comers.Enduring the best pass rush it has faced all season and sideways rain into their face masks from whipping winds at Sacramento State, the Bulldogs belted Elk Grove 44-18 Saturday night to win their second Sac-Joaquin Section Division II championship in three seasons.On the topic of all comers, Folsom (14-0) now likely braces for a new storm in the form of De La Salle, the decades-long national power from Concord in next Saturday's first Northern California Regional Open game at Sac State to decide who plays in the elite CIF State Bowl game Dec. 15 in Carson.De La Salle (13-0) crushed Logan of Union City 52-7 for its record 21st consecutive North Coast Section D-I championship.Those Spartans have not lost to a NorCal foe since 1991, a remarkable run of 234 games.Folsom quarterback Jake Browning, a sophomore who has played beyond his years in this record-breaking season, passed for 205 yards and three touchdowns, and he had a one-yard scoring run.Browning overcame a sluggish start in facing a quick, attacking Herd defense determined to throw him off his game with blitzes.Browning's 61 touchdown passes are tied for the third most in state history for a season. The record is 63 by Robert De La Cruz. He set the mark in 1999 for Cathedral High of Los Angeles.Browning could equal  or break  the record against the best defense Folsom will face, perhaps ever, in De La Salle. The Spartans will line up four Division I recruits against the Bulldogs.Browning threaded nifty passes on over-the-shoulder strikes, proving gusty weather doesn't bother him, either. He hit Troy Knox for scoring strikes of eight and 51 yards and Bailey Laolagi for seven yards. Not bad for a program whose spread offense is still challenged by skeptics that suggest rain is best suited for power run teams.""We hear that  'Folsom's all glitz and glamour with the precise passing'  but we also have a tough-guy mentality, and we can trap you on run plays and run over you, and we can hit you on defense,"" Folsom co-coach Kris Richardson said last week. ""We can do it all.""The Bulldogs did it all in 2010, too, in winning a state D-II title in the mud and muck. The trend continues as the Bulldogs just missed hitting their game average of 47 points.Folsom took apart an Elk Grove (12-2) team that sought to avenge its playoff loss to Folsom last season that ended its season at 12-1.Folsom has a running game this season to complement its passing game  and first-year starter Browning.Laolagi ran for 72 yards and a 12-yard touchdown, and Harry Lipnosky went for 61. And the defense under coordinator Lou Baiz refused to let the vaunted Herd wing-T run game dictate any tempo. Wadus Parker rushed for 77 yards on eight carries.The Bulldogs' defense has been anchored by linemen Chaz Arnold and Quincy Capel, linebacker Derek Stiles and defensive back Phillip Carter, who had an interception. Still, for all the offensive firepower and defensive clout this season, Folsom coaches are blown away by how fast this group jelled.""The expectations are there, and it's fun and exciting, and we thought we'd be pretty good, but we knew we were young and inexperienced,"" Richardson said. ""We thought we'd be in the mix. We got off to such a great start this season, then got that momentum. The kids all bought into the weight training, the system, everything.""Elk Grove will return a lot of talent, including Parker and quarterback Tommy Arnold, for a title run next season.""Folsom is a complete team, a fantastic offense and an underrated defense,"" Herd coach Chris Nixon said. ""Browning is a special talent. I don't know if I've seen a better sophomore quarterback."""\u000a

V"Hughes Stadium is home to the high schools again with McClatchy and Christian Brothers returning to the Sacramento City College venue this fall.The schools kick off a renewed era in the 84-year-old facility by facing each other tonight at 7. CBS and Jesuit square off for the annual Holy Bowl next Saturday in a rivalry game that is expected to draw up to 16,000 fans.Tonight marks the first prep contest in the refurbished Hughes, including a new FieldTurf surface. The renovation cost $13 million.Hughes was built to house the city football programs. It featured Metro League action throughout the 1980s with a Thursday, Friday and Saturday menu of games. The tradition stopped in the early 1990s when the Metro schools deemed it more cost-effective to play home games on campus. But portable bleachers and bathroom units, small crowds and blistering hot Saturday afternoon contests often made for an apathetic atmosphere.Malcolm Floyd can relate, and he can recall what it was like to play at Hughes. The McClatchy coach and former Lions Bee All-Metro wide receiver who played at Fresno State and briefly in the NFL once pulled in 70-yard touchdown strikes at Hughes, powering McClatchy to the 1989 Metro League championship.""I am so happy our squad is able to play at Hughes,"" said Floyd, who went by Malcolm Seabron as a prep. ""It was a treat when coach (Bob) Sandoval and coach (Brad) Klopp would lead us on the field at Hughes when I played.""Friday nights were special, but football at McClatchy lost its allure when we played on our freshman field.""Floyd said he hopes Hughes will attract more numbers and pique more interest in his program. The Lions (0-1) have 28 varsity players, including senior Nick Modar, a three-year starting quarterback whom Floyd describes as ""a great athlete and a great student.""CBS (2-0) has 48 players and has made big strides coming off a 1-9 season.The Falcons are led by quarterback Caden Noon, wide receiver Jalen Walker and lineman Vinnie Johnson, a verbal commit to Iowa State.""We're all very excited to play at Hughes, the new field, and people are talking about it,"" Walker said. ""It'll be fun to play McClatchy, and then Jesuit. We know Hughes is special."""\u000a

V"The success of Folsom High School's spread offense in recent years hasn't been based solely on the accuracy and tenacity of its quarterbacks.It starts with the protection of the offensive line.Despite a group of blockers with virtually no starting experience, the No. 3 Bulldogs this season are in business as usual. Folsom routed then-No. 4 Oak Ridge 49-21 in a Delta River League opener Friday night in El Dorado Hills with quarterback Jake Browning completing 37 of 48 passes for 353 yards and six touchdowns. He had no interceptions and was sacked once.""From our first game until now, we've exceeded expectations,"" Folsom co-coach Kris Richardson said. ""We knew we had a nice quarterback, some good skill players, but how would the line do? They've been great. We always feel that if we can protect the quarterback in our scheme, we can do good things, and Jake and the line have been outstanding.""The line consists of Mike D'Ottavio, Josh Wormley, Dalton Bledsoe, Reed Garmsen, Cody Creason and Austin Rothrock, whom Richardson calls his ""sixth man.""Wormley had one start in 2011 before suffering a knee injury.Garmsen also had just one start last fall, Bledsoe didn't play football, and D'Ottavio missed the season with a shoulder injury.With co-coach Troy Taylor tutoring Browning and calling offensive plays, and Richardson mentoring the O-line, the Bulldogs are averaging 393 passing yards, 111 rushing yards and 46.3 points. Browning, a sophomore, has passed for 2,363 yards and 25 touchdowns. He has six interceptions in 253 attempts.Other Folsom weapons include wide receivers Phillip Carter (10 touchdowns), Troy Knox, Rodney Ellison, Luke Owan and backs Bailey Laolagi, Harry Lipnosky and Josiah Deguara.Bruins' uprising  Bear River is 6-0 and has secured its 24th consecutive winning season. The Bruins have won three consecutive road games, including Friday's 24-14 effort over Colfax. Quarterback Dillon Smith passed for 243 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown to Tevyn Kimble, and Michael Raigoza had two of the Bruins' four interceptions. Friday will bring a huge test at No. 5 Placer, which could be seen as the Pioneer Valley League championship game. Bear River's long successful run is a remarkable show of consistency under veteran coaches Terry Logue and Scott Savoie.Logue shared his humorous wit while watching film Saturday.""As I come back to reality today, and start watching Placer film, I feel sick to my stomach,"" he said. ""Not from any postgame party but from how good they are and trying to figure out how to slow them down. The only answer I came up with is to try and sneak 12 guys out there, and that may not be enough.""Rocklin thunders  It wasn't shocking that then-No. 14 Rocklin beat No. 7 Nevada Union in a Sierra Foothill League opener. That the visiting Thunder crushed the Miners 35-9 on homecoming night registers as a complete surprise. Daniel Kniffin and Logan Webb each passed for two touchdowns, and the defense had eight sacks while allowing the Miners just 40 rushing yards on 30 attempts. Et cetera  Yuba City rushed for 440 yards and rallied to beat host Inderkum 49-42, ending the Tigers' five-year, 27-game Tri-County Conference winning streak.

V"A meeting of the administration, coaching staff and parents of 12 seniors no longer on the Rio Americano football team is scheduled for Monday evening in the school library.The seniors, including Mark Lyon, a star quarterback-linebacker, turned in their gear Thursday in protest after Rio Americano coach Christian Mahaffey wouldn't reinstate senior wide receiver-defensive end Guillermo Salazar, a three-sport standout at the school.Salazar was forced to quit the team Tuesday when he informed Mahaffey he would miss the Raiders' Oct. 13 home game against Whitney to attend a weekend baseball showcase in Arizona.Salazar, who also plays basketball, is a highly recruited baseball player.Mahaffey said Salazar couldn't remain on the team if he was going to miss a Saturday Capital Athletic League game to attend an out-of-season event.Parents hope Monday's meeting will lead to the players, 10 of whom were starters, being able to rejoin the team.""Some of the boys have been together for four years and are very close to Guillermo,"" said Erin Lyon, the Raiders' team mom and Mark's mother. ""They knew for a long time that he had this (baseball) commitment, so it was like, 'We play, if he plays.' """"I don't think it was handled well by the boys or the coach. Both sides could have approached this differently.""Mahaffey said he gave the protesting players a day to think about their decision after meeting with them Wednesday. He said they turned in their gear the next day.""It all surprises me,"" Mahaffey said. ""I was hopeful the guys would come back. But we were prepared if it didn't happen.""Mahaffey said the situation has driven such a wedge between the players who have left and those who remain that he believes it can't be repaired with a meeting.""At this point, it is too late,"" Mahaffey said. ""It's done. The kids that are going to play the next five games are the 21 we still have on our team.""""It will be bare bones.

The Raiders open league play Friday at Cordova.Toeing the line  As a former high school and college quarterback, Kirk Anderson spent most of his career coaching skill players.But the first-year Mira Loma coach has focused most of his attention these days coaching up the offensive and defensive lines.""I've done skill stuff my entire life,"" Anderson said. ""But if you don't have a line, you can't do anything.""Anderson is fortunate to have a smart and experienced quarterback in senior Wes Van Der Mik.""At times, I'll let Wes run the practice while I take the O-line, and we get down and dirty,"" Anderson said. ""It's really not fair to him, but he's accepted the role; he enjoys the role.""On-the-job training  New Foothill co-head coach Jesse Phillips admits working 2 1/2 seasons as an assistant coach isn't a lot of high school experience. But he learned much working the previous two seasons under Matt Ray at Antelope.""It helps having that experience of being around a great program,"" Phillips said. ""Matt taught me a lot.""Foothill won its first game Friday 33-27 over Natomas."\u000a

V"Friday's matchup between No. 8 Placer and Northern Section power Foothill of Palo Cedro will be more than just the marquee game of the two-day, seven-game Football for Families Showcase in El Dorado Hills.A potential berth in the inaugural CIF Northern California Regional playoffs could also be at stake when the two teams play at Oak Ridge High School at 6 p.m.Placer is ranked No. 1 and Foothill No. 4 in this week's Cal-Hi Sports' Division II NorCal State Bowl rankings. Both are coming off impressive season-opening wins last Friday.Behind its quick wing-T offense, Placer defeated small-school power Central Catholic 48-30 in Modesto, a program that has won more Sac-Joaquin Section football championships (15) than any other school.Foothill posted a 50-33 victory over Reed of Sparks, Nev., the returning Nevada large- school runner-up, as Cougars junior quarterback Ryan Pollard (15 for 17, 251 yards) set a single-game school record with five touchdown passes.In the past two seasons, Foothill has gone 20-4 and lost twice to Paradise in the Northern Section Division I championship game.Eastern League rivals Foothill, Paradise and Enterprise of Redding have upgraded their schedules to try to improve their chances of playing in the NorCal playoffs Dec. 7-8 at sites to be determined.Paradise opened the season with a 28-7 loss to No. 7 Grant, followed by a 49-12 win over Napa. Enterprise gained 444 total yards in beating No. 13 Del Campo 45-14 in Redding last Friday.For the defense  Jesuit quarterback Thomas Sperbeck says he played more at free safety in Saturday's 45-7 win over Rio Americano than he did on defense all of last season.And he had a blast. Midway through the third quarter, he shot past the line of scrimmage to drop a Raiders ball carrier for a one-yard loss.""I love playing defense  I love hitting,"" Sperbeck said.First-year coach Marlon Blanton has no problems with his quarterback making tackles.""Our goal is to put our best athletes on the field to have success,"" Blanton said. ""Thomas is one of those guys.""Section teams in bowls  The Sac-Joaquin Section's Division I and Division II football champions are guaranteed spots in the NorCal Regional playoffs, either in the Open Division or the D-I North final. The Central Coast Section Open Division and North Coast Section D-I champions (traditionally De La Salle of Concord) also will qualify.The only decision for the section commissioners will be which two teams play in the Open Division game.Winners will advance to the State Bowl games Dec. 14-15 at the Home Depot Center in Carson.Return to Sac State  Sac-Joaquin Section Commissioner Pete Saco says the D-I and D-II section title games and, possibly D-III (depending on the teams), will return to Sacramento State for the next three years, via contract.Saco says Hornet Stadium is preferable to Hughes Stadium at this time because of field security issues.Family act  Ponderosa quarterback Jake Bist threw two touchdowns to his brother Josh in a 63-0 win over Valley.

An influx of Cuban immigrants brought their cigar-making craft to Florida in the late 1880s. As workers carefully hand-rolled each cigar, they were read to by a lector, typically a learned, sophisticated man, who provided the workers news and entertainment. Both traditions lasted until the 1930s when the Depression and mechanization severely diminished the industry. In this play set in 1929 in Tampa, Fla., a new lector named Juan Julian comes to a factory in decline and begins reading Leo Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"" to workers dealing with their disappearing livelihood. Two-time Elly-winning actress Kristine David makes her directorial debut with Teatro Nagual's production of the poetic drama. David's cast includes Martin J.

You probably have to see the show to understand just what that means since the popular Arthurian legend dates to folklore known before the 12th century, when French writer Chrtien de Troyes added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story of Arthur as a great warrior king. Shakespeare is of course the greatest writer in the English language, so if this new ""King Arthur"" has been truly written in his style, then huzzah.Hanson directs his own script with a cast including Brent Bianchini as Arthur, Breanna Reilly as Guenevere, Rob August as Lancelot, Bradley Moates as Merlin, Sara Hanson as Morgan and Anthony Person as Mordred. Tickets are $18 general, $15 for students. Children ages 6 to 12 are free. Children under 6 not admitted. Parking is $2.

V"Christof Innerhofer of Italy won his third World Cup downhill of the season Saturday, on a course where he has a history of good results.Innerhofer bested three Austrians to earn his sixth career victory, covering the 2.58-kilometer (1.6-mile) Kandahar course in 1 minute, 37.83 seconds to beat Georg Streitberger by 0.12 seconds.Streitberger was the 30th runner out of the gate - last of the top skiers - and Innerhofer wiped his brow symbolically when the Austrian crossed the line. Klaus Kroell was 0.16 seconds back in third.Hannes Reichelt was fourth and world champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway finished fifth.The Kandahar course was shortened after heavy snow over the past few days made the preparation of the entire run impossible, but was still longer than the super-G slope.Innerhofer failed to win a medal at the recent world championships in Schladming, Austria. But he won three medals when the worlds were held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 2011 - gold in the super-G, silver in the super-combined and bronze in the downhill.The Italian now has four career downhill wins in the World Cup.Innerhofer jumped to third place in downhill standings, behind Svindal and Domink Paris of Italy. Svindal is 15 points ahead of Innerhofer.Svindal is 169 points behind overall World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher of Austria, who did not race in the downhill.

V"I spent four years at Chico State, graduating last May, but I didn't tour nearby Bidwell Park's most elusive swimming holes until I was assigned this story.I'm kicking myself now for not taking the time earlier to trek among the basalt boulders and pebbled beaches in the upper reaches of the park.The high canyon walls, deep pools and dancing trees make Salmon Hole's beauty hard to beat. Although you're just 15 minutes from Manzanita Avenue and the drive-through gate into Upper Park, it seems like you're all alone there.""The water's clearer and cleaner and past where (most) other people swim,"" said local Justin Blum, who tries to make it to the swimming hole at least four times each summer.With more than 3,600 acres of diverse landscapes stretching 11 miles from downtown to the Iron Canyon Fish Ladder, Bidwell Park offers a variety of swimming experiences  from mellow wading and a lifeguard-supervised creek pool in Lower Park to secluded, rocky and potentially dangerous spots in Upper Park. If you explore, you'll find territory to call your own.Thousands of summer swimmers take refuge under the trees, on the banks and atop the rocks of Big Chico Creek, sharing the cool water with deer and playful pollywogs as red-shouldered hawks wheel overhead.And it's only a 90-minute drive from Sacramento.ENJOYING BIDWELL PARKConsidering a visit to Chico's 3,618-acre municipal park? Here are some tips. Vehicle gates open at various times starting at 5:30 a.m. and close one hour after sunset. Smoking is allowed only from Nov. 2 to April 30. The tolerance for alcohol is zero. All dogs must be kept on a leash after 8:30 a.m. Bring along water shoes if you're unaccustomed to walking around on hot, rough rocks. If you go to an unsupervised swimming hole, bring life jackets for children. Bring mosquito repellent, sunscreen and drinking water. Call the ranger station, 965 Fir St., at (530) 896-7834 to make sure that the area you're visiting is open. Chico Creek Nature Center offers kids a place to interact with nature.

V"D'Erryl Williams and Jasmine Ware reflect the image of complete high school basketball players, and it's no wonder their coaches and peers rave about them.Both were tough and determined players this season, competing  while inspiring their teammates  through injuries to lead their teams deep into the postseason.Ware of Sacramento and Williams of Sheldon, the two best players on the area's two best teams, are The Bee's Boys and Girls Players of the Year.""Jasmine was our Energizer bunny,"" Sac High coach Michele Massari said. ""Speed, power, athleticism, heart, determination  she did everything. She embodies everything we believe in with heart and hustle and grit. She's an all-time-great player.""Said Sheldon coach Joey Rollings of Williams: ""D'Erryl, what an awesome kid, one of great character. He's humble, works hard in school and in basketball, an amazing kid you'd want as your own, a role model.""A 5-foot-10 combo guard, Ware scored on drives, runners and three-pointers  in addition to playing frenetic defense. The senior averaged 14.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.0 steals and 2.0 assists for the 26-7 Dragons.Sac High was The Bee's top-ranked team all season, beating every area team it played. The Dragons won the Metro Conference with sweeps over other high-ranked Bee teams  Kennedy and Florin  repeated as Sac-Joaquin Section Division III champions and reached the Northern California Regional semifinals.Ware, a 3.5 grade-point average student, will attend UC Santa Barbara on scholarship.Williams, a 6-2 junior point guard, was the driving force for Sheldon. He was difficult to stop on drives as a crafty left-hander, and he could pop the short jumper or runner.He averaged 14.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 3.2 steals for the 29-6 Huskies.Sheldon was The Bee's top-ranked team for all but one week. The Huskies swept No. 2 Jesuit and highly touted Pleasant Grove in the Delta River League, and three-peated as D-I section champions with a win over Jesuit.Sheldon again beat Jesuit in the NorCal D-I final and became the section's first public school to reach the D-I state championship game, losing to Mater Dei of Santa Ana.Williams, a 4.0 student, is being recruited by college programs.Meeting for a photo session this week, Ware and Williams agreed ""basketball is our life""  each refusing to let injuries slow them this season.Ware was injured in a Metro opener against Florin and feared her season was done. Fortunately for Ware and the Dragons, she suffered only a deep knee bruise and soon returned.The knee scare paled in comparison to Ware's real loss. Her mother, Darlene Ware, died from kidney failure two years ago.Ware teared up in recalling the final days with her mother. Since then, Ware has been taken care of by her older brother Demond Philson, a local lawyer.""You don't get over something like that,"" Ware said. ""It pushed me to work even harder in school, to get in the gym more, to be better in everything. I'm lucky to have so many good people around me to make up for my loss.""Williams suffered a dislocated small finger on his right hand in the NorCal playoffs and vowed to keep playing. In the state title game, a strained hamstring limited him against Mater Dei, though he still scored a team-high 13 points.""There was no way I wasn't going to play,"" Williams said.Jesuit coach Greg Harcos called Williams one of the toughest competitors he's seen in 25 years as either a player or coach.""That's a great honor,"" Williams said. ""I love to play. I play hard and I take pride in how I play. ""I like being a leader, having the ball in my hands, and I take pride in my defense."""\u000a

V"Wadus Parker of run-oriented Elk Grove High School has a simple motto.Stop us if you dare.With the Elk Grove wing-T in extra gear through most of three quarters and the defense refusing to buckle, the host Thundering Herd held off Del Oro 35-32 in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division II semifinal every bit as good as advertised Friday night.The Herd unleashed three 100-yard runners, with Parker leading the charge. He gained 131 yards, including a 64-yard touchdown for a 35-17 lead in the third quarter that ultimately proved crucial. A flag was thrown on the play, and referees met for a moment before waving it off. Replays didn't show any holds.""Tough game like we thought it would be with them,"" Parker said, ""and it's like my dad says: 'Someone has to stop the run, and until they do, keep running.' ""Robert Frazier rushed for 101 yards and a score to surpass 2,000 yards this season. Fullback Spencer Sheff, normally the lead blocker, had 102 yards to help put the Herd in the D-II title game for the first time.Elk Grove has five D-I titles, from 1984 to 2001. The Herd (12-1) will face a familiar foe in Folsom, which belted Buhach Colony in the other semifinal. Folsom eliminated Elk Grove 42-28 in last year's semifinals.Del Oro, the section D-III winner in each of the past two seasons, bowed out at 7-6 but not without a fight.Brandon Monroe rushed for 194 yards in his third successive monster playoff outing. He scored two touchdowns, including a 12-yard run to pull Del Oro within 35-24 late in the third quarter. He also caught a six-yard touchdown pass from Zach LaBar, and LaBar hit Tyler Mateer for a two-point conversion as the Golden Eagles closed within 35-32 with 56 seconds to play. But Elk Grove recovered the onside kick.LaBar epitomized his team's grit by playing with a twisted knee in the fourth quarter. Monroe also battled injuries this season as Del Oro endured a murderous schedule. He will play on scholarship at San Jose State next season.The Herd, meanwhile, will play at Sacramento State next week with revenge in mind, not to mention a shot at a NorCal Regional game, an area first to determine State Bowl berths next month in Carson.The steady performer amid all the runners for Elk Grove has been quarterback Tommy Arnold. He opened the scoring with a 30-yard pass to Elijah Jones and found Parker on a screen play that Parker broke for a 35-yard sprint to the end zone on the last play of the half for a 28-17 lead."\u000a

V"Jake Browning is the latest in a long line of Folsom High School quarterbacks putting up prolific numbers running the innovative and evolving spread offense of coaches Kris Richardson and Troy Taylor.Saturday, in the No. 3 Bulldogs' 56-35 Delta River League win at Jesuit, Browning threw for 367 yards and six touchdowns.The 6-foot-2 sophomore completed his first 16 passes and was 20 of 22 for 234 yards in the first half as the Bulldogs took a 35-7 lead.Browning spread the ball to nine different receivers  senior Nick Owan and junior Rodney Ellison each had nine catches and a touchdown  as Folsom (7-0, 2-0) scored on its first five possessions against the faltering Marauders (4-3, 0-2), who started the season 3-0.Through seven games Browning has passed for 2,731 yards and 31 touchdowns, including 10 when he made his debut Aug. 24 against Woodcreek.""He's a really special kid,"" said Taylor, the former Cordova, Cal and New York Jets quarterback. ""He's very consistent, makes good decisions, and he's obviously very accurate.  I think he's the best player in the area, and he's only a sophomore.""But in one big way he's a lot different than his Folsom predecessors, Tanner Trosin (Cal Poly), Dano Graves (Air Force) and his brother David Graves (Hawaii), or, for that matter, Saturday's opposing quarterback, Thomas Sperbeck, who better fits the mold of recent Folsom quarterbacks than does Browning.All are highly mobile. Trosin and the Graves brothers also were Folsom's rushing leaders while setting passing records.Sperbeck's the same way.Even though Jesuit was out of the game early, he kept things interesting with his feet and arm. He rushed for 252 yards, including touchdown dazzlers of 77 and 72 yards. He passed for 128 yards and two scores, including a 54-yarder to Jason Elenberger on the game's first play from scrimmage. ""He's fast and very athletic,"" Browning said of Sperbeck, who also played most of the game at free safety.The gangly Browning is still trying to find his sea legs.So he could poke fun at himself when his number was called for a quarterback keeper inside the Jesuit 1-yard line early in the first quarter.It took Browning two attempts and a Jesuit penalty before he punched the ball across the goal line.""That was pretty bad,"" said Browning, who has only four rushes this season. ""But we have really good running backs, so they take the load off my back.""Folsom junior Harry Lipnosky rushed for 85 yards on 10 carries and caught a touchdown pass. Sophomore Bailey Laolagi rushed for 67 yards and a touchdown in seven carries.In other games:Sacramento 41, Rosemont 21 in Oak Park  Josiah Johnson completed 28 of 37 passes for 408 yards and five touchdowns and ran for a score as the Dragons (5-2, 3-1) downed the Wolverines (4-3, 3-1) in a Metro Conference game.Louis Macklin had eight catches for 132 yards and two touchdowns and Damen Wheeler five catches for 122 yards and two scores.Whitney 36, Rio Americano 6  Sutter Choisser rushed for 114 yards and three touchdowns, Drew Romo passed for two touchdowns, and J.R.

V"Living Here|Sac Moms Club & Family",http://www.sacbee.com/2013/03/05/5235687/readers-weigh-in-on-high-school.html,"DEAR READERS: Mailbag time. Thanks to all who have written to me and shared their stories or opinions. Here are a few letters I have received about some recent Teen Talk columns:HI KELLY: Great article about high school seniors. So many school traditions are on the wane because kids are in such a hurry to grow up and ""get out.""You are spot on  those traditions, friends, influential coaches and teachers help define a lifetime. Hopefully the class of 2013, my son included, slows down enough to soak it all in and realize what a special time in their lives today is. FHHI KELLY: I just read your column re: teenage girl is 'kinda"" sure she's ready for sex. As a mother of four, I would be very angry if that was the only advice you gave my daughter. Shouldn't the message also have been that she is a minor and needs to get through high school? Even if she is 18 and a straight-A student, high school is challenging and a sexual relationship should be very far down the list of things to do. There is no doubt that starting a sexual relationship would be a major distraction, regardless of how mature she is.Don't get me wrong. I agree with what you said in part, but shouldn't we as adults and role models set a higher bar for our children than the ""think it over and make sure you make the right decision"" speech?Honestly, I give children all the respect in the world to be their own person, make the right decisions, etc. But I really feel the best advice we can give our teenagers is to help them find the most successful paths to the rest of their lives, help them get their priorities straight, then support them and accept them regardless of what they decide. KathyKELLY: Shouldn't you use the word ""abstain"" when it comes to giving advice to teens about sex? Tell them the truth: They are not old enough to have sex and should focus on other things like school, family and spirituality.Why rush it? Whatever happened to the idea of waiting until marriage?Wouldn't that be the best advice for you give to a young person who is ""kinda"" ready for sex? JustinHI KELLY: I'm a mom with an 11-year-old daughter. I enjoy your column very much  your advice is very insightful. I'm just writing because your column reminded of something I heard on NPR. It was an interview with (Supreme Court Justice) Sonia Sotomayor. She described how she would pursue things she couldn't do, such as swim and dance lessons, even if she never got very good at them. She also had a cute story about practicing for throwing out the first pitch at a baseball game. I recommend that you listen to it because it's very much in line with your article and may be helpful to your point. DebraDEAR KELLY: Thank you for your column. I read it all the time and agree with you often. However, I'm prompted to add my two cents about the column of the mom who won't eat in front of others.The story from the daughter shrieks of an eating disorder on so many levels. How do I know? My own daughter is in recovery for bulimia nervosa and was in intensive treatment for many months. Our family received treatment as well as much education. Avoiding eating with other people is one of the symptoms of an eating disorder. The mom's constant remarks about her weight and that of her daughters are another.I bet if you showed the column to the therapists and doctors at my daughter's treatment center, they would agree the mother is suffering from ED.I could go on and on, but in my humble opinion, this mom needs help. It's not just about a social phobia. I fear the daughters will grow up to have their mother's skewed perception of weight and beauty. JS"\u000a

V"The federal budget ax is poised to chop $46 billion from defense spending, and communities around Texas military bases are bracing for the impact.Automatic budget cuts that could start Friday would furlough 52,000 civilian Defense Department employees and cause $275 million in lost gross annual pay in Texas, according to White House projections.The Army said its reductions could result in a $2.4 billion economic loss in Texas.Some Republicans question whether President Barack Obama and the Pentagon have overstated the effects of the budget sequester, but leaders in military communities say they expect fallout.""There is a lot of uncertainty right now, and that always causes concern,"" said John Crutchfield, president of the Greater Killeen Chamber of Commerce, which sits next to Fort Hood. ""Many of the people stationed at the base live in our community, so when something happens to them, it is felt in the community.""Texas, Virginia and California are among the states that experts say could feel the biggest sting from defense cuts. Texas has 131,548 active military personnel, the most in the country, according to census data. It has 48,057 civilian personnel, behind only Virginia and California.Former Army Secretary Pete Geren said that in the short term, the cuts will fall most heavily on the military's training and quality-of-life budgets.In Texas, those reductions will be most noticeable at large training bases like Fort Hood, Fort Bliss in El Paso and Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.""However, the real problem with this unpredictable funding process is you just can't plan,"" said Geren, now president of the Sid W. Richardson Foundation in Fort Worth. ""Military leaders don't know not only how much money they are gong to have, but when will they have it? It just injects chaos into the system.""Blue Angels grounded?At Naval Air Station Fort Worth, almost 2,200 civilian workers face possible furloughs.And a planned appearance in October by the Blue Angels at the Fort Worth Alliance Air Show may be canceled, according to a Navy report.At least one major air show has already been canceled because of budget cuts.Potential fleetwide actions include canceled or delayed deployments and reductions in training programs and investments in ships, aircraft and weapons, Navy documents say.Fort Worth Councilman Dennis Shingleton said that, judging from discussions with base leadership, he doesn't believe that reductions at the naval air station would have an immediate effect on the city.Should the budget changes lead to talk of base realignments or closings, he said, his concern would rise dramatically.""I haven't heard any official word that there is"" talk of realignment, said Shingleton, whose district includes the base.""But I tell you that if there is any hint of that, we would absolutely mobilize to make our argument for the joint reserve base, which is integral to the economic continuance and solvency of this community.""'It's going to hurt'The Red River Army Depot in Northeast Texas could see a $597 million reduction, a cut that local leaders say would directly affect their communities.Mayor Mike Baab said business owners in Hooks, a town of 2,800 that borders the depot, expect less traffic to and from the depot.""It's going to hurt,"" Baab said. ""It will affect us economically for sure because when people travel to Red River, they stop at our eating places and truck stops for lunch. I imagine our sales tax revenue will go down.""At Fort Hood, warnings about furloughs, downsizing and service reductions were shared with civilian employees and their families at town hall meetings.Fort Hood has about 6,000 civilian employees who would face losing up to 16 hours from their paychecks every two weeks, said Cheryl Eliano, local chapter president of the American Federation of Government Employees.A hiring freeze has already left more than 100 jobs unfilled, and sequestration would further strain staffing, she said.""We have a lot of angry and upset folks right now,"" she said. ""Some people are wondering how they are going to make it.""Crutchfield, the president of the Killeen chamber, said that despite community concerns, the area may be somewhat protected by Fort Hood's size and diversity.The post has many missions and numerous commands, so the cuts may cause less trauma there than at an Army depot with a narrower purpose.Fort Hood's annual economic impact on the state is $25 billion, and much of that occurs in surrounding Bell, Coryell and Lampasas counties, Crutchfield said.Use common senseThe Killeen business community generally agrees that the size of the government should shrink, but that process should involve logic and common sense, Crutchfield said.""Cutting DOD expenditures 10 percent across the board is kind of tying the hands of commanding generals, who know how to defend the country,"" he said. ""We've got a three-star general who is a smart guy and knows how to do this, but he's not allowed to use his judgment to decide what to cut.""Jim Riddlesperger, political science professor at Texas Christian University, said sequestration should be viewed as a process rather than a deadline.""The thing to understand is that the impact may not be felt immediately because it takes time for people's budgets to be constricted,"" Riddlesperger said.""Therefore, Congress has several opportunities to correct the imbalances that may take place with the cuts. Odds are that even if we get to sequestration -- and there is some indication we will -- many of the problems will be corrected in the weeks and months to come."""\u000a

V"It's a most unorthodox way that Bear River's 21st Sac-Joaquin Section championship banner  and first in track and field  came to hang in its Lake of the Pines gym.In the section's Division II-III championship meet last May at Bella Vista, then-junior Kendal Nielsen won the long and triple jumps and placed fourth in the 100- and 200-meter dashes.She scored all 28 of her team's points.It wasn't until later that night that she realized she had single-handedly beaten 20 other D-III girls teams.""I had no idea it was even possible for one person to win a team title,"" Nielsen said.She was handed the section banner a week later at an impromptu ceremony at the Masters meet at Elk Grove High.But it never crossed Nielsen's mind to just take the blue-and-white triangular felt banner and hang it somewhere prominently at home.""I won it for my school,"" Nielsen said. ""I love representing my school, and I like seeing that banner in the gym and knowing that it's our first in track.""That's Kendal Nielsen, says Bear River athletic director Duwaine Ganskie.Modest almost to a fault, she's a gifted athlete and superlative student. With her blond ponytail and 5-foot-7, 118-pound frame, Nielsen looks more like a distance runner than one of California's top female high school jumpers.""What she did is pretty amazing,"" said Ganskie, a longtime basketball coach for the school. ""It's probably happened before, but I've never heard of anyone around here doing what she did.""But what's striking to me is that, around campus, Kendal is such an ordinary, nice kid. Until she gets on the track. Then you see the beast come out in her.""Michael Reid noticed the same trait when he first saw Nielsen at an all-comers meet at Natomas High two summers ago.The American River College assistant coach was working the triple jump pit when Nielsen, a former gymnast and a solid but unspectacular sprinter, decided to give the triple jump a try on a whim.On her first jump, she cleared just over 34 feet  which would have easily won the Pioneer Valley League championship a few weeks earlier.""I remember it like it was yesterday,"" Reid said. ""I'm measuring 34 feet, one-half inch, and she's telling me she's never (triple) jumped in her life. This was not normal. It was rather shocking.""Nielsen was taken aback by Reid's initial reaction.""I felt completely uncoordinated, and then there's Michael flipping out, going crazy. He's telling me he'd love to have the chance to train me, that he could get me to the state meet.""An incredulous Nielsen took Reid's business card, but it would be months before she took up his offer.It turned into the perfect melding  Nielsen's unwavering work ethic and dedication combined with Reid's infectious enthusiasm and constant encouragement during their rigorous training sessions at ARC.Nielsen has progressed so well that in addition to rewriting Bear River and PVL records in the jumps and sprints, she has won nine league titles and three D-III section titles.In February, she signed a national letter of intent to compete for Cal Poly. Nielsen has an interest in journalism, a 4.2 grade-point average and hopes to pursue a degree in environmental science.She's also closing in on the ultimate goal that Reid set for her three years ago: Crack the 20-foot long jump and 40-foot triple jump barriers before heading to college.Nielsen is getting close.She had a personal-best 39-5 triple jump April 7 at the Arcadia Invitational, the fourth-best mark in the state and ninth best in the nation this season. Eight days ago, she long jumped a section-best 19 feet, 3 1/2 inches, more than a foot beyond her previous best.""Twenty/40 seemed an unreal goal three years ago,"" Nielsen said. ""Now it doesn't seem so ridiculous.""Barring an injury or some unforeseen circumstance, Nielsen will have several more shots at 20/40, including Saturday's Meet of Champions at ARC, the Masters championship May 24-25 at Elk Grove High and the CIF State Track and Field Championships on June 1-2 in Clovis (where she was unable to reach the finals in either of her specialties last season).Another single-handed D-III section team title repeat is not a goal.""Even though I'm having a better season, that's not an expectation,"" Nielsen said. ""I'm just going to do what I always do  try to do the best I can."""\u000a

V"There may be no crying in baseball, but there once was in wrestling for Bella Vista High School senior dynamo Shayne Tucker.Tucker is state-ranked No. 1 in the 152-pound weight class by the California Wrestler with 32 wins (15 by pin) and three losses.He already has won two Sac-Joaquin Section Masters championships and will go for a third this weekend in Stockton.As a sophomore, he placed fourth at 130 pounds at the CIF State Championships, then took second last year at 138 pounds only a few weeks after he thought his season had ended prematurely because of a knee injury.Yet Tucker admits that during his formative years, starting at age 6, he spent almost as much time shedding tears as arm bars.""I remember crying after every match,"" Tucker said. ""I'd bawl my eyes out because I wanted to win so bad.""Tucker was trying mightily to keep up with brother Colton and cousins Grant and Landon Burkhalter, all two years ahead of Shayne. His father, Mark, a Fair Oaks pastor who played baseball and wrestled at San Juan High School, would haul the kids to youth tournaments throughout California and Oregon.""Sometimes I'd have to wrestle Landon because we were similar weights,"" Shayne said. ""Then we'd both be crying because we didn't want to wrestle each other.""Mark Tucker, an assistant Bella Vista coach and longtime director of the Broncos youth feeder club program, even remembers the tears flowing from Shayne when he was winning a match as a 7-year-old.""I'm going, 'What's wrong? Are you hurt?' because he's crying while wrestling,"" Mark recalled. ""When the match gets over, he blurts out, 'I just want some real food.' He'd been eating apples and other healthy stuff because he had to watch his weight between matches. But he wanted candy.""Said Shayne: ""I wanted a Snickers bar. I've always loved sugar.""Since then, those close to him have called him ""Sugar Shayne.""""People hear us calling him Sugar Shayne and they think it's because he's a pretty slick wrestler, but it's because all he wanted to do when he was a kid was eat candy,"" Mark said.But anyone who watches Tucker in action these days realizes he's a pretty sweet wrestler.""He's a way above average athlete,"" said Bella Vista coach Mike Lee. ""You could put him in any sport and he'd excel. He played baseball. He was the quarterback on his Pop Warner football team.""His P.E. teacher was telling me the other day that whatever sport they're doing that week, Shayne is usually the best in the class. Combine that with his putting in the time and a family that supports his dreams, and it's a good package.""Rene Delgado, who coaches Bella Vista rival Casa Roble, has watched Tucker mop up on his wrestlers for the past four seasons.""He's been wrestling for so long, so he's got the experience,"" Delgado said. ""But this year he's even more businesslike. He takes a guy down, puts him on his back once or twice and then he's done with him.""Christian Brothers senior Chris Rios was pleased to last into the second round before being pinned by Tucker during their 152-pound Division II section championship match Saturday.""You get that right away that he's special,"" said Rios, who also lost to Tucker in the finals of the Capital Valley Conference tournament. ""His setups and technique are crazy (good). His stance is ridiculously low, so you can't shoot on him. He's just an all-around good dude.""It was at the D-II section tournament last year that Tucker was forced to default to his opponent from Granite Bay in the 138-pound final.""I heard something pop in my knee in practice, and it was really hurting in the tournament,"" Tucker said. ""We even scheduled an MRI, thinking that my playoff run was over.""But instead of a tear in his left knee, as feared, Tucker had a stretched tendon. The next weekend he pinned three opponents and won two other matches by major decisions to win the Masters, then advanced to the state final before falling 4-3 to College Park of Pleasant Hill senior Brian Sergi.""Once I found out my knee wasn't that bad, it kind of took a lot of stress out, and I just went out and had fun,"" Tucker said.Tucker has been a member of four consecutive league championship teams at Bella Vista. He helped the Broncos win two D-II dual team championships, and Saturday the Broncos added a D-II divisional title banner, too.Now, Tucker hopes to become Bella Vista's seventh boys state champion, joining three-time winner David Lee as well as Ken Gaudreau, Tony Kitchen, Mark Loomis, Lynn Mason and Tracy Yeates.Then it will be on to college, where he has a visit scheduled with Oklahoma, his dream school, in April. He's also getting interest from other major programs, including North Carolina State and Central Michigan.""It's a little harder for California kids to get recruited because there are so few D-I programs (three) in the state,"" said Tucker, who placed fourth at the prestigious Walsh Ironman tournament in Ohio last December. ""So it gives you a little more drive to set your goals higher.""While there are no tears these days from Tucker, it could be pretty emotional for father and son should Shayne reach the top of the victory stand Saturday at Masters, then again March 2 in the state finals in Bakersfield.But it may be dad crying this time.""Every time we do a tournament this year, it's special because it's the last one of Shayne's high school career,"" Mark Tucker said. ""I'm just glad to be his dad. I'm proud of him. He's a good young man.""""If he wins state that would be great because he's worked so hard. But if it doesn't happen, as long as he does his best, I know he can live with that."""\u000a

His parents feared he had a lacerated liver, which fortunately wasn't the case, and he spent 43 hours in intensive care.Sepeda hasn't let injuries stop him. Saturday, he scored a takedown with 7.6 seconds left in regulation to break a 1-1 tie and defeat Victor Raygoza of Orland 5-2 for the 220-pound title at the seventh annual Tim Brown Memorial Tournament at the Sacramento Convention Center.For Sepeda, there was a bit of payback. A week earlier, Raygoza beat him in El Dorado Hills.""It was redemption,"" Sepeda said. ""I don't like losing to the same guy twice.""Through all of his injuries, Sepeda said the only pain he thinks about now is in losing.""I've been hurt for so long, it would hurt more to lose knowing how hard I've worked,"" he said.Tourney runs smoothly at new site  After an eight-year run at Memorial Auditorium, tournament director and Foothill coach Bill Lum needed to move the tournament this year because of renovations to Memorial.Heading to the Convention Center, with its larger floor space, Lum said there was greater availability to stage more matches at once. So much more that 14 mats were being used Friday when the first day of competition ended just before 7 p.m.  more than three hours sooner than in 2012 at Memorial.But Lum is not ready to make a permanent venue change.""The good was we got all of the rounds of Day One done and got out at a reasonable hour,"" Lum said. ""But the Memorial has such great seating to watch from.""Lum credited his staff for running a smooth tournament. Most of the staffers have been with him since the event's inception in 1997 as the Foothill Invitational. Inspiration from a late friend  During his sophomore year at Sheldon, Sam Alnassiri lost a close friend, then-senior wrestler Jimmy Doan, who died of a congenital heart disease.Alnassiri said he told Doan he would make it to the state tournament, and after coming up short as a junior, the senior is 25-1 with 25 pins this season after pinning Sam Woods of Rocklin in the 285-pound title match Saturday.""I lost my best friend,"" Alnassiri said. ""I told him I would make state for him. I fell short last year. That is my main goal now.""Rivalry at the top  As two of the top three ranked wrestlers in California at 170 pounds, Keaton Subjeck of Oak Ridge and Peter Santos of Oakmont have built a friendly rivalry after seeing each other so often at top tournaments.The seniors  the third-ranked Subjeck is headed to Stanford, and the second-ranked Santos is leaning toward Navy or North Carolina State  chat with each other between matches, but when they are on the mat, it's all business.Last year, Subjeck beat Santos in the Tim Brown 160-pound final. But Santos won the Sac-Joaquin Section 170-pound Masters final a month later, while Subjeck placed second at 160.Saturday, Santos decisioned Subjeck 5-1 in the title match.""It's not a priority,"" Subjeck said of winning. ""I love winning, but it's not the end of the world. Just wrestling him and getting a good match in is what I want."""\u000a

V"Gary Smith felt like a proud father as he watched No. 13 Davis play Valley Christian of Roseville in Saturday's Seventh Annual Common Good Classic showcase fundraiser at Antelope High School.Smith, now retired, developed ""The System""  the up-tempo scheme he used as a longtime coach at the University of Redlands. His 2004-05 team set a national scoring record (132.4 points a game).Valley Christian and Davis adhere to Smith's unorthodox, love-it-or-hate-it brand of basketball.So even though Davis, the Sac-Joaquin Section's largest school, handily beat one of the section's smallest by an eye-popping 134-55 in a game that included 58 turnovers, Smith still saw a thing of beauty.""I think it's great  I love it,"" Smith said of the first area meeting of teams using his full-court pressing defense, breakneck offense and five-man lineup changes every 20 to 45 seconds.For Davis (13-7), the 134 points was a school record, even with a running clock in the fourth quarter. Kevin Sorensen led 15 Blue Devils in scoring with 25 points. Forest Ryan's 12 points topped Valley Christian (6-10).Smith worked as an assistant to Davis coach Dan Gonzalez last season when the Blue Devils made the transition to The System and finished a respectable 14-12.This season, Smith has helped Valley Christian coach Brad Gunter Jr. run two practices, attended several games and even addressed the Lions on Thursday after they beat Sacramento Adventist 97-53.While Gunter had no expectations of upsetting Davis, he had hoped to be more competitive, despite the obvious differences in size and quickness between the players on the two teams.""It might have been too big a stage and too early for us,"" said Gunter, also the school's athletic director and baseball coach. ""But I know (the players) are grateful for the opportunity.""Gonzalez said he didn't expect a school-record scoring effort, especially after Friday's 96-91 overtime win over Monterey Trail.""I was a little nervous because we hadn't played a team that was System-like,"" Gonzalez said. ""I thought (Valley Christian) did fine. But we obviously have more to draw from to outfit our team.""Different reasons led Gunter and Gonzalez to make the changes to their schemes.Gunter, whose team has been to the Division V semifinals twice in three seasons, wanted a scheme where everyone on his 15-man team can play without compromising the Lions' hopes of being a section title challenger.Gonzalez said the Blue Devils weren't cutting it in their former methodical style. They had six losing seasons in seven years before the change.Davis, which won its only section title in 1995, is closing in on its third postseason trip in eight seasons.""I have fun coaching it, and the players enjoy it,"" Gonzalez said. ""I see it as a win-win."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/03/05/5235704/often-an-adult-cats-the-right.html,"Even though my pets, from dogs to goats to horses, generally get along with others not of their kind, I believe most animals like having a companion of their own species. That's why I keep at least two of almost every type of pet I have, and why, three months ago, I added a cat. Not a kitten  a cat. I thought my middle-aged indoor cat, Ilario, seemed lonely after my other cat died. And while kittens are always appealing, I knew that many wonderful adult cats need homes. I had one opening and wanted to fill it with a middle-aged cat.Enter Mariposa.Within a month, I knew I'd made the right decision in adopting her. An adult cat can slide quickly into your life. You know pretty well what you're getting with a grown cat  activity level, sociability, health, etc. Given time in a loving environment, a grown cat forms just as tight a bond with its new people as any kitten can.If you're thinking of adopting a kitten, I encourage you to think adult cat instead. (Or better yet: one of each!) Because adult cats are generally more reserved than kittens, you need to cut them some slack in the adoption process. Then give them plenty of time to adjust to their new home. Mariposa spent the first two weeks alone in a closed spare bedroom, secluded away from Ilario and the dogs to give her time to adjust to the upheaval. When I went in to feed or clean the litter box, I sat quietly on the bed, letting her choose how much she cared to interact.For the first few days, all I saw of her was the flash of her tail as she slid under the bed. When she started greeting me by purring and jumping up beside me to be petted, I moved to the next stage, putting a baby gate across the open doorway. After a few days and some hissy interactions, the two cats were happily sharing the sunny spot in the spare bedroom. But while Ilario came and went over the baby gate, Mariposa did not. She felt safer with the dogs on the other side of the gate, and I didn't push it.Another couple weeks went by before she felt brave enough to explore a little more. My dogs are not cat- aggressive. If they were, I'd never risk having a cat in the home. But they are naturally curious, so I kept a close eye on interactions. After a few sniffs and one aborted chase that ended with Mariposa flying over the baby gate to safety  my dogs know the ""leave it"" command very well  everyone decided to get along. Each week they seem to get along better. I made it easy, of course, with three litter boxes (experts advise one per cat, plus one) and separate feedings for everyone. Two cat trees at opposite ends of the house offer places for togetherness or quiet time alone. Not that either cat is often alone: As I'd guessed he would, Ilario loves having another cat in the home.My biggest challenge now? Finding space on the bed. With two cats and two dogs, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of room left. Mariposa, for her part, sleeps on top of me. That's going to be uncomfortable in the summer, but on these cold evenings I have to admit: It makes me even happier for adopting her than I ever would have dreamed possible."\u000a

V"In a sweeping crackdown on tax return fraud, the Internal Revenue Service this week announced arrests of nearly 110 individuals in 32 states, including three in Sacramento.The IRS dragnet is part of beefed-up efforts to halt an increase in tax return cheaters, who use stolen Social Security numbers to file phony returns, collecting thousands of dollars in refunds in someone else's name.The IRS provided only limited details of the local arrests. The three Sacramento residents  Tammy Lee, Heather Moses and Mandy Rice  were arraigned last week on felony charges of filing multiple ""false, fictitious and fraudulent"" returns.According to the IRS, the three filed anywhere from 12 to 18 phony returns each, mostly between 2009 and 2011. Those returns resulted in tax refunds that ranged from $3,400 to $7,400 apiece.All three pleaded not guilty and were released on bail.If convicted, they face up to five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines, plus $100 penalties per count.""You will definitely see more cases like these coming out of our Sacramento office,"" said Arlette Lee, IRS special agent for criminal investigations, based in Oakland. Tax return fraud ""is a problem and it's reflected in the very large sweep we saw in many areas of the country"" this week, she said.In some cases, fraudsters use Social Security numbers of deceased people to file phony tax returns. In other instances, they use stolen identities  such as a Tennessee case where a woman took information from a stolen Memphis Police Department arrest warrant book. She was sentenced in December to about 22 years in prison and ordered to pay $690,000 in restitution. ""Ultimately, when you have people getting refunds they're not entitled to, it's stealing from the government,"" said IRS agent Lee. ""It affects everybody.""The IRS crackdown is operating on several fronts. The agency tripled the number of identity theft criminal investigations in the last fiscal year, bringing the number of cases to nearly 900. The number of convictions and length of jail time also increased.It also has assigned more than 3,000 agents to identity theft and tax refund fraud, double the number in 2011.Last month, IRS agents also visited 197 check-cashing outlets to ensure they weren't abetting tax refund fraud when handling checks. Those visits targeted 17 cities, including Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Los Angeles. In addition, the IRS has beefed up its computer systems, using more elaborate filters designed to detect tax return fraud. It says those efforts helped protect against $20 billion of fraudulent refunds."\u000a

V"John Heffernan's glow Friday night following his team's 10-0 regular season dimmed a bit Saturday afternoon.The Burbank High School football coach learned the Titans' opponent in the first round of the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I playoffs: Grant, the team Burbank beat 36-27 in a Week 2 thriller but not the same Pacers who stormed into the postseason.Grant has new life after a trying season under veteran coach Mike Alberghini, who maintained that if the Pacers got into the D-I field, they could make a title run. Burbank is seeded second behind Franklin; Grant is 15th at 5-5.""I was definitely surprised because you can't tell me that Grant isn't better than some of the other D-I playoff teams who are 5-5 or 6-4,"" Heffernan said. ""I don't know. But I know our kids are excited, and we're definitely happy Grant is in the playoffs.""There's a brotherhood between the programs and the coaches with the utmost respect and admiration. We root for them like they root for us because we're so similar, from the demographics to the struggles we have.""Still, for all the rapport between the programs, Sacramento City Unified School District officials moved the Friday night kickoff to Saturday at 1 p.m. at Titans Stadium on Florin Road. The reason is safety, with the perception that a night game featuring these teams is more difficult to police than a day affair.Heffernan said he and Alberghini agree it is not their players or the fans who cause trouble. It's outside influences.When Burbank hosted Grant on Sept. 7, the contest went without incident on the field, but a fight between teenage girls in the parking lot after the game spilled into the street. On Sept. 28, following Burbank's home victory over Sacramento, a gunshot blocks away prompted the district to move the Titans' last two home games to 5 p.m.""The district wants to be proactive on safety, and Sacramento Police Department officers are trying to make sure these games are safe,"" Heffernan said. ""I don't really like it, but at least we have a home game, and Saturday home games when I grew up in the Bay Area were special.""People need to know it's never our students or Grant's students or anything like that that cause trouble. It's the hanger-ons, the kids with nothing better to do than create problems.""Tight-knit grouping  This is how tightly bunched the D-I field is: Franklin held off Grant in the closing seconds in a Delta Valley Conference game. Despite beating Grant in Week 1, Nevada Union gained a No. 16 seed and will play Franklin, with the Miners looming as another dangerous 5-5 draw. Franklin beat NU in a playoff opener last season in Grass Valley.Strange seeding  In another seeding curiosity, Rocklin (5-5) gained a No. 13 spot in D-II despite losing its regular-season finale at Del Oro (5-5), seeded 15th.The 38-35 win over Rocklin allowed Del Oro to lock up second place behind Granite Bay, the defending D-I champion. But Rocklin's opponents totaled 60 wins compared with 59 for Del Oro's opponents, which favored the Thunder in the tiebreaker criteria by the section seeding committee.Regardless, Del Oro and Rocklin have a tough road ahead. Rocklin plays at No. 4 Antelope, fresh off a stirring 35-27 win at Whitney to win the Capital Athletic League, and Del Oro visits No. 2 Yuba City, coming off its first league championship since 1987.Herd seeded third  Yuba City drew its No. 2 seed in D-II over No. 3 Elk Grove, which lost only to Franklin 17-7. In short, Yuba City's lone loss, 42-33 to D-IV top seed Placer, carried more weight than Elk Grove's setback to the D-I top seed.Punt patrol  Folsom, top-seeded in D-II with its first 10-0 regular season since 1990, has punted only four times this season. The Bulldogs never stop pushing the tempo.""It makes me physically sick when we have to punt,"" Folsom co-coach Troy Taylor joked."\u000a

The junior is batting .365 with six doubles and 23 RBIs in 36 starts for the Bruins (27-10, 11-7 Pacific-12 Conference). Keefer is one of six players featured on the team's 2012 media guide cover. In a 9-3 win over UC Irvine on Tuesday, the 6-foot-1, 195-pound left fielder was 2 for 4 with a run scored. In Friday's 4-0 win at Oregon State, he had two hits and two RBIs. He's batting .325 in 139 career games for the Bruins. He has started 137 games. ""Cody has been an everyday player for us since he stepped on campus,"" UCLA coach John Savage said by telephone. ""He's meant a lot to our program. We knew he was going to be a good player, and he's going to be a good pro player, too."" Last summer, Keefer batted .280 with three homers and 17 RBIs in the Cape Cod League. He represented his team in the league's All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Keefer started 58 games in left field for the Bruins last season. His .303 batting average was second on the team, while his .408 on-base percentage led the Bruins. He was an all-Pac-10 honorable mention. He batted .285 in the Bruins' four NCAA Regional games and had a team-best .444 on-base percentage. Keefer, whose father, Kevin, played baseball at Davis, batted .318 in 43 starts as a UCLA freshman left fielder with 31 RBIs and a team-best .450 on-base percentage. As a Davis senior, Keefer batted .440 for the 20-8 Blue Devils in 2009. He had 27 RBIs and a team-high five homers and 39 runs scored. His .714 slugging percentage and 14 stolen bases were also team-highs. He was drafted that June in the 33rd round by the Detroit Tigers. Jeff Caraska"\u000a

V"Luis Bravo was a gung-ho freshman who couldn't wait to play high school soccer when he arrived at Encina in the fall of 2004.""I remember coming out to a practice and there were six guys, and two coaches watching them kick the ball around,"" Bravo said. ""There were barely enough players on game day to even have a team. I didn't keep playing that season. It wasn't worth it.""But when John Buchmiller and Glenda Claremon took over as boys soccer coaches a year later, Bravo could sense a change was about to take place.Although Bravo, a three-year captain, played on teams that won only a handful of games, he saw progress every season.Where there once had been a revolving door of coaches, Buchmiller and Claremon stayed the course. Where there once were poor attitudes and selfish behavior, there was respect and more of a willingness to play together.""They got me thinking in a completely different way about soccer,"" Bravo said. ""Before, when I played, it was dog-eat-dog, all individual. It was only about winning. They taught me how to play with character and be respectful toward the game.""Now Bravo is Claremon's assistant (Buchmiller left Encina to teach and coach boys soccer at Mira Loma this year), and the Bulldogs are one of the area's top small-school powers.This afternoon they begin their quest to do what no other area boys soccer team has done in section history  win a fourth consecutive section title  when they host Millennium of Tracy at 3 p.m. in the Division VI quarterfinals.While Encina once struggled to field a team, the Arden-area school of 621 students now has 45 players and varsity and junior varsity teams.The varsity team is reflective of the school's diverse student body, with nimble dribblers, shooters and defenders from Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Mexico and Central America.Many come from economically challenged families, and a few barely speak English because they've recently arrived in the United States.""Even though we come from all over the world, we're really close, like a family,"" said senior co-captain Kevin Velazquez, who has been on Encina's three championship teams. ""We hang out with each other on and off the field. We're like brothers.""Claremon, a grandmother and attorney with four grown children, got her start coaching her kids in the Sierra Oaks Soccer Club. She later coached boys and girls soccer at Rio Americano, a school where most players have high-level club experience.Encina is different, with only a handful of players having club experience. Most learned the game playing on the streets, in the parks or in ethnic leagues.""It's five miles and a world apart,"" Claremon said of Encina and Rio Americano. ""A lot of players come to Encina with remarkable individual skills but no clue how to play as a team. That's why having a JV program has been so huge. You put a 14-year-old on varsity who isn't ready, and you can ruin his confidence.""Encina's confidence was shaken a little this season.Unlike last year, when the Bulldogs won the Sierra Delta League title en route to a 1-0 win over Vacaville Christian in the Division VI section final, the Bulldogs went 9-7-1 overall and finished second to Highlands in league, though they beat the Scots 2-0 in the last regular-season game Oct. 23.""Talent-wise, this is the best team we have had at Encina,"" Claremon said. ""They're wonderful kids. But at times we have not played to our potential. There's been a spark missing.""Claremon hopes Velazquez and Juan ""Juancho"" Duarte will spark the Bulldogs in the postseason. She considers the diminutive Duarte a special player, as good in his own way as arguably the Bulldogs' greatest player, Miguel Aguilar, now on scholarship at USF.""You can't compare John Stockton to Shaq, can you?"" Claremon asks. ""They're really two different players. But Juancho can do some amazing things with the ball. He's my X-factor. He can play anywhere.""Velazquez is her steadying force.""Kevin's a smart player who really controls the ball,"" Claremon said. ""So he's been running the team this year in the midfield.""In 2009 as freshmen, Duarte and Velazquez were brought up to the varsity in the postseason and were part of Encina's first and most improbable section title.The Bulldogs trailed favored Capital Christian 1-0 with just seconds to play in stoppage time when Aguilar hit a sizzling 20-yard blast just off the goalie's fingertips to tie the score. He then volleyed in the jaw-dropping game winner in the second overtime.Capital Christian, which won last year's Division V title after finishing second the year before, is back in Division VI this season. The Cougars are the top seed. Encina is No. 3.Velazquez, who has a 3.5 grade-point average and hopes to become an engineer, said he spent much of the fall thinking about what another championship might mean for his school.""It would be good, and it's important because we don't have the best reputation,"" Velazquez said. ""You'll hear people say it's a bad school with bad kids.""That's just not true. There are a lot of cool kids, good kids here. Winning another championship will show people that there is good stuff happening at Encina."""\u000a

No such worries now. The Saint Mary's College junior pitcher out of Jesuit High School was picked by the Giants in the second round of Tuesday's major league first-year player draft, the highest local player selected.""I was joking with family that I can't be a Dodger  no way,"" Agosta said in relief as he laughed Tuesday afternoon. ""It's hard to put in words what this means. It's awesome. I didn't even talk to the Giants that much leading into the draft, but wow. I'm so happy for my parents, too. They're die-hard Giants fans, and they know how much I love Tim Lincecum.""Jesuit shortstop Zach Green was picked in the third round by the Philadelphia Phillies.The highest selected local player in the 2011 draft, catcher Andrew Susac, also went to the Giants. Susac, out of Jesuit and Oregon State, caught Agosta in high school.""I got a text from Andrew, and he's excited, too,"" Agosta said.The 6-foot-1, 190-pound Agosta (9-2, 2.18 ERA) struck out 95 for Saint Mary's this spring. He led the West Coast Conference in victories and was the Gaels' first nine-game winner since 1991. Agosta went 5-1 his senior year at Jesuit in 2009. His poise caught the eye of Gaels coach Jedd Soto.""Marty got better every time he pitched and never gave in to adversity,"" Soto said in a statement. ""He has been great for us and should do very well for the Giants organization at every level.""Agosta can either choose to return to Moraga for his senior season or sign with the Giants. The enthusiasm in his voice seemed to suggest he is eager to sign.""There will be negotiations, but for a day or so, I'm going to enjoy this,"" he said.The 6-3, 195-pound Green is known for his power at the plate as well as his defense. Green, who batted .417 for Jesuit, had scouts visiting his home for months to gauge his signing interest. Green has verbally committed to Oregon State.""It's a big decision and it should happen soon, and I'll go with my gut feeling,"" he said of OSU or signing.Green said he worked hard to put himself in this position.""You can never be satisfied,"" he said. ""Keep grinding, keep improving. It's a real 'wow' feeling. I knew this day was coming and I was hoping for the best.""Pitcher Justin Haley of Bella Vista, Sierra College and Fresno State was drafted in the sixth round by the Boston Red Sox.Davis High pitcher Ben Eckels was an 11th-round pick by the Arizona Diamondbacks.

V"The city of Elk Grove moved closer to a costly special election after the City Council on Wednesday night failed to break a series of deadlocks on who should fill the council's District 4 vacancy.The council has one more opportunity, at its meeting Jan. 23, to overcome the multiple tie votes and name one of five remaining candidates to replace former Councilman Gary Davis, who was elected mayor.A sixth candidate, Jeffrey Sherwood Owen, a 12-year resident of the city, announced late in the meeting he was withdrawing his application.""I was hoping to get one round of ""yes-yes/no-no,"" Owen quipped.Councilman Pat Hume refused to accept the withdrawal, nominating Owen, who then became the fourth candidate to fall short of a majority with a 2-2 vote.Owen subsequently did withdraw. On Thursday he said he considered a special election  if the council can't pick a candidate to appoint  a monetary loss for the city and ""a shame, when there are so many other things we could do with that money.""Sacramento County elections spokesman Brad Buyse said Thursday that special election costs would be upward of $550,000, and the council might be asked to prepay costs.If the council on Jan. 23 calls for a special election, the earliest it could be held is June 4, Buyse said.Of the six candidates questioned by the council Wednesday night, two emerged as favorites.Nine members of the public urged the council to name Nancy De Anda Chaires to the position. Councilman Jim Cooper appointed Chaires to the Elk Grove Planning Commission five years ago and he nominated her on Wednesday night.She is special programs consultant on migrant education for the state Department of Education, and she was the first to be nominated Wednesday night. She drew staunch support from Davis and Cooper.But she drew ""no"" votes from Hume and fellow Councilman Steve Detrick.Hume, in voting no, said ""there seemed to be some sort of pre-ordained process that got tainted along the way.""Hume's remarks alluded to comments Assemblyman Roger Dickinson made last year about Chaires. According to elkgrovenews.net, Dickinson ""implied"" at a campaign event that Chaires was being groomed to fill Davis' council seat if he won election as mayor.""It shouldn't affect her, just because it played out among other people,"" Cooper told Hume. ""She's done nothing. She didn't have anything to do with it. The community likes her. I don't think it's tainted.""On Thursday, Hume said, ""From where I sit it reeked of backroom deals and politics.""He added, however, ""it had nothing to do with her. I've got respect for her.""Chaires said Thursday if residents thought ""there was something inappropriate going on, I would be the first to call for a special election.""Both Hume and Detrick supported Oscar Portillo O'con, who operates a marketing and public relations business and is president of the Elk Grove Rotary.That nomination also produced a 2-2 split, with Davis and Cooper opposed.Detrick pushed for O'con, remarking that the ""No. 1 thing we (council members) need right now is in the business community"" and noted that O'con had the support of the Elk Grove Chamber of Commerce.""I was going after Oscar's support five years ago,"" Detrick recalled of his own election campaign.He said the two traveled together recently to Concepcin de Ataco, Elk Grove's sister city in El Salvador.The only other candidate to be nominated was David Glenn Conner, the chief executive officer for RECON Networking Inc. of Elk Grove  also producing a deadlock.At one point, Mayor Davis looked to the candidates to help sort it out, suggesting that they be given ""time to talk to each other and run two more weeks of a campaign.""Translation: Candidates have two weeks to change council members' minds - and votes - to break the deadlock.If there is a special election, Chaires said Thursday, there could be unintended consequences.""The 4th District might be without representation for six of the next 24 months,"" she said.""What I hadn't realized until last night is that we are also in store for tie votes for the next six months,"" she said. ""Not only is the 4th District going to be affected, but the city as a whole.""Editor's note: This story was changed Jan. 12 to clarify that candidates have two weeks to change council members' minds - and votes - to break the deadlock."\u000a

Based on the life of the woman known as the queen of gospel, Mahalia Jackson, Tom Stolz's musical biodrama leans heavily on the powerfully performed musical part of the equation.With Atlanta-based actress Bernardine Mitchell portraying Jackson and Rene Clark acting as the production's music director and playing pianist Mildred Falls (Jackson's longtime accompanist), the production has easy, engaging charm. Mitchell and Clark have performed the roles together around the country, and their onstage chemistry and timing support their characters' friendship.Mitchell is a dynamic vocalist who rumbles down into the distinctive gritty timbre that Jackson used so effectively to bring the life and spirituality of African American gospel singing to the world in the '40s and '50s.The two women are supported by the versatile locally based actor Anthony D'Juan, who plays several male roles including composer Thomas A. Dorsey (often called the father of gospel music) and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a good friend of Jackson. Keyboardist Willis Hickerson, who has his own impressive rsum, plays Blind Francis, an organist who also worked with Jackson.Director Elisabeth Nunziato nimbly stages the musical as the short, pointed scenes skip through the narrative of Jackson's life. The songs and their electric performances are the key here, with classics such as ""How I Got Over,"" ""Elijah Rock,"" ""I've Been 'Buked,"" and ""Didn't It Rain"" all stoking the receptive audience. Jason Kuykendall created the video projections that helpfully convey the sense of place and time throughout the production.The last shows are 7 p.m. today and Saturday and 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/01/08/5100561/stoppage-time-argentina-remains.html,"What do you get the man who, seemingly, has everything?Lionel Messi scooped up another accolade on Monday, winning his fourth straight FIFA Ballon d'Or, given to the world's most-outstanding player.The award should not come as a surprise given Messi's monumental year.While Barcelona suffered a disappointing campaign that saw the club claim just one trophy (Copa del Rey), Messi was as influential as ever.The Argentine racked up 50 goals in La Liga play throughout the 2011-12 season, averaging an astonishing 1.35 goals per game. Messi's 27 goals in 18 La Liga contests this term puts his scoring rate at an even more blistering pace, and it helped bring his goal tally to 91 goals in 2012, breaking Gerd Muller's record for most goals in a calendar year.In addition to the Ballon d'Or coup, Messi was named to FIFA's FIFPro World XI for the sixth successive year.At the club level, Messi has helped the Catalans win just about every trophy at their disposal.During his time at Barcelona, Messi is a five-time La Liga champion, a five- time Supercopa de Espana champion, a three-time UEFA Champions League winner, a two-time Copa del Rey champion, a two-time UEFA Super Cup champion and a two-time FIFA Club World Cup champion.His track record of success with the Catalans is unparalleled and he is still just 25 years old.Messi basically could retire tomorrow and be regarded as the greatest ever. What more does he have to prove?How about achieving success with his country?Despite all of the individual accolades and team titles won with Barcelona, there remains a gaping hole in Messi's resume.With only a FIFA U-20 World Cup triumph in 2005 and an Olympic gold medal in 2008 to his name, Messi's successes with Argentina are few and far between.His scoring record with Argentina is considerably lower than with Barcelona, managing 31 goals (more than half of which have come in friendly matches) in 76 appearances.While he is not the only culprit, Messi's futility in competitive matches has seen Argentina come up short in several recent major tournaments.His only goal in World Cup play came in garbage time of a 6-0 rout of Serbia and Montenegro in the group stage of the 2006 tournament. He entered the 2010 event as one of the stars of the tournament but did not produce a single goal, playing a minor role as Argentina fizzled out of the competition in the quarterfinals.In Copa America play, Messi has fallen short on two occasions. Argentina looked prime for victory in 2007 only to lose to Brazil, 3-0, in the final, while the 2011 edition of the tournament proved to be an abomination for ""La Albiceleste"" as the nation was ousted by Uruguay in the quarterfinals.It is not as if Argentina has had a poor supporting cast, either. Messi should have been feasting off of the service and combination play offered by Gonzalo Higuain, Carlos Tevez, Angel di Maria and Maxi Rodriguez.Messi is not the type to be concerned with the kind of legacy he leaves, often deflecting questions about where he ranks himself in the pantheon of great footballers over the years. And while many already rate him as the best ever, the Argentine needs a defining moment in a major tournament to be compared to the likes of Pele.It is highly unlikely that Messi can match Pele's three World Cup crowns or surpass Ronaldo's 15 goals in World Cup play, but he needs something tangible at the international level to validate his career beyond Barcelona. It can come in the form of a World Cup victory and Copa America triumph the following year, or even as a World Cup scoring title in a deep run to the final. Just, something.The 2014 World Cup in Brazil may be Messi's best chance to write his legacy with Argentina.He will be in the prime of his career for the tournament, entering the competition at 26 and leaving it at 27, and it will take place on his home continent. It is worth noting that Argentina has not had to travel far for its World Cup titles, winning on home soil in 1978 before its memorable victory in 1986, led by Maradona, in Mexico.For a man who has experienced nothing but success with Barcelona, Messi certainly should be targeting the final frontier in a career littered with prizes: World Cup victory for Argentina in 2014."\u000a

V"WASHINGTON  Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Tuesday defended his agency's changes in the year after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, dismissing criticism of a lengthier and more extensive permitting process as mere Washington noise. Appearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Salazar stressed that the U.S. is committed to offshore oil and gas development when it's done safely. A plan to streamline the permitting process, championed by Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, got the backing last week of President Barack Obama, who called Saturday in his weekly radio address for easing the way for more domestic oil and gas production, particularly in the offshore Arctic and National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Begich and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are pushing for increased offshore production in the Arctic as a source of oil that will keep the trans-Alaska pipeline running. Alaska's senators have been meeting repeatedly with the president and White House officials in recent months to find ways to cut through red tape to move projects forward in the state. The past year has been evidence that (streamlining the permitting process) is needed now more than ever, Begich told the committee Tuesday. I was glad to hear the president talking about ... the need to coordinate between the many different federal agencies. Murkowski told Salazar that she remains concerned that the U.S. is about one-third of the way toward the levels in new exploration and production that existed when the administration imposed an offshore drilling moratorium after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20, 2010, and the subsequent oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico. It should be our goal to ensure our offshore industry is working safely, she said. But that requires that it be working. But Salazar pointed out that until a few months ago, he and the director of the new agency that oversees offshore drilling, Michael Bromwich, weren't confident in the well-containment systems being developed by oil companies. When they were confident, they started issuing permits again, Bromwich said. Since then, permits for 14 deepwater wells have been issued. Another 53 have been granted in shallow waters since last June, Bromwich said.  We couldn't really grant deepwater permits until there was containment capability, said Bromwich, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. That didn't happen until February. The notion that it's taken us a very long time to permit deepwater applications is really not true. Both men also took issue with legislation passed by the Republican-led House of Representatives and being considered by the Senate that shortens the time that federal regulators have to consider applications to drill. That legislation, Salazar said, would pull out the rug from what it is we're trying to do: safe development of oil and gas in America's oceans. That doesn't mean the transparency of the process  keeping applicants informed of the status of their permits  can't be improved, Bromwich said. But oil companies also must recognize that there's a new regulatory regime, Salazar said. Although he told the committee his department has a good relationship with industry, it doesn't mean we should be dictated to about standards, a reference to accusations that before the Deepwater Horizon disaster, oil and gas interests were too cozy with the Interior Department's old Minerals Management Service. Obviously, there's tremendous expertise that we listen to, he said of industry advisory groups. But at the end of the day, it's our independent judgment that has to come to bear on these recommendations.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/09/28/4862127/rivals-to-meet-after-infamous.html,"The low point of the 2011 high school football season in Sacramento was the brawl between decades-long rivals Kennedy and McClatchy.With McClatchy leading 14-0 in the fourth quarter of a Metro Conference game in Greenhaven in front of a large crowd, a Lion was gang-tackled. One overzealous Kennedy defender continued to drive the player into the ground after the whistle. Then mayhem. Players had to be pulled off each other. The game did not continue.Footage of the game went viral. The schools best known for their sterling academic reputations made national news for the wrong reasons. The Sacramento City Unified School District handed down player suspensions and game forfeitures to both programs. Tonight at 7:15, the teams face off again, this time at Hughes Stadium, McClatchy's home field.In an effort to foster sportsmanship and goodwill, coaches and captains from both squads have met three times since the fight, including Thursday for lunch.Kennedy went 0-10 last season and is 0-4 this fall under first-year coach Matt Costa, who has vowed that his team will not reduce itself by fighting. Malcolm Floyd is back this season as the coach at McClatchy (1-3), his alma mater.""I have two views etched in my memory from the game last year,"" Floyd said. ""First is the swinging of helmets during the chaos on the field as (assistant coach) Tony Whitehead and I run to separate the teams.""Second is the demeanor of our team on film. I can see order on our sideline with coaches keeping the players calm. It wasn't a good night. Coach Costa and I know each other, and (all is good). This will be a good game, an excellent game if we can all go home healthy and happy.""Dragons uprising  Sacramento hasn't fielded a team this prolific or talented since its 9-1 team of 1992 under then-coach Tom Rutten.This year's Dragons (3-1) under seventh-year coach Paul Doherty offer speed and experience, including quarterback Josiah Johnson and three-year starting linemen Ian Howerton and Demetrius Watts. Doherty said sophomore linebacker Lonny Powell ""could wind up in the NFL. Amazing talent.""Sacramento opens Metro Conference play tonight at No. 3 Burbank (4-0).More speed  Del Oro, the defending Sac-Joaquin Section Division III champion, continues its brutal early schedule against NorCal No. 3 Logan of Union City, which invades Loomis for an intersectional contest. The Colts (5-0) are fast on offense and unyielding on defense, with their starters allowing two touchdowns all season.Injuries have left Del Oro (0-4) to rely on fourth-string tailback Dylan Kainrath, who ran for 161 yards and three touchdowns on 36 carries in a 31-30 loss at Grant on Friday. Del Oro also lost to Oaks Christian (40-0), Westlake (16-13) and Burbank (28-23).""We're still grinding,"" Golden Eagles coach Casey Taylor said."\u000a

V"There might come a day when Vacaville plays Folsom in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division II football playoff game and not have to worry about a quarterback carving it to bits.But it won't be today.For a third consecutive postseason, Vacaville is bracing to play another top-notch quarterback in a 7 p.m. section quarterfinal at Folsom, this time it is sophomore Jake Browning, who has a state-best 50 touchdown passes. He has passed for 4,147 yards, mostly to Phillip Carter, Troy Knox and Lucas Owan.Vacaville certainly remembers Browning's predecessors.In 2010, under a sheet of rain, Folsom's Dano Graves passed for 327 yards and five touchdowns and ran for 51 yards and three more scores  all in the first half  in a 75-6 rout. Folsom went on to win the CIF State D-II championship and Graves the MaxPreps National Player of the Year honor. He's now at the Air Force Academy.In last season's D-II championship game, record-setting quarterback Tanner Trosin passed for 407 yards and four touchdowns, including a 99-yarder, and ran for 101 and one touchdown. But Vacaville outlasted Trosin and Folsom 39-35 for its second section title, capping a 13-1 season. Now at Cal Poly, Trosin set state prep records and became the first quarterback to amass 6,000 total yards in a season.Now it's Browning's turn.""They have another great one,"" Vacaville coach Mike Papadopoulos said.Troy Taylor agrees. The Folsom co-coach and offensive coordinator has worked closely with the 6-foot-2 quarterback since Browning was in the fifth grade.""Jake's incredible,"" said Taylor, a former NFL quarterback. ""He's unfazed, very composed, has great anticipation. He avoids sacks, fits the ball in tight windows and has an extremely quick release. There's not a better player at any position in the section, and for us, if our quarterback doesn't play well, it's tough. Everything goes through him. He holds the team in the palm of his hands.""Taylor said a physical, bright offensive line, tutored by co-coach Kris Richardson, has allowed Browning time to pick apart defenses.""I'm very impressed with Jake,"" Folsom senior lineman Josh Wormley said. ""He's very poised, very good.""Taylor said Browning has instincts and the ""it"" factor, too.""We tell Jake not to get too high or too low, and to shake it off if he has a bad play because (he'll) throw it another 45 times,"" Taylor said, adding that Browning's dedication to the game makes him special. ""Jake spends every lunch hour in my office, going over film. Every waking moment, he's preparing. Everyone else is out at lunch, with the girls, and he's relentless in his pursuit of perfection."""\u000a

V"""The Greatest Show on Turf"" ran headlong into ""The Green Machine"" on Saturday night at Hornet Stadium.The green guys won emphatically, leaving a black-and-blue reminder at what another level of football looks and feels like.De La Salle High School flexed its considerable muscle in offering an announced crowd of 10,197 a glimpse of precisely what makes for a football dynasty with no comparison. The nationally renowned Spartans of Concord exploded off the line of scrimmage on offense, relentlessly chased ballcarriers on defense and rolled Folsom 49-15 in the first Northern California Regional Open game.There's certainly no shame in losing to an outfit bearing this sort of pedigree, Folsom coaches said afterward as the Bulldogs' season came to a grinding halt at 14-1. Folsom will chalk this up to a learning experience. De La Salle  or De La Stomp as the Spartans have become best known  has habitually driven even the most formidable teams into the turf for decades, and the Spartans did so against a state-ranked No. 3 Folsom group that came in averaging 48 points. State No. 1 De La Salle (14-0) extended its unbeaten streak against NorCal foes to 238 games since 1991.Since 1984, the Spartans have gone an unfathomable 318-5-2 against NorCal teams in pretty much putting a stamp on the art of execution, simplicity with the veer running game and overall effort.And lifetime under famed coach Bob Ladouceur since 1979, De La Salle improved to 5-0 against Sacramento-area teams and 32-0 against Sac-Joaquin Section competition.So the Spartans will head back to Carson next weekend in an attempt to four-peat in the CIF Open Bowl and secure the program's 18th end-of-season state No. 1 finish by Cal-Hi Sports since 1987.The Spartans left little doubt from the start in churning out methodical drives. Tiapepe Vitale scored on a three-yard run to cap his team's first drive. His one-yard score with 45 seconds left in the half produced a 28-7 lead, and his six-yard run in the third made it 35-7. He rushed for 117 yards, and backfield mate Das Tautalatasi went for 94. Folsom, with a young roster and scores of talent on the lower levels, collectively promises to regroup. Bulldogs quarterback Jake Browning threw for 282 yards on 38-of-64 passing and broke the state's single-season passing mark with 5,246 yards, eclipsing Tanner Trosin's total of 5,185 for Folsom set last season.Browning also passed for two touchdowns, giving him 63 this season, one shy of the state record set by Robert De La Cruz of Cathedral-Los Angeles in 1999.But Browning was sacked six times, all in the first half. Remarkably, De La Salle rushed only four players, but a Folsom line that had won the line-of-scrimmage tussle in the season's first 14 weeks met its match.Browning, just a sophomore, was intercepted three times. He had little time to set up partly because he hasn't faced a team this fast and star-studded with a national recruit defensive end in Austin Hooper (he has 18 major-college offers) and USC-commit linebacker Michael Hutchings.""He's good, and they pushed us a few times, but we didn't break,"" Ladouceur said.Folsom coaches Troy Taylor and Kris Richarson said the plan was to the maintain the same sort of demeanor and approach to this game as any other, even though everyone knew this was a game unlike no other.""They're so good,"" Taylor said of De La Salle. ""It's the best tackling team I've ever seen.""Folsom assistant coach Bobby Fresques has known De La Salle defensive coordinator Terry Eidson for years. He said of the Spartans, who cleared the bench in the fourth quarter with a 42-7 lead, ""You can see why they're such a great program, and they do things the right way."""\u000a

V"Sheldon High School impressively cruised past area power Antelope and defending CIF NorCal Division III boys basketball champion Sacred Heart Cathedral of San Francisco in last weekend's Valley-CRC Summer Challenge.Granted, it's summer hoops, and most teams don't have all their pieces for various reasons.But even with three key players out with injuries, including returning Bee Player of the Year D'Erryl Williams, Sheldon was on cruise control for most of the tournament, including its 66-49 victory over Sacred Heart Cathedral in the title game at Cosumnes River College. Plenty of credit for that goes to senior guard-wing Dakarai Allen.A four-year varsity performer, the long and lean Allen set the tone with his marvelous all-around play, grit and leadership.The 6-foot-5 Allen sees himself as a mentor to the younger players, especially freshman varsity hopefuls Devin Greene and Ian Miller, and very much wants to lead the Huskies to an unprecedented Sac-Joaquin Section Division I four-peat and a return trip to the CIF state D-I final.Allen remembers being in Greene's and Miller's hightops four years ago as a wide-eyed role player to then-Sheldon stars Darius Nelson and Ramon Eaton.""I keep after them,"" Allen said of Greene and Miller. ""I want to hold them accountable and to maintain the Sheldon legacy just as Darius Nelson and Ramon Eaton trained me.""Allen already has a half-dozen scholarship offers, including from San Diego State, Saint Mary's and Colorado. He expects to get more offers as he performs later this summer in major national Amateur Athletic Union tournaments with his Play Hard, Play Smart club team.Allen, rated the sixth-best senior in Northern California by NorCalPreps.com, has built his reputation on his defensive abilities and is a terrific player in the open court and slashing to the basket.Recruiters are considering whether he can score outside consistently, something Sheldon coach Joey Rollings doesn't question.""He's got a good shot, but a lot of times he chooses not to shoot, instead looking to pass and to make assists,"" Rollings said.One thing is certain. Few players will outwork Allen. While playing for Sheldon and Play Hard, Play Smart, Allen often trains up to six hours a day. He credits Ron Nelson, the father of Darius and ex-Duke standout DeMarcus Nelson, for keeping him motivated to improve.""It gets real tiring, but if I'm not at a workout, coach Ron will be calling me to see if I'm needing a ride,"" said Allen, a Bee All-Metro first-team selection last season who averaged 14 points, seven rebounds and three assists. ""It's hard to get out of bed sometimes, but this is my life.""Olympic-bound  Former Granite Bay High swimmer Haley Anderson, now at USC, has qualified for the London Olympics after winning the women's 10K title at the FINA Olympic Marathon Swim Qualifier on Saturday in Setubal, Portugal.Swimming for the United States, Anderson finished in 1 hour, 44 minutes, 30.6 seconds to beat second-place Eva Risztov of Hungary by 1.4 seconds.Saturday proved a big day for the Anderson sisters as Haley's older sister, Alyssa, won the 200-meter freestyle at the Mutual of Omaha (Neb.)

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/01/31/5153825/in-surprise-move-vietnam-releases.html,"In a stunning reversal of course Wednesday, the Vietnamese government freed Elk Grove pro-democracy activist Nguyen Quoc Quan after nine months in prison and deported him to California.He arrived in Los Angeles on Wednesday evening.Ever since Nguyen's Jan. 22 subversion trial in Vietnam was postponed indefinitely, his wife, Ngo Mai Huong, feared for his life. The Vietnamese government had recently sentenced 13 other pro-democracy activists to prison terms ranging from three to 12 years on similar charges.Nguyen, 59, was arrested last April at Ho Chi Minh Airport for allegedly plotting the nonviolent overthrow of the Vietnamese government.On Wednesday, Ngo got a call at her mother's home in Los Angeles from Ted Coley, an official at the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.""The whole night I couldn't sleep, and Mr. Coley told me, 'You better sit down.'""Then he told me Quan was on an airplane to Taipei, Taiwan,' "" said a deliriously excited Ngo. ""There was no trial at all.""Two hours later, Nguyen called her from Taipei. ""I cried right away, I keep jumping up and down, and he's laughing,"" she said. ""He said, 'I'm very strong, very healthy and people around me tell me I look very young.'""Then he read a poem for me that said, while in jail he'd think of me, I am his freedom, nobody can fight for freedom if his wife didn't support him,"" Ngo said. ""He said he's married to freedom and his country. His whole life, he thinks about the people in Vietnam.""Nguyen, a veteran activist who has promoted nonviolent change in the spirit of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi for years, flew into Los Angeles International Airport.About 100 friends, relatives and supporters were scheduled to meet him, said Diem Do, the San Jose-based chairman of Viet Tan, the International Vietnamese Reform Party, branded a terrorist organization by the government of Vietnam. It has strong support in Sacramento.Despite the intensified crackdown on bloggers and activists advocating nonviolent change, Nguyen's sudden release could signal a change in the communist nation, Do said.""I think the Vietnamese government realizes the pro-democracy movement's gaining strength and people are a lot more vocal in demanding political reforms,"" he said. ""On top of that they are facing an economic crisis, and the top two party officials are accusing each other of corruption.""With the release of Nguyen  who had received support from the U.S. Congress, State Department, European Union and international human rights organizations  Do said he's hopeful the momentum is ""swinging to our side and we will see meaningful, concrete changes in the not-too-distant future.""The Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security said that under the implementation of the government's ""humanitarian policy,"" Nguyen, 59, was expelled for his participation in the ""exile reactionary organization Viet Tan.""Last April 17, Nguyen was arrested at Ho Chi Minh airport before he even cleared customs for ""activities aimed at overthrowing the people's administration,"" the Vietnamese News Service said.They added that Nguyen ""had confessed his offense,"" asked for leniency and was allowed to return to California to be reunited with his wife and two sons.""But Quan said he'd never confessed,"" his wife said. If he had confessed, he would have been released a long time ago, added his lawyer, Linda Malone, a professor at William and Mary Law School in Virginia.""It all happened very quickly and secretively,"" Malone said. ""We're extremely relieved,"" especially since there are approximately 20 Vietnamese awaiting trial on charges of trying to overthrow the government through peaceful advocacy.""Malone added, ""The attention you (The Bee) and others brought to this case has without question made a difference. The public outrage and response and the efforts of the State Department are very much responsible for this wonderful outcome.""Nguyen's wife also thanked The Bee, which has covered Nguyen's case since he was first arrested by Vietnamese authorities in 2007 for trying to distribute 7,000 fliers he had written about civil disobedience. ""You helped us a lot,"" she said.After six months in a Vietnamese prison, her husband was convicted of terrorism in 2008, deported and ordered never to return to the country he had escaped by fishing boat in 1981.Reunited with his wife and two sons in Elk Grove, Nguyen told The Bee then he was no terrorist, but admitted he had written the two-page flier, ""Non-Violent Struggle: The Approach to Eradicate Dictatorship, Set the Stage for Democracy.""The flier calls for widespread civil disobedience and urges protesters to ""faithfully maintain the discipline of nonviolence.""On Wednesday, Nguyen's son Khoa Nguyen, a third-year pharmaceutical chemistry student at UC Davis, left school to greet his dad at LAX. ""I'm really stunned, really happy. It came out of nowhere,"" he said. ""I was afraid they were going to keep him for a long time, or execute him. He'll probably just spend a lot of time with my mom and our family."""\u000a

V"A Bay Area bicycle shop has raised $4,000 in reward money in a quest for information about a former employee and Sacramento-area resident who disappeared with her boyfriend a month ago while bicycling in Peru.Jeff Jerge, owner of The Pedaler Bicycle Shop in El Sobrante, said Jamie Neal had worked as a bicycle mechanic at the shop for 2 1/2 years before leaving with her boyfriend, Garrett Hand, on a bicycle trek through South America.Neal, 27, and Hand, 25, were last seen boarding a bus in Cusco, Peru, on Jan. 25. Their friends and families have not heard from them since, said Hand's sister Alena Hand of Sacramento.The two had been posting on Facebook almost daily since arriving in Buenos Aires in late November for the planned four-month trip, Alena Hand said.But since Jan. 25, she said, ""There's been no financial activity, no email activity, no Facebook activity. There's been zero contact.""She said it is out of character for her brother not to stay in contact with his family when traveling.After hearing nothing for two weeks, Alena Hand said her mother contacted the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru. The couple reportedly were seen in Lima on Jan. 26.Jamie Neal's sister, Stacy Fingers of Antelope, said embassy workers told the family there have been reports of other sightings. ""But there's no documentation,"" she said.Fingers said her sister graduated from Elk Grove High School and became interested in bicycling while living in the downtown Sacramento area. She said Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand had been living most recently in Oakland.Concern for their safety is heightened given a Feb. 13 warning by the U.S. Embassy in Lima on its website of a kidnapping threat in the Cusco area.The embassy said it had received word that members of a criminal organization might be planning to kidnap U.S. citizens visiting the Cusco and Machu Picchu areas.Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand are experienced bicyclists. Alena Hand said her brother is a seasoned traveler who spent the past three years working as a commercial fisherman in Alaska.Jerge is asking anyone with information to call him at (510) 589-6644, or email help@theped.com."\u000a

V"The Monterey Trail girls' track and field season appeared to implode 40 yards from the finish line of the 200-meter dash last Friday.Section sprint leader Esther Higgwe was closing in on her second individual title and third overall at the Sac-Joaquin Section Masters championships on an unseasonably cold and windy night.Then she cried out and landed in a heap on the all-weather track at Elk Grove High School. Higgwe's right hamstring had given out.""It was heartbreaking,"" said her coach, Robert Longan. ""She's a huge catalyst for our team.""Teammate A'Jah Love, running next to Higgwe, couldn't believe what had happened.""I heard her scream and go down,"" said Love, a senior who won the race. ""I wanted to stop so bad because she's such a big part of our team.  Winning was kind of bittersweet.""Higgwe said the moment is frozen in her mind.""I'm coming off the curve, I'm about to hit second gear and then I hear a pop, and I scream out in pain,"" the senior said. ""My lasting image is seeing the other seven girls running away from me. That feeling  it killed me.""Opponents who moments before were trying to beat her, rushed back after the race to see if she was OK  something remarkable in what many view as a ""dog-eat-dog"" event.""I didn't notice at the time,"" Higgwe said. ""When others told me it was the most powerful thing they've seen, I was astounded.""But we do maintain a very positive relationship with all the girls we run with. We talk, we laugh, we joke  until we get into the blocks. That's when the seriousness starts.""Higgwe's outgoing, friendly personality is magnetic. She likes to draw, dance and chat. But she's also a remarkable student headed to Cal with big-picture views on life. Her dream is to become a doctor and build a hospital to help those in her native Nigeria, which she left when she was 6.""You don't get to coach too many Esther Higgwes,"" said Longan, a former Woodland High football player and pole vaulter who has coached at Monterey Trail since Higgwe's freshman season. ""She sees life a lot differently than most students her age.""While Higgwe was understandably despondent over her injury, she didn't stay down for long. Her mind, if not yet her body, insists she'll compete in this weekend's CIF State Track and Field Championships at Buchanan High School in Clovis.Despite being on crutches, she hopes a novel physical therapy treatment will enable her to toss aside those implements and race in Friday's trials in the 100 meters (which she won at the Masters) and the 4x100 relay (won by the Mustangs).""I'm just staying really positive right now,"" Higgwe said. ""I don't believe that this is going to stop me.""Before her injury, Higgwe was considered a candidate to reach Saturday's state 100 finals. Her season best of 11.86, run at the Sacramento Meet of Champions on April 28, is 12th best in the state.The Mustangs' 4x100 relay team that Higgwe anchors and includes Love, senior Phoenisha Schuhmeier and sophomore Ciara Levy had yet to run its best race, Longan said, despite being ranked No. 1 in Northern California and No. 7 in the state.""We're trying to show that this little school in Elk Grove can stay up with those amazing runners in Southern California,"" said Love, a Cal Poly signee who also will run the 400 in Clovis.""It must be something in the water down there because they're fast. But I think we're fast, too, especially with Esther.""Higgwe is trying to speed the healing process by reducing inflammation and pain through treatments at a Roseville cryotherapy center.""It's like a super ice bath without getting into a bath of ice,"" she said.In just two minutes and 45 seconds inside a ""cryo chamber,"" Higgwe's body temperature cools by nearly 30 degrees.""It's more effective,"" she said. ""It's like 50 ice baths in one two-minute setting.""Whether Higgwe runs will be a meet-time decision, Longan said. If she can't go, senior middle-distance runner Desiree Turner will take her spot in the relay lineup.""They're making preparations just in case I can't run  that's just being smart,"" Higgwe said. ""But I'm very confident I'm going to run Friday and Saturday. To compete at the state meet has been my goal the whole season.""So I'm not going to let one little injury deter me.""

V"For Cindel Pena, home couldn't come any sooner. The Sacramento resident was one of 4,200 people stuck on the ill-fated Carnival Triumph that for days bobbed listlessly without power in the Gulf of Mexico.On Friday, Pena returned home after a long journey from Mobile, Ala., where the towed 14-story cruise ship finally docked Thursday night.""We were all just dying to jump off the boat,"" Pena said Friday afternoon, after waking up from a long nap.The 893-foot luxury cruise ship departed Galveston, Texas, on Feb. 7 or a four-day voyage. What was supposed to be a college reunion for Pena and her six girlfriends ended up a nightmare. The ordeal started at 5 a.m. Sunday, when an engine-room fire knocked out power to the entire vessel.""They didn't tell us about the fire at first,"" Pena said, recalling the initial confusion. ""The outside world knew more than we did.""Without power, the ship bobbed aimlessly in the open sea. Toilets wouldn't flush and passengers were told to relieve themselves in the shower and in red plastic bags. Immediately after the fire, Pena said, the ship started tilting to one side, because the stabilizer was out.""The sewage started coming out of the drains,"" she said.Other passengers reported similar deplorable conditions, through media reports, text messages and phone calls to loved ones. But Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill rejected some of the accounts, saying at a news conference Tuesday that the company was doing everything possible to improve conditions on board.For several days, food was scarce. Passengers reported lines upward of three hours to get an onion sandwich.""We got one meal a day; otherwise, you'd spend the entire day in line,"" Pena said.Carnival initially planned to tow the vessel to Mexico. By the time tugboats arrived Monday evening, the cruise liner had drifted so far north that the company decided to tow it to Mobile.Other Carnival cruise ships sailed next to the stricken vessel to supply provisions. Passengers eagerly awaited these arrivals so they could use the other ships' cell towers to call home.Starting Tuesday, Pena said, two public bathrooms became operational for the ship's passengers and crew. The sanitary conditions on the vessel grew worse by the day.""All the carpets were squishy. You could smell feces,"" Pena said.Pena and other passengers passed time by walking around the deck, reading books and ""talking about nothing.""Some took their mattresses up on deck, setting up a tent city to escape the sewage and rancid smells from the lower levels.""We were all very angry, but we also didn't have any choice,"" she said. ""We can't jump off the boat. There's no land. There's no help.""Carnival has offered passengers credit toward a future cruise, in addition to a full refund. Cahill came to Mobile on Thursday night to meet passengers, using loudspeakers to apologize for the ordeal.""Our promise to our guests is to provide a very great vacation experience  "" Cahill said at a news conference. ""  Obviously in this particular case, we did not deliver on that promise.""For Pena, Triumph was her second cruise, and she said it will be her last.""I want answers,"" Pena said. ""Why didn't you get us off the ship sooner?"""\u000a

They survived a tough 5-3 outbracket win at Tracy on May 15.So Friday, the players gathered for an impromptu meeting midway through practice.Each player wrote on a few sheets of toilet tissue all their woes from the season.

""He had his game face on.""That's a face the parents are used to. They've watched their son muscle through the trials of his injuries, and now await his release from the military in February.""Getting his legs blown off was just the beginning,"" Cheryl Hotaling said. ""He's had to deal with infections, 20 operations, 2 1/2 months in the hospital and rehabilitation. Now, he will make the transition to civilian life. It's all about the next chapter with him.""When Josh Hotaling zipped by on Fair Oaks Boulevard, he was in the lead, with his family and spectators shouting encouragement.""He looked great,"" his mother said as she and her husband jumped into their truck and hurried to meet him at the finish line at the state Capitol in Sacramento.John Schumacher, media coordinator for the marathon, said hand cyclists typically finish the course ahead of runners. Josh Hotaling crossed the finish line first with a time of 2:13.46, just ahead of the first marathon runner.Hotaling said he trains for marathons by hand-cycling twice a week while rehabbing at the U.S. Navy hospital in San Diego.""I'm a big-time surfer and was a big-time runner, so this is a good way for me to keep in shape and be competitive,"" Hotaling said.Schumacher said the weather was ""pretty gnarly"" for elite runners at the front of the event. They got the brunt of a cloudburst. Still, veteran CIM runners told him the storm of 1987 was worse, he said.""By 11 a.m., the storm had passed and it was dry, so runners in the back of the pack actually had nice conditions,"" he said.The stormy conditions cut down on the number of spectators early in the morning, Schumacher said, and made the race more taxing for volunteers but didn't seem to dampen the spirits of participants.""I'll be looking for the perfect puddle to jump in,"" said Maggie Davis, 38, of Cameron Park, as she waited near the 20-mile mark for her leg of the relay event to begin. ""It's only rain.""Davis was one of 46 runners from the El Dorado Hills Triathlon Club participating in the marathon.""I ran the full distance last year and wanted to shorten it up this year,"" she said. ""With a relay team, there's a lot of motivation. It's about encouraging each other and knowing we're in this together.""Phil Adiarte, 51, of Tracy also was undaunted by the wet weather as he waited to start the last leg of the relay. He ran with his brother and two sisters on Team Grandparent.""We all run, but this is the first time we've run together, so it's going to be fun,"" he said. ""It's a beautiful day.""The weather was not so exhilarating for most of the 2,000 event volunteers. Sarah Larson and son Alex got pelted by rain and blown around by gusts as they filled cups of water just before 8 a.m. at the aid station on Fair Oaks Boulevard near Watt Avenue. The two were part of a group from a local Boy Scout troop.""We'll be here until it's over,"" Larson said. ""Then, we'll go home and defrost."""\u000a

V"It's a gauge game every year, the coaches say, and it's how the teams perform in front of their passionate communities and recover from defeat that makes or breaks a season.Burbank High School on Friday night performed in front of its largest home crowd in the 44-year history on Florin Road within the Sacramento City Unified School District. The swift and active No. 11 Titans appear on the cusp of a breakthrough season after downing the No. 7 Grant Pacers 36-27 before almost 5,000 fans in a nonleague game that suddenly has both programs heading in opposite directions.Burbank (2-0) beat the Pacers (1-2) for the first time since 2007  when the Titans celebrated a late rally in Del Paso Heights for the team's first Metro League championship since the early 1970s. Next for the Titans is a game at the second-winningest program in the last decade at Del Oro in Loomis. Grant, having won more games than any area team in the last 10 seasons, is off to an uncharacteristically slow start, undone partly by the competition and miscues, and will fall out of The Bee's top 10 for the first time since before coach Mike Alberghini became the head coach in 1991.""It's a measuring stick playing Grant  where we are, where we need to go,"" Titans coach John Heffernan said. ""We learn a lot from this game  our kids, the heart. Some years, we're not ready, and this year, we think we're ready.""The Titans were plenty ready. With the triple-option, three-headed attack of quarterback Ernest Jenkins and backs Calvin Green and Isaiah Williams, Burbank more than matched Grant's speed and ferocity. At times, the Titans surpassed it. Williams rushed for 182 yards, including touchdown runs of 13 and 2 yards. Jenkins had scoring runs of 11, 7 and 75 yards, and Green rushed for 72 yards.Grant, coming off a 37-7 loss to Nevada Union, gets no easy break from here, either. It plays at No. 10 Oak Ridge next Friday.Grant players and coaches said they were pleased to see the Titans have a new stadium, all of 1 year old and still sparkling. It replaced the old grass home digs that was a minefield of gopher holes, prompting Heffernan and the Titans to play all their games on the road for four years.On Friday, the place was packed, including scores of Burbank alumni who flew in from out of state, eyed the place before kickoff and muttered to one other, ""Is this really ours?""""It's great for Burbank, and it's good for us to be here because they've played at our place so many years in a row,"" Grant assistant coach Carl Reed said. ""This is a nice place.""Grant coaches said they will learn from this rare experience of back-to-back losses, with defensive coordinator Reggie Harris saying, ""We have to look at ourselves and ask, How can I be a better coach; how can we be better players?"" Harris said. ""This tests our competitive spirit."""\u000a

V"Of all the treasures at the Crocker Art Museum, perhaps the greatest is the trove of Old Master drawings that was first collected by Judge E.B. Crocker and his wife, Margaret, in the 19th century and is still growing with gifts from Sacramento-area collectors.The expanding collection includes approximately 1,500 master drawings that are on view in rotating exhibitions in the Anne and Malcolm McHenry Works on Paper Study Center on the museum's second floor. Among the strengths of the collection are 16th and 17th century Italian drawings; 17th century drawings from the Netherlands and Flanders; 17th and 18th century French drawings; and 18th and 19th century German drawings.Rare examples of each are up in ""The Artist's View: Landscape Drawings From the Crocker Art Museum,"" a wonderfully intimate show of mostly small works on paper curated by the Crocker's William Breazeale.Breazeale notes that the exhibit was partly inspired by old photographs of students at the Sacramento School of Design, which was started at the Crocker in 1886.""They met in the ballroom, and we have pictures of them out in the landscape making sketches,"" said Breazeale. ""California art at that time focused on the landscape.  This show offers a look at what people did with the landscape in the 16th to 19th centuries.""The exhibition begins with a 16th century drawing by Willem van Bemmel of an artist sketching in the landscape. Here the artist brings himself into the picture, which depicts a farmstead with trees. It's a subtle drawing that sets the theme for the show.Landscape, Breazeale said, first appeared in European art as the setting for religious and mythological subjects. Thus, there are two drawings of the holy family's flight into Egypt. Because the artists had not been to Egypt, they had to make up the landscapes, using foliage familiar to them from their own areas but interjecting symbols of Egypt such as the obelisk and sphinx that grace Jan van Huysum's red chalk drawing ""Landscape With the Rest on the Flight Into Egypt.""More true to life is Marten de Cock's ""Riverside Landscape,"" a small, atmospheric drawing that is revealed to be full of intricate detail when examined through a magnifying glass. The museum has provided several glasses for people to be able to pick out small details that are found in many of the drawings on view.Minuscule human figures are found in many of the drawings to give a sense of scale. Many delicate details emerge in Jan van Call I's watercolor ""The Tolhuis,"" which depicts a large structure along a riverbank with tiny boats. Similarly revealing when looked at under the magnifying glass is Josua de Grave's ""Infantry on the March Between Vilvoorde and Brussels,"" with a seemingly endless line of tiny soldiers marching across the landscape.While some of the drawings in the show depict idealized landscapes, often of classical ruins or Roman landscapes, such as Johann Christoph Erhard's dramatic scene of a monk visiting ruins and Gaspard Dughet's ""Landscape in the Roman Campagna,"" others look closely and naturalistically at the landscape. Among these are Johann Alexander Thiele's icily precise rendering of a marble crag and Jean Baptiste Huet the Elder's ""Study of a Grassy Hillock.""Among the treasures in the show are a Barbizon landscape by Theodore Rousseau, which was a gift from the McHenrys, and a smudgy, stumped charcoal image of woodcutters in a forest by Camille Corot, a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Neuhaus. These marvelous French drawings bring the show into the 19th century and demonstrate that the collection is still growing, thanks to the generosity of museum patrons.The Artist's View: Landscape Drawings From the Crocker Art MuseumWhere: Crocker Art Museum, 216 O St.,SacramentWhen: Through Jan. 6, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday.

V"On the surface, the works of Irving Marcus and Peter Stegall would seem to have little in common. Marcus' dreamlike images at b. sakata garo place distorted figures in complex compositions that suggest emotional states. Stegall's cool geometric abstractions at Bows & Arrows bear no reference to visible reality and seem to be calm and meditative. What the two artists have in common is a feeling for vibrant, radical color  color that becomes a thing in itself.The imagery in Marcus' work is intriguing. In ""Sit Up,"" an oil pastel on paper, two women face each other. One, a sickly and fragile creature with a pale face, sits up on a bed. The other, dressed as a Japanese geisha, holds up a cat. On the wall between them is a painting or print of what might be Mount Fuji.It's a suggestive scene, an intimate encounter between two enigmatic figures, perhaps a patient and healer. But it is the color that stages the real drama, the brilliant reds, oranges and yellows of the Japanese woman's kimono, the pale yellow-green of the other woman's skin and the delicate blues and greens of her dress.Nearby, a large oil painting titled ""In Two"" gives us another two women  one stretched out on what might be a rooftop or a tatami mat, the other floating away from her in the sky. It might be a scene of the soul leaving the body. The red roof and the blues and blue greens of the figure's clothing make a vibrant contrast, as do the darker pink of the reclining figure's face and the lighter pink of the floating figure's limbs.In the oil pastel ""Incense"" we see another female figure, a red-haired woman dressed in tones of mauve and purple, who holds up a glowing taper. She is followed by mysterious figures in varying shades of intense blue. Some kind of ritual seems to be taking place, perhaps a healing one, but again it is the color, so hallucinatory, that draws us into the scene.While some of the works in the show are reprises from his exhibit at the Blue Line Gallery last fall, these new pieces seem to be of a different order. In contrast to the violent color of ""Penthouse"" and ""Scream,"" there is a fragility to these that is nonetheless compelling.Several of the smaller oil pastels exhibit a wacky sense of humor. ""King Kong"" gives us a small green gorilla confronted by a large pink human, the whole image flaring like flames. ""Queen Elizabeth,"" with her blue face and hair, looks like Chairman Mao. ""Vision"" is a vibrant scene of samurai warriors in a kabuki dance of bold colors.Stegall's work at Bows & Arrows consists of one large striped painting and several groupings of smaller rectangular and circular pieces. As they are arranged, they make a strong statement as an installation, the color and shapes setting up a dance of sorts.On one wall, a series of rectangles called ""painted objects"" assert themselves boldly. These small works, made up of geometric shapes and close-keyed brilliant colors, are eye candy of the highest order. They wake your eyes up with sizzling vibrations and halations. In one work, Stegall places triangular shapes in lavender, gray and green in scintillating relationships that make your eyes literally jump.On the opposing wall, he places a large, door-size panel of stripes at the center, its tones of pure, intense color  green, blue, navy, and blue-green  jumping out at you. Around this large piece, he has scattered rectangular and circular ""objects"" in quirky arrangements.The circular objects, which have three dimensions, are a new wrinkle for Stegall, at least new to me, and they have a quixotic quality that is appealingly wacky. Equally compelling are groupings of small stripe paintings as intense, despite their small size, as anything by Kenneth Noland or the Washington, D.C., stripe painters of the 1960s.Bows & Arrows is an unusual venue for an art gallery. Divided roughly into three sections, it houses a clothing store and a cafe, which often presents live music. Sandwiched in between are two bare walls for hanging artwork.Stegall's work is so strong that it holds up to what might otherwise be distracting surroundings.IRVING MARCUS: PAINTINGSWhere: b. sakata garo, 923 20th St., Sacramento When: Noon-6 p.m. Tuesday- Saturday through March 2.

V"GUINDA  From across Northern California, they came for links, ribs, jazz, gospel and a rare taste of Yolo County's secret African American past.About 500 folks packed the old Grange Hall Saturday for Guinda's annual ""celebration of our multicultural heritage and black history.""What many of them didn't know is that Guinda was once ""a refuge for freed slaves"" and one of California's oldest African American communities, said organizer Clarence Van Hook, a musician and amateur historian from Woodland.In this Capay Valley town on Highway 16, beyond the vineyards, orchards, Mexican restaurants and the Cache Creek Casino Resort, African American pioneers homesteaded thousands of acres of land. They built a multicultural school and sent their offspring to UC Berkeley and other universities.By the early 1900s, at least 50 African Americans lived along ""The Summit"" above Cache Creek on the north side of Highway 16, across from the Grange Hall.""Yolo County was a haven for African Americans,"" said Monette H. Perrin, a local historian and performance artist who's writing a book, ""Mending A Bridge  the African American Experience in Yolo County from 1850-1950.""Here in the Capay Valley, there wasn't much racial tension, Perrin said, ""because the only way to survive up there was to help each other out.""One of the earliest pioneers was Basil Campbell, a slave from Missouri who settled land near Putah Creek with his master, J.D. Stephens, in 1854.""He was in indentured servitude for 10 years, but bought his freedom for $700 after seven,"" Perrin said.Stephens, who opened the Bank of Woodland, gave Campbell ""$10,000 in stocks and bonds he'd invested for him,"" Perrin said.Campbell used the money to buy his wife's freedom in Missouri, than returned to the Capay Valley to buy land and livestock, Van Hook said.""By the time of his death in 1906, Campbell owned 5,000 acres of land in Yolo County, and the semi-weekly Mail of Woodland referred to him as the wealthiest negro in Superior California,"" added Perrin.""Apparently there was a racial incident at a Yolo County school where his grandchildren went and he actually had the school moved to his property in (the) Zamora area in the 1890s,"" Perrin said.African American pioneers also opened the Summit School House in Guinda, where 20 children of different races crossed a foot bridge over Cache Creek to learn the three R's along with history, art, geography and music from three white teachers who came up the hill by horse and buggy, Perrin said. ""Whites, gypsies and children of other races would come up there to school.""Some of the pioneers' descendants still live in the area, including Jeannette Molson of Woodland, whose great-grandfather Green Berry Logan  born to an African American mother and a white father in Arkansas  farmed 160 acres in the Capay Valley in the 1890s.Molson said her grandfather, Alvin Alfred Logan, was a skilled debater who went to Liberia to try to establish trade ties in 1903.""He got a fever and came back to Guinda in 1904,"" said Molson. ""He had 10 children and made sure the girls went to college. My mother graduated from Berkeley.""More than a hundred Capay Valley babies were delivered by Mary Francis Gaither, an African American pioneer who helped establish Woodland's Second Baptist Church in 1894, Perrin said. ""It's still operating today.""The Capay Valley became so famous among African Americans that San Francisco businesswoman Mary Ellen Pleasant, a runaway slave who helped dozens of slaves find freedom, arranged marriages in Guinda, Perrin said.In the 1940s, African Americans opened the Rancho Wena Resort in Brooks, a place of refuge ""where they could relax and entertain and socialize,"" Perrin said.The co-organizer of Saturday's event, Bill Petty, 83, moved to Guinda in 1942. ""My dad, a civil rights activist, won the first voting rights case in the state of North Carolina in 1936,"" Petty said. ""They burned our house down so we moved to Guinda. There was a little bit of everybody up there, and they got along good.""Petty said African Americans were so prosperous in Guinda that the summit was labeled on the county map as a form of heaven using a racist term. ""I filed a discrimination suit here in Woodland and they removed it,"" he said.Petty told Saturday's gathering: ""There's no such thing as Black History Month  it's really American history that's left out of the books.""Petty's message resonated with three siblings from Woodland who are among the 4,300 African Americans in Yolo County  2 percent of the population, but more than the 418 in 1950, according to the state Department of Finance.Allaina Robertson, 16, and her sister Elise, 13, said they enjoyed the event's multicultural flavor and the history imparted by the speakers.""It's really good we're getting to celebrate this day,"" added their brother Lee, 12, ""But it should be told a lot more than every February."""\u000a

V"Beer Week isn't about showing off your knowledge of buzzwords describing what you're seeing, smelling and tasting, but you might enjoy the experience (and conversation) more if you understand some of the vocabulary. Here are just a few of the many terms you can throw around so you'll fit right in with beer aficionados.Craft brewery  Technically, an individual brewery that produces 6 million barrels or less in a year (for most craft brewers, far less than that). Think small, personal, artisanal and independent.India pale ale (IPA)  A style of beer with a devoted following. Northern California is a major player in this beer style, noted for its citrusy and piney flavor notes along with varying degrees of bitterness, a crisp mouthfeel, medium body and, often, a long finish.Hops and ""hoppy""  If you dig India pale ales, it's the coveted hoppy bitterness you're tasting. Hops are the backbone of good beer and come in many varietals, allowing brewmasters to tweak and tune their recipes and achieve balance and character.Seasonal beer  A limited release. Often a chance for a brewmaster to do something very special. Example: Pliny the Younger.Session beer  When you want to taste and appreciate beer without getting blitzed, this is an option. Lower alcohol and still plenty of flavor and complexity. These beers are on the rise."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/16/4990044/as-civil-war-drags-out-syrias.html,"BAB AL-SALAM, Syria  It was cold and drizzling as yet another family made homeless by war arrived in this town in northern Syria to start a new life in a tent. Khadija al-Ali seemed to be trying not to cry as she explained how in the space of a week she had gone from middle-class housewife to homeless single mother. Ali had lived a comfortable life in the northern city of Aleppo with her husband, a tailor, and their three children, ages 6, 3 and 1. Then, a week ago, a Syrian government jet dropped a bomb that destroyed the family house, but no one was home and the family members thanked God that they were safe. A couple of days later, Ali's husband disappeared in Aleppo. Maybe he was arrested at a checkpoint, or hit by a bomb, or targeted by the snipers now common in the city. One Aleppo resident told me about a friend who had been shot by a sniper in the shoulder and leg. It was too dangerous to pull him to safety, and he died on the street two days later. ""I just don't know what happened,"" Ali told me blankly, while her cousin (who confirmed the story) suggested that the husband is probably dead. An aid worker from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent arrived with loaves of bread for the family, which the children ate hungrily. When pieces fell into the mud, they picked them up and brushed them off. And blankets are even harder to come by than food. ""I'm afraid my kids will die in this cold weather,"" she fretted. Multiply Ali by more than a million and you get the scale of Syria's torment. Already, nearly 40,000 people have been killed in the civil war, and some 2.5 million are displaced from their homes. President Barack Obama and other world leaders have avoided intervening in Syria for fear of destabilizing the region and empowering Islamic fundamentalists. The West is also nervous of the rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes extremist elements and has committed atrocities itself. The Western concerns are legitimate, and plenty of Syrians have mixed feelings about the Free Syrian Army. Some fighters engage in looting or kidnapping, and many are poorly trained and unprofessional. (The establishment of a new umbrella coalition of the Syrian opposition, immediately recognized by France, may help a bit.) My take is that rural Syrians are generally supportive of the Free Syrian Army, while some city dwellers resent it as an armed mob that irresponsibly moves into neighborhoods knowing that the result will be government bombs that will devastate those streets. It's also true that Islamic militants and foreign fighters are playing an increasing, but still tiny, role in the combat. Some of that is real, and some is Kabuki: Groups of fighters have realized that the best way to get weapons is to grow beards, quote from the Quran and troll for support in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. A secular pro-Western businessman who lost his 18-year-old son to a bomb said he didn't agree with the militants, but he still welcomed them. ""They have the humanity to help,"" he said, contrasting their assistance with Western indifference. An imam, a bit distracted because he was preparing to smuggle a rebel flag into Aleppo, at the risk of execution, put it this way: ""The Americans are with the Syrians, but they just want to talk."" There are dangers with greater involvement, and Syria is a more difficult arena in which to intervene than Libya was, but let's acknowledge that the existing hands-off approach has failed. Western passivity has backfired and accelerated all that Washington fears: chaos, regional instability, sectarianism and growing influence of Islamic militants. The United States certainly shouldn't send boots on the ground. But there are steps we can take to save lives, hasten an end to the war, reduce the risks to the region and protect American interests as well. A sensible menu includes a NATO-backed no-fly zone over parts of northern Syria, transfers of weapons and ammunition (though not anti-aircraft weapons) to the Free Syrian Army, training and intelligence support, and cooperation with rebels to secure chemical weapons.""The government kills us every day, and nobody cares about us,"" said Aisha Muhammad, who doesn't know her age but looked to be in her 70s. She said that a government sniper had shot one of her two sons, costing him his arm, and that the other had been arrested five months ago and not heard from since. Asked if he is still alive, she teared up and gulped: ""I don't know."" Her entire village has been destroyed, and she is now living out her old age alone, in a soggy, chilly tent. For her and other homeless Syrians, there's only one certainty: Winter will make the coming months even more wretched."\u000a

V"Edith Chavez hopes one day to be an engineer. Next month, she will be one of eight students from Western Sierra Collegiate Academy in Rocklin who will travel to Los Angeles to represent Placer County in the California State Science Fair.The 16-year-old, along with 100 other students from fourth through 12th grades, competed Saturday at William Jessup University in Rocklin for the Placer County STEM Expo. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math.Chavez, a junior, presented her science project to judges and spectators. Her project investigated the brown planarian, a species of worm that regenerates after being cut in half.""There's chemical engineering and biomedical engineering. I haven't decided,"" Chavez said, when asked what field she would like to work in.Local educators say there's a shortage of budding scientists and engineers  talent that is increasingly in demand as industries modernize their operations.""The country is falling behind in math and science,"" said Eric Bull, professor of liberal studies at William Jessup.Bull, who was once an elementary school science teacher, came up with the idea of holding a science fair for Placer-area students three years ago, as a way to build interest in the sciences at an early age. The focus, Bull said, is on science, technology, engineering and math  key pieces to any technical job or education.Quincy Trott, 14, of Twelve Bridges Middle School in Lincoln, entered the fair at the last minute.""I started working on this last night at 8,"" Trott said, pointing to a Lego-made robot attached to his arm. The robot, designed for a person with disabilities, allows the user to grab and release a single object. Trott said the robot runs on software from a minicomputer that is attached.Retired chemist Gerald Oliver chuckled with students as he asked questions and listened to the responses. This is his third year judging the fair.""There's honest, real research that is not just copied from a book,"" he said of the projects. Oliver voiced regret that budget cuts and standardized testing have shifted the focus away from science and onto core subjects like English.""In my day, science was an important subject,"" said Oliver, who went to school in the 1960s. President Barack Obama has pushed for more science and math education in the nation's schools.""When students excel in math and science, they help America compete for the jobs and industries of the future,"" the president said last year during the White House's annual science fair.EXPO WINNERSEight students, all from Western Sierra Collegiate Academy in Rocklin, won top honors at Saturday's Placer County STEM Expo.

V"Aldo the drug-sniffing dog and his canine colleagues won a big treat at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, as justices unanimously approved a sniff search that had led to a Florida bust.In a case closely watched by law enforcement officials and dog lovers alike, the court concluded that Aldos alert signs during a routine traffic stop in Liberty County, Fla., had provided a sheriffs deputy with probable cause to conduct a search. The deputy didnt find the drugs Aldo was trained for, but did find materials used for making methamphetamine.Training records established Aldos reliability in detecting drugs, Justice Elena Kagan wrote for all nine justices.Although straightforward and relatively brief, the courts 11-page decision may have a broad reach for the many law enforcement agencies that rely on trained dogs. In accepting Aldos training records as sufficient, the justices rejected a Florida Supreme Court ruling that would have required officials to produce a dogs field performance records  including instances of false alerts, when drugs werent found  in order to demonstrate a dog's reliability when a search was challenged.Kagan countered that the Florida Supreme Courts strict evidentiary checklist was too rigid in judging canine reliability, especially as errors may abound in a dogs field performance.The better measure of a dogs reliability thus comes away from the field, in controlled testing environments, Kagan wrote. For that reason, evidence of a dogs satisfactory performance in a certification or training program can itself provide sufficient reason to trust his alert.Underscoring the stakes, 24 states had sided with Florida law enforcement officials. The states  including Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Idaho  noted in a legal brief that drug-detecting canines are one of the essential weapons in the states arsenal to combat this illegal traffic.A second drug-sniffing case out of Florida, involving a chocolate Labrador retriever named Franky and a 2006 house search conducted by the Miami-Dade Police Department, hasnt yet been decided, although it was argued before the Supreme Court on the same day.Aldo, a German shepherd, had completed a 120-hour training course given by the Apopka, Fla., police department. Hed also received a one-year certification from Drugbeat, a private Missouri-based company that trains and certifies dogs for law enforcement. Once certified, Aldo and his handler, K-9 Officer William Wheetley, underwent regular training sessions.Aldo and Wheetley were on patrol the afternoon of June 24, 2006, when the deputy sheriff pulled over a pickup near the town of Bristol, in Floridas panhandle. The pickup had an expired tag.The truck belonged to . . . Clayton Harris, attorney Gregory Garre wrote in a brief for the state of Florida. It was not going to be his day.Harris seemed nervous, and the deputy saw an open beer can. He brought Aldo over and the dog got excited, and then Aldo sat down as an alert, next to the trucks front door. Under the drivers seat, Wheetley found 200 pseudoephedrine pills, which can be used to manufacture methamphetamine.Harris defense attorney, Tallahassee-based Assistant Public Defender Glen P. Gifford, noted that Aldos original training had been with another officer and the dogs certification was out of date.Because a dog cannot be cross-examined like a police officer on the scene, whose observations often provide the basis for probable cause to search a vehicle, the state must introduce evidence concerning the dogs reliability, Florida Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente reasoned. In cases involving dog sniffing for narcotics, it is particularly evident that the courts often accept the mythic dog with an almost superstitious faith.But in the decision Tuesday, the Supreme Court concluded that the Florida courts checklist, notably including field performance records, imposed too strict a burden for law enforcement. Instead, Kagan said, a flexible, common-sense standard should be applied in testing reliability, with completion of a training program potentially all thats needed.After all, Kagan wrote, law enforcement units have their own strong incentive to use effective training and certification programs, because only accurate drug-detection dogs enable officers to locate contraband without incurring unnecessary risks or wasting limited time and resources."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/22/5205088/nice-effort-but-ultima-story-packs.html,"""Bless Me, Ultima,"" the film based on Rudolfo Anaya's landmark Chicano novel, is a meticulously observed time capsule, a vivid re- creation of a self-contained world of Mexican-Americans in 1944 New Mexico.It's a coming-of-age picture with a touch of magical realism, about a boy whose family witch comes to stay. It's an engaging yarn, set in a place, a time and among a people rarely represented on the big screen. But ""Ultima"" is a poetic novel that becomes prosaic on the screen.Ultima (veteran character actress Mriam Coln) doesn't call herself a ""witch."" Skilled with herbs and wise in the way of curses, she is young Antonio's ""curandera,"" his aunt and protector. The boy (Luke Ganalon) is 7 and just starting school. His older brothers are away fighting World War II. His parents (Dolores Heredia and Benito Martinez) are busy with their dusty, hardscrabble farm.Ultima arrives to teach Antonio of the healing powers of plants, the mythic role of the owl in their lives and the power of faith and superstition.A war veteran goes mad and shoots someone. Antonio, who is taking catechism classes, wants to know, ""Will he go to hell?""""That's not for us to say. Men will do as they must,"" Ultima responds.Then, a relative is ""cursed"" by some local witches and Ultima's true power within the family is tested. She can save him, yes.But ""When one tampers with the fate of a man, a chain of events is set in motion,"" she warns.That chain is a feud between her and the family of witches she is in conflict with.The locals are quick to accuse Ultima of being a witch, reluctant to use that word about the family of wealthy cafe owner Tenurio (Castulo Guerra). There are lynch mobs and family betrayals, soldiers returning from war with higher expectations than farming, a drunken seer who sees all and dissolute young men who spend what they earn in the village brothel.And all along, young Antonio goes to school, watches classmates endure the discipline of the priest and thrives in spite of being teased for bringing burritos for lunch.It's all properly colorful, but terribly flat dramatically.Writer-director Carl Franklin (""Devil in a Blue Dress"") promises bullying, climactic battles between tradition and modernity  and never delivers.Alfred Molina narrates the tale, Antonio as an adult, but his adult self doesn't resolve the boy's theological debates with his nonbelieving schoolmates or have a take on what a child of 7, a fearful witness to Ultima's exorcism of a curse, might have really seen.And in spending much of the movie on the coming-of-age story, Franklin doesn't bless the film with nearly enough ""Ultima,"" ultimately, to make it take flight.He loses the forest amid all those scruffy New Mexican trees.BLESS ME, ULTIMA   Cast: Mriam Coln, Luke Ganalon, Benito Martinez, Joaquin CosioDirector: Carl Franklin 104 minutesRated PG-13 (some violence and sexual references)"\u000a

V"Spencer Hagan is no stranger to long odds, and here he goes again.The hard-luck Cal tight end out of Capital Christian High School is confronted with his greatest athletic challenge. He is dealing with a lost season after suffering a devastating injury that will take months of rehabilitation and prompted Bears coach Jeff Tedford to say, ""His knee is shot."" Shot for the time being, yes. Long term? Too early to say.Unlike the knee surgery of earlier generations when a shredded knee ligament was the kiss of death to playing careers, athletes do recover from ""shot"" knees. Witness the Vikings' Adrian Peterson. The 49ers got a look at his leg drive Sunday. On the local high school scene this fall, there is linebacker Hank Humphers of Nevada Union. The senior made a full recovery from reconstructive knee surgery with rehabilitation the key.Hagan went down at Ohio State two weeks ago in a gruesome scene that leaves one to conclude knees just are not made for the rigors of this game.Scott Hagan was at the Horseshoe in Columbus, Ohio, that day and hustled down through the masses and past security to ease the anxiety of his son lying in a training room. There were X-rays to see if the damage also included broken bones.""We could hear the roars of the fans during that crazy fourth quarter but had no idea what was happening,"" Scott Hagan said Monday after confirming the seriousness of the injury. ""It's a severe injury. It's very touching for (me) to see the genuine love and affection his teammates and coaches had for him. They know what this game means to him.""Hagan suffered a torn MCL and ACL and a lateral tear of the meniscus in his right knee. The junior will undergo surgery this weekend in Oakland.Recovery time, at best, is nine months. The outpouring of support came from teammates who understood the work Hagan put into the Bears. Hagan went from walking on out of a Division V high school to playing last season to starting this season at H-back.Tedford was so impressed with his tight ends that he visited New England coach Bill Belichick over the summer to discuss how the Patriots maximize the position.Tedford has long raved about Hagan's ability to block, catch and run at 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds. Hagan and Cal hope to count 2012 as a medical redshirt season.Tight end hopefulsHagan's misfortune suddenly becomes an opportunity for Harrison Wilfley and Spencer Briare, Cal tight ends with local ties.Wilfley excelled at Casa Roble and American River College. He spent the previous two years on a Mormon mission in Uruguay. Briare, a walk-on from Granite Bay, is a Bee All-Metro player who helped the Grizzlies to a championship season last fall. Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick of Whitney High has seen time as a true freshman tight end for USC.

V"A media war is brewing at UC Davis, but it doesn't involve blogs or Twitter. It's a battle between two newspapers.Last month, a group of students published the first issue of the Davis Beat, a biweekly tabloid that competes directly with the long-standing broadsheet student paper, the California Aggie. ""Competition between newspapers increases their quality,"" said Adrian Glass-Moore, editor-in-chief of the Davis Beat. ""There's a pressure to be fast and to get it straight."" Reminiscent of a bygone era when cities had competing dailies, the move comes at a critical time for newspapers  an industry that continues to evolve as circulation drops, advertising falls and media are consumed online.For college papers, the situation is even more precarious, since they target a demographic of 18-year-olds to 20-somethings who are more likely to read news on their iPads than to pick up a newspaper.In its heyday, the 98-year-old Aggie published 12,000 copies a day, five days a week, and paid every staff member. But in recent years, as advertising revenue dried up, editors took pay cuts, reporters worked for free and circulation was cut by more than half. The paper lost $61,000 last year, according to its editors.""We feared that the Aggie wouldn't be able to keep going for more than another year,"" Janelle Bitker, the paper's editor-in-chief, said in an interview. ""This is a structural model that doesn't work.""On Thursday, Bitker announced in an open letter to the campus that the Aggie would start printing only one day a week instead of four, citing the organization's ongoing budget crisis.""It's the same sad story that every print newspaper tells  fewer and fewer people get their information from newspapers,"" Bitker wrote.The Beat received $1,800 in startup funds from the university, which is enough to publish four issues. The staff doesn't get paid, nor does it get campus offices rent free like the Aggie. Eventually, the Beat will have to rely on advertising or move solely online once its seed money is gone. (Both papers are available for free.)Beat editors say their paper gives students another voice on campus, and the biweekly schedule allows them to ""tackle issues critically"" with an eye for investigative journalism.""The ability to choose where you get your news is essential,"" said Glass-Moore, who drew his inspiration from San Francisco, a city with a multitude of print media.""Print is timeless,"" added Brenna Lyles, news editor at the Davis Beat. ""There's just something attractive about it.""The Beat is available on campus news racks and from stacks outside lecture halls and dining areas. Its editors planned to meet with local business leaders Thursday to persuade them to buy print ads in what is already a tight market dominated by the Aggie and the general-circulation Davis Enterprise.Marc Cooper, a professor of journalism at the University of Southern California, called the situation of having two print papers ""a sweet, generous episode that may or may not work.""""The digital side of any publication will be increasingly important, if it's not already dominant,"" Cooper said. (Both UC Davis student papers have websites: theaggie.org and davisbeat.org.)Several college newspapers around California have resorted to supplementing their income with mandatory student fees. At Sacramento State, each of the 28,000 students contributes $6 a year to support the student paper, according to Alexandra Poggione, editor-in- chief of the State Hornet.Already, the two Davis papers have been trying to scoop each other on campus stories. ""It's never good to have a monopoly news outlet,"" Cooper said. ""Otherwise, you run the risk of falling asleep.""Said Glass-Moore: ""If anything, the Beat will be good for stimulating the Aggie."""\u000a

V"There are some stories that sound much better in short-form synopsis than they play on stage (yes, Neil LaBute, I'm looking right at you). The description tells you everything, the execution not so much. At first, the EMH Productions presentation of ""Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead"" at the Geery Theater seems like it might lean this way. The parody of the characters in ""Peanuts"" has the iconic kids all grown up (well, they've become teenagers), and it's not a pretty sight: drugs, eating disorders, bullying, sexual identity issues  sort of like an MTV series I saw once. Well, it's not something Charles Schulz would have imagined or likely sanctioned, and his estate hasn't authorized or approved the script by Bert V. Royal.The play's character names refer to the comic-strip originals, such as CB for the lead, CB's Sister and Beethoven (think Schroeder). That there's no Franklin or Snoopy somehow seems like a sadly missed opportunity.Since ""Dog Sees God"" had its world premiere at the 2004 New York International Fringe Festival, it's intermittently popped up around the country. Reviews were mixed in New York, but the show received raves in England.

V"The saga of the ""West Memphis Three"" reaches a thrilling if somewhat anticlimactic conclusion in ""West of Memphis,"" a documentary financed by Peter (""Lord of the Rings"") Jackson and directed by Amy Berg.Berg, who directed ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" the documentary damning Catholic priests and child abuse, here pulls together a riveting story built on one of the most notorious murder cases of recent history. In 1993, three young boys were killed and dumped in a ditch in West Memphis, Ark. The West Memphis Three, socially outcast teenagers, were caught, tried and convicted and spent nearly two decades in prison despite rampant evidence of medical examiner incompetence and police and prosecutorial misconduct.The case was kept alive and in the public eye largely on the strength of a trio of documentaries by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky. Their ""Paradise Lost"" films inspired ongoing media interest in a case that seemed both sensational  allegations of ritual sexual abuse and satanic or occult murder  and closed thanks to ""the finality of judgment."" One of the teens confessed. Witnesses came forward alleging that one of the boys, aptly named Damien, was into the occult. The state of the bodies seemed so awful that only devil worshippers could be responsible, or so the theory went.""We've got a story that is very, very believable,"" one interview subject recalls hearing. ""So believable, it's almost perfect."" That story, manipulated by the local police and trumpeted by an ambitious prosecutor, was the one lead they pursued. It worked and won convictions.Berg, working with a private investigator hired by Jackson and longtime companion Fran Walsh, interviewed a retired FBI profiler Jackson put on the payroll, and interviewed the victims' families (who were, the closing credits tell us, compensated for the interviews). He weaves this tortured tale into a compelling narrative that has twists and turns, blind alleys and lots of interviews with Damien Echols in his jail cell.Jackson appears on camera, talking about the steps they took to immerse themselves in the case. Musician Eddie Vedder and actor Johnny Depp got deeply involved. The ""WM3"" became a cause clbre among the celebs. And then Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks got sucked into it and played an even bigger part in casting doubt on the guilt of the trio.It's a fine summation of this complicated story, one that focuses heavily on Echols and his sweeping declarations about the state of justice in Arkansas and America. Enduring almost 18 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit entitles him to that. And to the fact that Echols and a woman he met by mail and married while in prison, Lorri Davis, are producers on the film.But for all the ebb and flow of this saga, the TV news footage and snippets of newspaper stories about the case sampled here, the omission of more than a passing mention of the ""Paradise Lost"" films robs ""West of Memphis"" of some of its credibility. If anybody anywhere knows anything about this case, it's because of those two filmmakers  Berlinger and Sinofsky. They wouldn't agree to be interviewed here? Maybe they were concerned that Jackson's money would allow him and Berg to take credit at the end when they hadn't been there since the beginning.Which is the worst thing you can say about this otherwise righteous, if somewhat star-struck film. The ""Paradise Lost"" guys moved the ball down the field, all the way to the end zone. Now, a new owner and his backup quarterback are spiking the ball.

V"Long before fast-food chains came to dominate the American landscape, drive-in restaurants were the cool places to grab a basket of onion rings and a burger and hang out with your friends  no texting required (or possible). Drive-ins catered to the vibrant new car culture riding the wave of prosperity that emerged after World War II. They often employed female carhops in semi-racy costumes who rolled around the parking lot on skates. They would deliver heavy trays of grub to your car and hook them to the doors.Drive-ins also made space for hot-rod clubs that gathered weekly for show 'n' shines.Though most drive-ins are now memories, tiny Cookie's in east Sacramento keeps on keepin' on, and taking risks you wouldn't expect. For example: Daring diner Tom Negrete mentioned the other day that Cookie's had recently added camel to its lineup of unusual burgers, so we drove over for a taste test. He's the Sacramento Bee's director of innovation and news operations. Cookie's has been family-owned-and-run for 28 years. Staffing the kitchen last Friday were owner Paul Chuk and his adult children, Joyce and Jesse. The menu board shows the usual suspects  chili dog, Philly cheesesteak, fried shrimp and fish, fried mushrooms. But we were there for the low-fat, high-protein camel, buffalo, kangaroo and ostrich burgers, with a traditional hamburger as the control in our ""science test."" The burgers arrived at the service window on perfect buns from wholesaler Bennett's Bakery. We asked for condiments on the side, as we wanted to taste only the purity of meat and bread.These are our tasting notes: Beef ($4.55): ""Standard patty  thin  OK burger flavor.""Buffalo ($8.85): ""Dry and lean  slightly gamey aftertaste ... meaty and rich  dense  more flavor than the beef burger.""Ostrich: ($7.75): ""Way lean  less flavor than the beef and buffalo burgers  a little bitter.""Kangaroo: ($5.50): ""Dry and not a lot of flavor  sour  chewier than the others.""Camel ($8.50): ""Patty is thicker and moister than the others  more flavor  pretty tasty  sweeter than the beef."" We ranked them in order of our preference: camel, buffalo, beef, kangaroo and ostrich. Paul Chuk obtains the exotics from Sierra Meat Co. in Reno, which calls itself ""one of the largest distributors of game and specialty products in the United States."" Among its other offerings are antelope, iguana, llama, rattlesnake and python, turtle and yak. ""If you don't mind, I'll finish the camel,"" Tom said at meal's end.

This is the only California location, said manager Lisa Coleman.""They tore down a movie theater that showed 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and built us (on the site) in 1990. Everything is made fresh right here,"" said Coleman, who has been in place since 1991.The condensed story: Using family recipes, Olivia and Julio Garcia opened their first restaurant in Phoenix. Things took off. The place is strikingly well-decorated, if you look past the corporate-template feel  adobe-looking plastered walls, chandeliers (turn down the brightness, please), potted plants, tile trim, booths covered in colorful fabric, exposed wood-beam ceilings, and dramatic statuary referencing the glories of the Aztec empire that thrived in 15th century central Mexico. As we cruised the laminated menus (what's a cheeseburger doing there?), jumpy mariachi music played over hidden speakers and gleeful voices sang ""Happy Birthday"" from another room. Speedy servers weaved through the dining rooms, hefting trays full of heaped hot plates.We started with guacamole (chunky and fresh-tasting) and chicken tortilla soup (flavorful broth, lots of chicken, but served lukewarm). Next were a pair of succulent chiles rellenos (poblano peppers stuffed with oozing cheese, coated in a light batter) and a luscious cheese enchilada covered in ""red sauce."" ""This is what an enchilada sauce is supposed to taste like,"" said the lunch pal, taking a bite.""I need to taste that,"" I said. ""Over my dead body,"" she said, and didn't laugh. Too many Mexican restaurants treat the traditional beans and rice accompaniments as afterthoughts, but not Garcia's. For once, the Spanish-style rice was moist and flavorful. We knocked off firm whole pinto beans in a mild tomato-based sauce improved with shots of Cholula hot sauce (options are black or refried beans).Garcia's menu is lengthy, not only because of the multiple dishes but because of the tedious descriptions of them ($2.50 to $17.50).Will we be back? Yes, but we'll focus on the watermelon-orange margaritas and not the fine print. Garcia's Mexican restaurant, 6049 Madison Ave., Carmichael; (916) 344-3177, www.garciasmexicanrestaurants.net.

V"Mike Alberghini is a mess. His voice is hoarse from a lingering cold. His bright blue eyes are red-rimmed from fatigue and emotion. He needs a shave, needs a pat on the back, needs a diversion, needs a hug.But his needs can wait, and he knows it. More than at any time in his 44 years on campus, his Grant High School Pacers  the entire student body, not just members of his struggling football team  need his gruff, reassuring voice, his goofy sense of humor and his comforting, consistent presence.Two of his community's young people are dead  one shot by the other, according to police.Ed Coleman, a Pacers football assistant and star running back in 1992 and 1993, and Luv C. Land died last weekend in what police believe was a murder-suicide at their North Natomas home. Alberghini, who knew Coleman as a ""good person,"" is shocked by the news. He didn't really know Land, a safety coordinator at Campbell Soup Co. in Dixon, since the two spoke only a few times. But as a grandfather and father, he can't imagine the hell her parents are enduring.""If you coach long enough, you've met your tragedies,"" Alberghini said. ""I've lost kids, assistant coaches, but never anything like this. What took place last weekend? This is all so raw. As head of this staff, I feel a lot of pressure to handle this the right way. But the one thing  well, it puts everything into perspective.""A week ago, 2012 was merely a trying season, not a traumatizing one. The Pacers, who host Del Oro tonight, have lost three consecutive games for the first time since Alberghini took over the program in 1991. Lofty preseason expectations have plummeted with the rankings. A playoff berth  a near-certainty throughout Alberghini's reign  is in jeopardy, partly because of academic issues and injuries.Linebacker Moses Moala is the latest Pacers standout to be sidelined indefinitely. On Thursday, the strong, hulking junior, appearing ready to cry, handed his coach a copy of the X-rays that confirmed a foot fracture.""We thought we were going to be a lot better,"" said Alberghini, 65, shaking his head. ""These teams that think they're playing the Grant of the past, and have been on the short end of it, are certainly enjoying this. We have to find answers, start playing a lot better on both sides of the ball. You're never prepared for failure, especially around here. We're spoiled.""The entire region is spoiled. For the better part of two decades, Grant has been a compelling, provocative, entertaining story. On Friday nights, the stadium is filled with friends, relatives, future stars and former players, including several who went on to the NFL.The school has experienced uplifting times, including the upset of Long Beach Poly for the 2008 CIF state championship, as well as the societal issues common to districts and programs in similar demographic areas.According to the California Department of Education, for example, 87 percent of Grant's students received free or reduced-price meals in 2010-11. Only 75 percent cite English as the primary language. And as Alberghini so often notes, budget cuts have trimmed valuable, life-enhancing programs  academic, athletic and vocational.Alberghini's preachiness is one of his most endearing qualities. Known affectionately around campus as ""Coach Al,"" Alberghini is an institution, an impassioned, unrelenting advocate for kids. Though retired from teaching for three years, he is on campus throughout the day, monitoring players' classwork, ducking his head into classes and stopping to chat with athletes and students.""He's the godfather, right?"" principal Craig Murray said. ""There's just one of him. I don't think the school would still be standing if he wasn't still here. He keeps caring and believing in our school.""And now? After the horrific last weekend? Alberghini has to remind everyone that, for all his success, he has always been about more than football. He has been a teacher, a nurturer, an enduring father figure. He has been a standup member of the entire region, not just of Del Paso Heights.That can't change. When the police complete their investigation into the deaths, the details and toxicology reports becoming available, he has to respond directly, forcefully, proactively.""Some days are really challenging,"" Alberghini said, nodding, ""but I started here in 1969. You grow close to people. I don't want to retire. As long as I'm meaningful, I want to stay."""\u000a

V"Elvis Presley strolled into the Memphis studios of Sun Records with his friend Marilyn Evans on Tuesday, Dec. 4, 1956, and when they left a few hours later, history had been made.Presley joined Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash in a completely spontaneous vocal jam session of gospel and country tunes they all knew, throwing in some of their own music as well.Presley had just become the biggest star in the world, so the event was news then. A staged photograph of the four singers in the studio appeared in the Memphis Press-Scimitar the next day, calling them ""The Million Dollar Quartet."" These days, musical theater products are generated on significantly less-promising scenarios than this one, so the upcoming Broadway Sacramento production called ""The Million Dollar Quartet"" has a fascinating and fact-based premise.Though some of what took place is disputed  who was there when and for how long  most of the actual music the men made that day was thoughtfully documented by a studio engineer who figured it would be a good idea to have some tape rolling. What is known for sure is that Perkins and his brothers who played in his band had come to Sun that day to record. Perkins was looking for an elusive follow-up to his hit ""Blue Suede Shoes.""Sun Records owner Sam Phillips had brought his latest discovery, the largely unknown piano player Lewis, to help fill out Perkins' raw rockabilly sound. Presley, a former Sun artist now on the major label RCA, dropped in to hang out and escape the suddenly mounting pressure of his stunning rise to stardom.Cash, another Sun artist at the time, wrote in his autobiography that he was there the whole time to check out the Perkins session. Cash's voice can't be particularly distinguished on most of the recordings, leading to speculation that he left the sessions early. He said that he was farthest from the microphone.Phillips is often credited with orchestrating a fertile artistic crossroads in American popular music. Colin Escott, who co-wrote the musical's book with Floyd Mutrux, said that Phillips' independent spirit neatly supported the rock 'n' roll sensibility emerging from his studios.""Phillips had the ears and the knowledge at a time when so few white people could really pick up on African American culture and to separate out good from bad,"" Escott said. ""But when B.B. King or Howlin' Wolf came into his studio, he knew here were artists whose work needed to be recorded. And then when Elvis Presley came in, to listen to him and see beneath the insecurity and lack of polish to hear something that probably no one else could have picked up.""Escott wrote the acclaimed book ""Good Rockin' Tonight: Sun Records and the Birth of Rock 'n' Roll"" as well ""Hank Williams: The Biography"" and other often-referenced works about the early days of rock 'n' roll and country music.""When you've worked in the record industry as I have, you have a deep appreciation for people who can see beyond trends and have a singular vision and just stick with it,"" Escott said of Phillips. ""Here's Elvis Presley, who comes in wanting to sound like Dean Martin and suddenly breaks into a rhythm and blues song with a little two-piece band behind him, and Sam Phillips is probably the only guy on earth who had the courage and insight to say 'Yeah, that's where I want to go.' ""Phillips relished the David-and-Goliath aspect of what he did, an idea that still plays out in the music industry today. His Sun Records was the indie label with its ears to the ground picking up on what was new, before the major labels came after him flashing their checkbooks.""There's a line in the play when Phillips says, 'I'd rather sell a hundred records of some guy I brought along myself than a million with somebody else calling the shots.' That's exactly the way he was,"" Escott said.Escott said they have taken some creative liberties with the events of Dec. 4, 1956, by cramming 18 months of Sun Records history into one night.As Martin Kaye, who plays Jerry Lee Lewis, said, ""You have to stay true to the event, but you also have to make it a show."" Part of the show is that all the actors play their own instruments and all the musicians are on stage.""It adds a little bit of integrity to it because we're all just a rock 'n' roll band touring the States,"" Kaye said. The four actors playing the principals harmonize just as the actual Million Dollar Quartet did, and the music moves from the gospel and country base the singers all knew into some of their familiar hits from later in their careers.""On the whole, we feel an amazing energy. It's quite surreal sometimes,"" Kaye said of the performances. ""People just connect with us on such a personal level.""For the old 'uns, it's something that they grew up with, it's something that they know  taking them back to their childhood. For the young 'uns, it's a chance to see live musicians playing a show and telling a story about their heritage. Because rock 'n' roll is American music."""\u000a

V"It takes forever to get going, and lollygags even after that.As a businessman scrambling to find a way to get his son's federal prison sentence reversed, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has to play fear, tough love, pity and panic  and he's a bit in over his head.But that's the point of ""Snitch,"" a straight-no-chaser thriller ""inspired by a true story."" The pacing is off, too many scenes lack dramatic punch and play like filler. But Johnson is pretty good at being a guy in over his head, sharing scenes with flinty pros such as Susan Sarandon, Benjamin Bratt and Barry Pepper.It's a tale of a civilian who gets mixed up in the feds-vs.-Mexican drug cartels war, whose ""mandatory minimum sentencing"" has snared John Matthews' naive 18-year-old son. The prosecutor (Sarandon) is a hard case, readying a run for Congress. So John makes a deal  he'll get ""an introduction"" into that world through his construction supply business. He'll use his Jefferson City, Mo., trucks for transport, and they'll nail big players from the cartel.Co-writer/director Ric Roman Waugh is a stuntman turned director. But he wastes a staggering amount of time setting that scenario up, and even more time getting to the point where his experience regarding nondigital stunts pays off. Some of that establishes that John is a fish out of water and shows us his learning curve. Mostly, though, that slow pacing robs the story of tension and suspense.What gives the film juice is the supporting cast. Jon Bernthal (Shane in ""The Walking Dead"") is credibly wary as the ex-con whom John begs to get him in the door of the drug world. And the terrific Michael Kenneth Williams is the first dealer he meets, a guy who pulls a gun on him just to test him.Waugh can be forgiven for giving these guys more scenes than are absolutely necessary. They're that good.Pepper sports a Civil War- worthy goatee in his role as an undercover fed who frets over John's safety. Rafi Gavron is properly frightened as the boy who let a friend entrap him with a box full of pills and sets this whole saga in motion, though Waugh loses track of the kid for much of the movie. We need reminding of the stakes, the danger.But I like the way Johnson, often shot in extreme close-ups, underplays this guy. And I like the way the script lets John's ineptitude and discomfort in this world create the humor, the way Waugh has some scenes set to music, no sound effects, the way he dispenses with the obligatory ""I'm gonna need to head to the gun shop"" scene and the way the man films a car and truck chase  rending metal, shattered glass, none of that digital fuss and fakery.""Snitch"" isn't a great film. But after the run of brawling, over-the-top shoot-'em-ups and drive-'em-ups that have cluttered Johnson's rsum it's good to see him try his hand at acting, even if he is just as overmatched as the fellow he's playing.SNITCH   1/2 Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Susan Sarandon, Barry Pepper, Benjamin Bratt, Jon BernthalDirector: Ric Roman Waugh112 minutesRated PG-13 (drug content and sequences of violence)"\u000a

V"Every so often a musician comes along who takes a conceptual leap with an instrument, without an inkling that an evolution is under way.One of those is classical guitarist Paul Galbraith. It doesn't take long to glean what the evolution is when Galbraith performs: As Galbraith plays his classical guitar, he cradles it almost vertically. At first glance it looks as if he is playing a cello.It's an upright position that has become Galbraith's trademark. An endpin at the bottom of his guitar helps balance and anchor it much the way a cello is anchored. In turn, the endpin is anchored to a resonance box.If that were not unexpected enough, Galbraith likes to perform on the not-often-seen eight-string classical guitar  two more strings than the standard classical instrument.It is known as the ""Brahms guitar""  it allows Galbraith to arrange and tackle works of Romantic-era composers.Local audiences will get to experience the charms of Galbraith's innovations when he appears at the Three Stages performing arts complex at Folsom Lake College on Saturday and Sunday.Galbraith's program includes his arrangements of J.S. Bach's Lute Suite No. 3 in G minor, Anton Webern's Variations, Opus 27, and Albeniz's ""Espaa."" Galbraith will also perform Manuel Ponce's Prelude and 20 Variations with Fugue on ""La Folia de Espaa.""The Scottish-born Galbraith, 48, began studying the classical guitar at age 11. However, he did not begin to play it in the upright position until he had reached his 20s. It was a gradual evolution. At first, it was the comfort of playing while sitting on the floor that spurred the new position, he said.""I preferred sitting on the floor to using chairs at my student flat,"" he said. ""That happened to be the way I could sit with the guitar  without having to anchor it in any way with my arm. The legs did that for me.""Over a period of three years, the angle of the neck became more and more vertical, he said.""It was then that I decided to use a cellist's endpin, and get myself a decent chair to sit on,"" he said. In short, Galbraith has popularized the eight-string guitar. The instrument allows him to arrange works for classical guitar in a way not possible on the standard six-string.However, without an influx of new works written for the eight-string, it will be a long time before the instrument is seen as other than an anomaly.""We all want to see the development of a more substantial repertoire for the guitar, which is something that the eight-string guitar I play can help open up,"" Galbraith said. ""A guitarist playing a guitar with seven, eight or more strings will have access to more repertoire than with a standard guitar,"" said Daniel Roest, president of the Sacramento Guitar Society, the organization that is bringing Galbraith to Three Stages. ""From lute transcriptions to contemporary compositions, a much wider pitch range is available on these instruments, both to the artist and the audience,"" Roest said.It seems innovation is almost a given for guitarists and composers of Galbraith's generation.This is evident locally, with the Davis-based Matthew Grasso carving out a niche performing on the extended seven-string guitar. Further afield are instrumentalists like James Kline, who has taken an innovative approach by performing on the 11-string arch-guitar.It remains to be seen whether such musicians will remain the exception and not the rule, said Scott Cmiel, a member of the guitar faculty at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.""The guitar has developed a tradition and repertoire that very much favors the six-string model,"" said Cmiel. ""Galbraith's eight-string instrument has not influenced many players to follow his example beyond his immediate collaborators and students.""However, Roest believes Galbraith has already had an influence.""Galbraith has demonstrated a ceaseless pursuit of his musical vision, to the point of significantly altering the instrument with the Brahms guitar design,"" Roest said. ""To musicians, that's very inspiring. He's been successful in performing many transcriptions of repertoire unworkable on the standard guitar.""One thing is certain: Galbraith did not set out to make big changes with the classical guitar.""I didn't change my playing style and instrument in order to revolutionize the guitar world,"" he said. ""In fact, I dislike the idea of forcing one's ideas on others.""However, he is aware that a new generation of guitarists may someday cite him as an influence.""It's quite amazing to me how many guitarists  also from different styles  are doing similar things to me,"" Galbraith said. ""Some are doing so with a similar posture, some with a similar guitar, some with both.""PAUL GALBRAITHWhen: 8 p.m. Saturday; 2 p.m. SundayWhere: Recital Hall, Three Stages Performing Arts Center, Folsom Lake College, FolsomTickets: $15-$44Information: (916) 608-6888; https://www.threestages.net"\u000a

V"A big-budget, effects-laden, 3-D retelling of the Jack and the Beanstalk legend may seem like the unlikeliest pairing yet of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie, but ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" ends up being smart, thrilling and a whole lot of fun.Singer and McQuarrie's collaborations include, most famously, the twisty crime mystery ""The Usual Suspects"" (which earned McQuarrie an original-screenplay Oscar) and the Hitler assassination drama ""Valkyrie,"" featuring an eye patch-wearing Tom Cruise. They've sort of been all over the place together over the past couple of decades  so why not reinterpret a classic fairy tale? This time, the screenwriter is aided by Darren Lemke and Dan Studney; nevertheless there remains a sense of both briskness and substance.""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is cheeky without being too obnoxiously cutesy. While the look of it is medieval, the vibe seems more current, yet it's not so anachronistic as to be self-referential and subversive along the lines of a ""Shrek,"" for example. In that regard, it actually ends up being pleasingly old- fashioned.Shot in 3-D  rather than one of those muddled 2-D re-dos  the film looks crisp and clean, much more so than the trailers and ads might suggest. The action sequences are cut in an unobtrusive way so as to allow the intricacy of what's happening on screen to shine through. And once it bursts forth from the ground, the beanstalk itself is magnificent; enormous and richly detailed, it feels like a living, breathing and formidable thing.Tasked with climbing up this monstrosity is Nicholas Hoult, hot off the zombie romantic comedy ""Warm Bodies,"" as the title character. In staying mostly true to the story's origins, Jack is a poor farm boy whose uncle sends him on an errand to sell the family horse. Instead he comes back with  you guessed it  beans. But they're magic beans, so it's cool.While visiting the kingdom of Cloister that day, though, he also locks eyes briefly with a mysterious young woman. Turns out she's the princess, Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who has escaped her overprotective father (Ian McShane) in disguise to get a taste of what the real world is like. Her security detail, led by the loyal Elmont (Ewan McGregor), quickly whisks her away from Jack but they've clearly made a connection.A subsequent escape on a rainy night throws these two together again  but this time, one of those magical beans gets tragically wet. Boom  beanstalk, one that sends the princess high in the sky, all the way up to a long-forgotten land full of isolated and really angry giants.There aren't a whole lot of surprises here  if you know the story, you know what happens  although ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" features several inspired visuals, including an incredibly cool scene in which several beanstalks sprout in an unexpected direction. Hoult and Tomlinson are fine together  there's nothing outlandish about either of their performances  and they have a nice chemistry with each other.And they make room for some of the showier performances amid the strong supporting cast, including Stanley Tucci as the duplicitous Roderick, whom the king initially believes is an ideal husband for his precious daughter but who quickly reveals his untrustworthiness and hunger for power.And speaking of scenery chewing, these giants are fearsome and fully realized creatures with the help of motion-capture technology, especially Bill Nighy as their sadistic, two-headed leader. These are not bumbling behemoths but rather nimble warriors with a taste for blood who put the fright back into fee-fi-fo-fum.JACK THE GIANT SLAYER 3 starsCast: Nicholas Hoult, Ewan McGregor, Eleanor Tomlinson, Ian McShane, Stanley TucciDirector: Bryan Singer117 minutesRated PG-13 (intense scenes of fantasy action violence, some frightening images and brief language)"\u000a

V"It always means something to Chris Nixon when he faces Nevada Union High School in football.NU is the Elk Grove coach's alma mater, and his father, Marshall, coached the Miners in the 1970s and early 80s with playoff success.Nixon's top-ranked Thundering Herd hosts the No. 3 Miners tonight in a nonleague showdown of traditional wing-T powers. Nevada Union can run with power and deception and can pass with quarterback Kyle Cota and wide receiver Ian Davis. Cota has thrown for 717 yards and 10 touchdowns with no interceptions. Davis has five touchdowns. The Miners average 179 yards passing and 168 rushing.The Miners also sport a tough defense that includes linebackers Hank Humphers and Tanner Vallejo.Last season, Elk Grove beat NU 23-7 in Grass Valley. The Miners seek redemption as they make a run at the program's fifth Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship since 1993.""NU is definitely fast and physical,"" Nixon said. ""The linebacking core is the best we've seen, and nobody has been able to stop Cota and Davis. I'd put them on my fantasy football team if I had time to have one.""Last year's win was a lot of fun, but we still consider ourselves the underdogs in this game. Last year was the only time any player on our roster had beaten NU.""Elk Grove's offense features running backs Robert Frazier (523 yards, seven touchdowns) and Wadus Parker (407 yards, eight TDs). The Herd averages 339 rushing yards and has scored 20 touchdowns on the ground. Quarterback Tommy Arnold has passed for just two touchdowns, but both went for more than 60 yards.""We've played Elk Grove almost every season of my 29 years at Nevada Union, and it's always fun,"" coach Dave Humphers said. ""Right now, Elk Grove seems to have as good a team as it's ever had. Really, really good.""Cavaliere goes home  Coach Eric Cavaliere, whose No. 6 Oak Ridge Trojans play at Vacaville, also faces his alma mater.Cavaliere was a tight end and linebacker for the 1985 and '86 Bulldogs. He said he became a teacher and coach because of his mentor, the late Tom Zunino, who coached at Vacaville for 37 years.""Coach Z absolutely influenced me  the way I built my life as a teacher and coach with emphasis on family,"" Cavaliere said. ""I loved my days in Vacaville, and I always appreciated how truthful Z was with me, even if it hurt. He'd let you know if you underachieved. You wanted to please him. What a coach. He owned that town.""Et cetera  Franklin junior linebacker Joey Banks leads the area in tackles with 14.3 per game. Folsom wide receiver Phillip Carter, who averages 24.3 yards per catch and has six touchdown receptions, has received scholarship offers from San Jose State and Northern Arizona. Placer quarterback Peter Denham has verbally committed to Northern Arizona.  PLAYER OF THE WEEKMarcus Green of Franklin High School isn't just the Wildcats' most physical defensive back. He's their best cover man, too. The senior had three interceptions and eight tackles in Franklin's 23-3 victory over rival Cosumnes Oaks last Friday. He was voted The Bee's Prep Football Player of the Week on sacbee.com. No. 2 Franklin (4-0) hosts Jesuit at Cosumnes Oaks tonight. Joe Davidson"\u000a

V"The Sacramento Jewish Film Festival will highlight the documentary ""Hava Nagila (The Movie)"" the way countless bar mitzvahs and weddings have highlighted the song itself.The song's joyful melody has made it a staple at celebrations, and its ubiquity has given it shorthand status in American popular culture. It takes only a few notes of ""Hava"" on a movie soundtrack, for example, to immediately suggest ""Jewish.""""Hava"" filmmaker Roberta Grossman heard the song all her life but did not know its origins until researching her wry, informative documentary, which screens at 3 p.m. March 10 at the Crest Theatre. (The 16th Sacramento Jewish Film Festival runs Thursday and March 9-10 at the Crest.)""I grew up in a religiously assimilated but strongly Jewish-identified family in Los Angeles,"" Grossman said by phone this week. ""The moments at weddings and bar mitzvahs where everybody would get up to dance (to 'Hava') were really powerful for a kid. It felt very tribal and very Jewish.""And maybe even ancient, though the song is not. ""Hava Nagila,"" the title of which translates from Hebrew as ""let us rejoice,"" derives from a worldless nigun, or religious song, from the 18th century Hasidic movement in eastern Europe. The nigun that would become ""Hava"" moved to Palestine with eastern European settlers, and lyrics were written to accompany its music in 1918.""I was surprised by how young the song is, and I was really surprised that it had been there at so many key moments in Jewish history,"" Grossman said.The film traces the song's connection to the postwar migration of city-dwelling Jewish Americans to the suburbs. In the suburbs, synagogues and a desire to rejoice grew bigger, partly in response to the horrors experienced by Jewish people during World War II.""Hava"" found mass popularity during the same period via recordings by Harry Belafonte and Connie Francis, among others. Grossman interviews them both in her film.""Hava"" plays, in various musical incarnations, throughout the documentary. Having listened to the song almost constantly for the past few years, does Grossman still want to jump up to dance the hora when she hears it?""Right now, I want to run from it,"" she said. ""Actually, it is more meaningful to me now than it used to be."" When Grossman's daughter was bat mitzvahed last summer, the crowd kept with tradition and held her aloft, seated in a chair as the band performed ""Hava Nagila.""""My family felt like, 'Oh, they are playing our song,' "" Grossman said.The Sacramento Jewish Film Festival, usually a weekendlong event, adds a Thursday screening this year to its Saturday and Sunday programs.""Deaf Jam,"" a documentary about a deaf Israeli teenager who becomes an American Sign Language slam poet in Queens, N.Y., shows at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. ""Deaf Jam,"" presented in ASL and English with English subtitles, ""is very energetic and youthful, so we thought it would be a good choice for Thursday night,"" said Sid Garcia-Heberger, Jewish Film Festival co- director (with Margi Park) and Crest Theatre general manager.The Thursday screening is meant to attract first-time festivalgoers, thereby augmenting the Jewish Film Festival's loyal existing audience.""Our attendance is rock solid, and we are very grateful for that, but we want to kick into growth mode again,"" Garcia-Heberger said.The festival's Saturday-night feature (7:30, March 9) is an Israeli narrative film called ""The Matchmaker."" It involves a mysterious Holocaust survivor who ""finds people who are a little less than empirically perfect"" to pair romantically, Garcia Heberger said.The art-world documentary ""Portrait of Wally"" will screen at 1 p.m. March 10, before ""Hava Nagila."" The Nazis seized ""Wally,"" a 1912 portrait by Austrian artist Egon Schiele, in 1939, and the painting's tumultuous history does not end there.""It plays like a suspense film,"" Garcia-Heberger said.SACRAMENTO JEWISH FILM FESTIVALWhen: ""Deaf Jam,"" 7:30 p.m. Thursday; ""The Matchmaker,"" 7:30 p.m. March 9; ""Portrait of Wally"" 1 p.m. March 10; ""Hava Nagila (The Movie)"" 3 p.m. March 10Where: Crest Theatre, 1013 K St., SacramentoCost: $10.50 for each film ($9.50 seniors and students, $8.50 for groups of 20 or more).

For state-ranked No. 16 Sheldon (12-4), it was the Huskies' first win in three attempts on their home court against a major state power.The Huskies lost to Salesian of Richmond 63-61 last February and 71-65 to Archbishop Mitty of San Jose in December. Mitty is state-ranked No. 10 and Salesian No. 15 by Maxpreps.com.""I think this was our breakthrough game,"" said Manning, Sheldon's unsung 6-foot-6 senior forward who had a career high 29 points and grabbed six rebounds. ""We needed to get over the hump. It's also nice to do it in our home gym. It's a completely different atmosphere than when we travel. We get a lot more fired up at home.""Manning himself was on fire. He made 11 of 16 shots from the field, including five three-pointers, four of which came in the second quarter, three in the span of little more than a minute as Sheldon took a big early lead.""Ryan shot the ball really well for us,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said. ""Ryan is really a wing, but he has to play out of position for us and power up against the big guys, which really isn't his game.""Williams, a senior point guard who spent most of the day in bed with the food poisoning, scored 15 points, including three driving, left-handed runners in traffic to hold off a Bullard team that twice closed to within six points late in the game.Williams also had eight rebounds and five assists.""He woke up a half-hour before the game,"" Rollings said. ""He struggled a little at the start but did a really good job at the end.""Darin Johnson added 15 points and five rebounds and Dakarai Allen 13 points, four assists and three blocks.Corey Silverstrom led Bullard with 26 points.The game was a matchup of programs with a lot of similarities.Both have ambitious coaches with up-tempo philosophies. They have gifted players, balance, depth and a whatever-doesn't-kill-us-only-makes-us-stronger mentality.Both also are public schools matching drop-steps with the state's best private school programs.Sheldon is trying to win a fourth consecutive Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship. Bullard is going after a third consecutive Central Section D-I championship.Last season Bullard lost 85-66 to national power Mater Dei of Santa Ana in the CIF Southern Regional D-I championship game. Mater Dei then beat Sheldon 66-48 in a D-I state championship battle at Sleep Train Arena.""We always want to compete at a high level and compete with the best in the state,"" said Bullard coach Tony Amundsen, a former Pacific player. ""That's why we schedule Sheldon. The kids need to see all the best teams so they can see what they need to work on. Ultimately you are preparing for the end of the year."""\u000a

V"Saturday night was festive for Christian Brothers High School baseball.While the Falcons battled top-ranked Jesuit in extra innings in the nightcap of the Albie Swingin' For Life showcase in front of a large crowd at Sacramento City College, the La Salle Club celebrated the 50th anniversary of CBS' greatest team.The 1962 team, then known as Bishop Armstrong, went 22-2 under coach Dick Sperbeck and lost to the Stanford freshman team that started Jim Lonborg, who went on to win a Cy Young Award with the Red Sox. Jim Fox led the region in hitting that year, and Larry Marietti, Mike Green and Cal Boyer combined for 13 shutouts.Fox is the father of Andy Fox, a CBS slugging star in the late 1980s and a teammate of Bo Dodson, who once famously clubbed a homer onto the CBS tennis courts.Dodson's son, Hunter, is now a CBS senior infielder. With his father watching, Hunter had four hits in a 6-5 loss to No. 1 Jesuit on Saturday. CBS debuts in The Bee rankings at No. 13, trailing No. 9 Bella Vista in the Capital Valley Conference.Dodson is hitting .411 with 19 RBIs. Brandon Hunley has 17 RBIs. Pitchers Jared Cottini, Jeff Johnston and Lucas Still have combined for 10 wins.Facing Kennedy, Hunley hit the first home run at CBS' renovated field last month, depositing the ball over a newly installed outfield fence. In a ceremony to usher in the new facility, Hunley presented his home run ball to school officials so it can be placed in CBS' trophy case.Around the diamonds  Ponderosa started to celebrate what it thought was a 10-9 victory over Jesuit in a Delta River League game Friday after losing the previous two games to the Marauders by a combined 16-0. With no scoreboard, Jesuit coaches quickly pointed out in their scorebook that the Marauders had scored 10 runs, and Ponderosa agreed. So the game went into extra innings, and Jesuit prevailed 11-10. Pleasant Grove's Zack Stilwell tossed a perfect game with 13 strikeouts in a 3-0 win over Ponderosa on Monday. J.Q. Folena homered for the Eagles. In steady rain, No. 3 Elk Grove scored three times in the seventh inning at No. 7 Franklin to take a 10-9 lead in a Delta Valley Conference game Wednesday. The Thundering Herd had runners on base when the umpires called the game. The game, per the rules, reverted to the last completed inning, and Franklin was declared a 9-7 winner. The game's first danger sign came in the sixth inning, when Elk Grove's Rowdy Tellez swung and his bat sailed over the fence beyond the visitors' dugout, scattering the crowd. Cal-bound right-hander Ryan Mason struck out 12, including the final eight, and A.J. Sanchez homered in Placer's 2-0 win over Bear River on Friday. Mason walked none and allowed two hits. Placer plays rival Lincoln twice this week in Pioneer Valley League action. No. 2 Davis will host Elk Grove on Wednesday and start ace Ben Eckels, who struck out eight their last meeting. No. 11 River Valley and No. 12 Yuba City will play a three-game series beginning today to decide the Tri-County Conference title. River Valley opened in 2005 in Yuba City, and the Honkers seek their eighth straight league title.  THE BEE'S TOP 20Records through Sunday:PR  previous rankingsTeam Rec. PR 1. Jesuit 16-5 1 2.

V"""Argo"" (R, 120 minutes, Warner Home Video): This captivating, expertly machined political thriller is serious and substantive, an ingeniously written and executed drama fashioned from a fascinating, little-known chapter of recent history. Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez, a CIA expert in disguises and ""exfiltration,"" who at the height of the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 is called on to get six American diplomats out of Tehran, where they've been hiding in the Canadian ambassador's residence. His scheme is so crazy, it just might work: He'll impersonate a movie producer who arrives in Iran to scout locations for his upcoming science-fiction flick. After some legerdemain with paperwork and spending a day or two chatting up the new revolutionary government's cultural ministers, he'll depart with the Americans in tow, each of them playing someone on the film's crew. Working from a well-crafted script by Chris Terrio, Affleck (who also directs) threads viewers through the dauntingly tricky geopolitics and tonal shifts with an utterly flawless sense of control. Contains profanity and some violent images. ""Anna Karenina"" (R, 130 minutes, Universal): In a jewel box of a theater, the curtain goes up, the music swells and the camera itself swoons as the players take their places in Joe Wright's ingenious, intoxicating adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's novel, in which the dense tale of love, adultery, politics and aristocratic manners has been brilliantly re-imagined as light opera. Wright stages ""Anna"" (played by Keira Knightley) with equal parts precision, playfulness and passion as a lively tableau vivant gradually gives way to tragic waltz.

V"Faced with tough re-elections and constituents clamoring for government services, Republican governors in some big swing states are turning pragmatic, pulling away from the conservative line that helped them win in 2010.The clearest sign of the shift comes from seven Republican governors who have agreed to expand the Medicaid program, a key feature of President Barack Obamas health care law that some bitterly opposed when winning their seats.But the governors are learning, as their predecessors did, that voters tend to judge them on how well they manage government, not how eloquently they articulate political theory. They insist they are not being politically expedient. I dont see an ideological shift. Were going through a detailed analysis of whether this is right, and the health care law is the law of the land, said Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who is undecided about Medicaid expansion.The shiftswhich also feature softening stands on immigration, voting rights and other issues--are a big topic at this weekends National Governors Association winter session. The governors will meet with Obama at the White House Monday. Administration officials were at Sundays session talking about health care options privately with governors.Republicans Monday could offer the president two different messages, a split that reflects the turmoil the party is enduring after losing the White House as well as congressional seats.Some are likely to show unwavering fealty to the conservative cause. Others are probably going to talk more pragmatically.The governors of Florida, Ohio, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and North Dakota have agreed to expand the Medicaid program in their states. Some other Republicans are studying it. Medicaid is the joint federal-state health care program for lower-income people, and the administration argues that its growth will help cut the rolls of the uninsured.Nothing motivated the Republican base in 2010 like opposition to Obamas health care plan. The reason we all fought against the Affordable Care Act is we were doing a lot of things ourselves, said Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, who is studying whether to accept the expansion. We wanted to retain flexibility. That people in Washington were making decisions, rather than the people in Boise, is something I was rejecting.Florida Gov. Rick Scott was one of the more outspoken foes, branding the health care plan a job killer.Last week, the sharp edge was gone. It doesnt matter what I believe. It doesnt matter what anybody believes. The Supreme Courts already made their decision. We had an election in the fall. The public made their decision. Thats the law, he said last week in Florida. If a state accepts, the federal government will pay the full costs of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries for three years starting in 2014. After that, the percentage will gradually drop to 90 percent, which some fear would dump massive costs on states.That change wouldnt occur until after the 2014 election, though, and most of the Medicaid-supporting governors are running in states Obama carried in 2012. They include Scott, Ohios John Kasich, Michigans Rick Snyder, New Mexicos Susana Martinez, and Nevadas Brian Sandoval. Also opting in are Arizonas Jan Brewer, who cant run for another term, and North Dakotas John Dalrymple, who is not up until 2016. Other Republican governors, including those in Texas, South Carolina and North Carolina have not agreed to the Medicaid changes, while some are still deciding. Democrats understand why Republicans are warming to the plan. You have a chance to practice fiscal common sense, and thats more important than ideology, said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon maintains that by the time federal funding drops, the health care law will have helped trim costs and make systems more efficient.Governors who have accepted the Medicaid expansion insist politics is not driving their decisions, saying they have an obligation to help the needy and ease their states fiscal pain.Kasich maintained taking Medicaid money will help free other funds for mental health services. I cant look at the disabled, I cant look at the poor, I cant look at the mentally ill, I cant look at the addicted and think we ought to ignore them, he said.In Michigan, Snyder uses similar arguments.But Snyders action, like those of Scott, Kasich and others, also suggests a strategic move away from the right. Last year, Snyder vetoed health care legislation because it contained restrictions on abortions, and vetoed a Republican-backed measure to tighten the rules on voter identification at the polls.That did burnish his image as a practical governor, said Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics.Other governors are urging overhauls of the nations immigration system. And some are decrying federal budget cuts due to start taking effect Friday. Idahos Otter said theres been lots of discussion about an immigration plan, with Republican and western governors asking How can we be more positive? about welcoming immigrants into the country.These governors do face political risk. The conservative Ohio Liberty Coalition charged Kasich is caving on Medicaid, and is now cozying up to the White House.Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, was on Scotts 2010 transition team. At the time, he got it. He got that Obamacare is not health care reform, Cannon said. There is no policy rationale now for him to do what hes done."\u000a

It might be best to avoid multiplexes altogether for the next two to four weeks, on the chance that you mix up theaters after a bathroom break and walk in when our heroes trick two pledges at an all-Latina sorority into making out with each other.Whether that sounds like good fun or a sign of the apocalypse will influence your ability to embrace this college party comedy, which treads heavily through ""Harold and Kumar"" territory with some new ground covered as well. The movie was directed by the writers of ""The Hangover,"" most likely conceived when they were younger and dumber but also more fearless. Combine that with a nothing-to-lose small budget filled mostly with little-known actors, and the result is uncompromising comedy.""21 and Over"" sets the crude tone early, opening with our heroes Miller and Casey (Miles Teller and Skylar Astin) looking defeated, walking across a college quad wearing nothing but athletic socks covering their genitals. Flash back one day, when the pair surprise high school friend Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) on his 21st birthday.Chang has a strict father and a medical school interview the next morning, but he goes out any way. Most of the movie follows Miller and Casey on a quest to get their unresponsive, hallucinating friend back to his apartment before his father shows up.Young parents in the audience may be wondering why no one dials 911  in real life, Jeff would have died tragically four or five times. Just as those parents' parents probably thought the panty raid in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" should have resulted in felony arrests. ""21 and Over"" requires a suspension of both disbelief and the moral high ground.But once you accomplish those tasks, there are many rewards. Writer-directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore find a nice balance between the over-the-top high jinks and an emotional core that unexpectedly crystallizes relatively late in the movie. When the 18-year-olds who love this movie grow up, it might still mean something to them.What looks like a simple journey is given ""Odyssey""-like significance by the writers. A quest to find a residential adviser at a party has allusions to Dante's nine circles of hell and ""Apocalypse Now."" Chang's scene telling off the college town's various bouncers is an excellent use of montage. Throwaway jokes about Smart Cars, ""Rocky IV"" and oversize music festivals ring true.Teller, who excelled in a smaller role in the underrated 2011 ""Footloose"" remake, is the standout. He possesses most of the better qualities of Jonah Hill and Ryan Reynolds, although too jumpy at times. (Future directors should monitor caffeine intake.) The weakest link is Casey's love interest, Nicole, who speaks and acts like a shallow man's ideal of a girlfriend  speaking in sexy repartee while rarely resembling a real human being. Much of this movie's dilemma could be quickly solved with a smartphone  was the script written before that technology? And if you are bothered by 32-year-old actors playing 21, know that there appears to be more than one 11th-year senior in this movie.If there's a weighty question in ""21 and Over,"" it's ""are Miller and Casey the best friends ever or the worst friends ever?"" Somewhere between the scene with slow motion puking and naked ritual branding, you'll forget you even asked.21 AND OVER3 starsCast: Miles Teller, Skylar Astin and Justin Chon Directors: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore93 minutesRated R "\u000a

""It would have been so easy for our guys (to be deflated) after our leader goes down. But we rallied.""And No. 3 Antelope (25-6) rallied against a No. 4 Grant team (23-7) that competed as if it had nothing to lose.Antelope didn't have a lot of answers for De'Sean Parsons, Grant's terrific all-around 6-6 senior guard, but then again, that's been the case for everyone this season in dealing with one of the section's top talents. Parsons scored 27 points and had eight rebounds, but the Titans challenged him in the second half. They stalled him down the stretch and seized control.Antelope's Rashard Thornhill hit a corner three-pointer after his teammates worked the ball for a 69-61 lead with 55 seconds left to effectively end Grant's hopes.Though Ellis is of star material, what makes Antelope so complete as a unit  and so dangerous  is it has a supporting cast capable of a Northern California championship run.Forward Gabe Bealer scored 24 points and had seven rebounds, soaring for dunks and powering inside. Football star Tyler Winston was effective at guard, scoring eight points with a game-high five assists. Thornhill, a 6-3 guard, had 14 points and six rebounds.Isiah Quintero had seven points and eight rebounds, Leonard Hazewood, Nick Golovko and Mister Harriel also contributed to the victory.""Defense and toughness, I mean, come on, he goes down after he was so dominant,"" Richards said of Ellis. ""Hard to lose him. We played great defense in the second half. That's our trademark, and this was a true team effort.""Said Bealer, ""I had to step up for Isaiah; we all did.""Grant has fielded 32 playoff teams, winning its first section title in 1977.Antelope is still growing as a school and developing into an athletic power.It sent its first varsity team to Sleep Train two seasons ago, where it stunned top-seeded Woodcreek in a semifinal before losing to St. Mary's of Stockton in the final, and then beat Lodi in last season's title game.The Titans are 11-1 in section playoff games under Richards.""I couldn't be more proud,"" Richards said. ""It's a burden that they're good and that we're here, but they've handled it really well.""Antelope and Grant both advance to the Northern California Regional playoffs that start next week. Antelope could earn a top-two seed today in the D-II field as it appears to be a long shot for the newly formed Open division for elite programs that have won three or more section titles in a row, or have similar NorCal credentials."\u000a

Magic, once a staple of Nevada entertainment, has evolved. Even David Copperfield is a bit of an anachronism.Where does that leave Kevin and Caruso, the leads of the Eldorado's new ""Magique?"" In their own niche, a bit of the glamour and glitz, a bit of the dark side. Unlike other magic teams, they come across as a mismatched pair, Kevin with an ordinary-guy look and attitude, Caruso (called ""Lord Caruso"" in a bit of silliness) more dandified. They work together well onstage because of this and also because they avoid foolish banter and even stay away from letting anybody know much about them  just two guys performing magic.Therein lies much of the joy of ""Magique."" There is none of the business that makes so many shows tedious. There is no explanation of what is about to happen, except for one well-placed comment about a variation on Houdini's famous ""Metamorphosis.""

V"On the heels of a year in which an amazing number of movies portrayed American military, intelligence and political processes without an ounce of cynicism, where can a filmmaker turn for refreshed inspiration? Russia, of course! ""Phantom,"" Todd Robinson's intriguing, if uneven, thriller, dusts off an obscure chapter in Cold War-era brinkmanship, made all the more piquant by the fact that the participants, in this case, were compatriots. The action begins in 1968, when a Soviet submarine captain named Demi (Ed Harris), who's about to retire, receives one last commission  on a wheezing, clanking rust bucket that still runs on diesel fuel at the dawn of the all-nuclear age. Along with his executive officer, Alex (William Fichtner), Demi welcomes a few new crew members to their cramped quarters and the enigmatic mission. The crew includes a strangely watchful technician named Bruni (David Duchovny), who seems to know Demi from somewhere.That mystery, along with Demi's haunted past and the growing sense that he has been sent on a ghost mission, gives ""Phantom"" a compelling frisson, made even more palpable as the true nature of the sub's maneuvers comes to light. Filmed in a real-life Russian submarine docked in San Diego, the movie possesses a cramped, humid sense of verisimilitude, giving viewers vicarious claustrophobia as the vessel plunges down, down, down.That admirable air of realism dissipates once Robinson takes viewers outside the sub, where torpedo skirmishes are staged with too-perfect CGI bombast. The filmmaker's decision to dispense with Russian accents effectively removes the kind of mannered affectation that too often plagues similar projects, but that choice is virtually canceled out by wince-inducing passages of cornball dialogue, incomprehensible techno-speak and stagey, theatrical pacing.Still, Harris lends volumes of mournful Slavic expressiveness to Demi, whose major pivot point occurs amid a shattering moment of self-awareness. His chemistry with Fichtner  given a welcome second-lead role here  feels spontaneous, instinctive and, in the film's magical realist final moments, genuinely loving.""Phantom"" isn't a cinematic masterpiece, but it tells an utterly fascinating story that turns America-first patriotism on its head. For a generation raised on Cold War paranoia, it will take some adjusting to root for the bad guy, who, in the course of faithfully serving a country not our own, just might have saved the world.PHANTOMTwo 1/2 starsCast: Ed Harris, William Fichtner, David DuchovnyDirector: Todd Robinson 97 minutesRated R (Contains violence)"\u000a

His suspected shooter, 30-year-old Humphrey Gascon, then turned the gun on himself.Tonn's death sent shock waves through his small department, a force of fewer than 40.Retired Chief Loren Cattolico, who hired Tonn, said he wept upon hearing of his death. He marveled at Tonn's commitment to the Galt Police Department despite opportunities to work at bigger, higher-paying departments in the region.""He wasn't interested in any of that,"" Cattolico said. ""He wanted to be in Galt. He wanted to be a part of the community.""Those who worked with Tonn described him as a hard worker and committed public servant who had a special interest in the town's youths.Bowen joked several times about Tonn's prized ""K-9 cards""  much like baseball cards  on which Tonn boasted goals of getting guns off the streets and ""taking bad guys to jail.""He told a story about a group of Girl Scouts who recently visited the Police Department. Tonn spoke to the group and waited patiently as each girl stopped to pet Yaro. Each one got a K-9 card and a demonstration of Yaro's latest trick  opening the patrol car door with his snout.An emotional Bowen spoke of other fallen officers  some of them friends of Bowen's  welcoming Tonn to heaven, and then broke the tension by joking that Tonn's first question would be, ""Where's the K-9 unit?""Tonn was, after all, a jokester, his friends recalled, a man full of antics and humor. But even more, Tonn was remembered for his strong moral code and his desire to serve others. He believed being a police officer was a higher calling than any other, his loved ones said, and getting sworn in to the Galt Police Department  where he would join his cousin  was a lifelong goal.Raised in the Sacramento region by parents Will and Mary Ann Tonn, Kevin joined the Roseville Police Explorers program as a teen. After graduating from Roseville High, he joined the U.S. Army as a military police officer at New York's Fort Drum. He later worked as a firefighter  first volunteer, then full-time  before he returned home to California.He put himself through the Sacramento County Sheriff's Academy in 2009 and was sworn in to the Galt Police Department that fall.Retired Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness did not know Tonn personally, but reflected on a challenge he gave Tonn's academy class  to build upon and improve the law enforcement profession.By all accounts, McGinness said, Tonn took that mission seriously and succeeded.""You knew what was right, and you did it,"" he said, speaking to Tonn. ""You left the law enforcement and its reputation better than you found it. RIP, Comrade.""Cattolico said Tonn demonstrated a ""natural ease"" in police work that ""not everyone has,"" and said he was the type of police officer any chief would want to hire.""He served this community with honesty, integrity and unwavering commitment,"" Cattolico said.He read a letter from a man Tonn had arrested for drunken driving in which the man thanked Tonn for his professionalism and for forcing him to deal with his demons.""Please take care of yourself,"" the man's letter ended. ""Be careful out there.""""Kevin Tonn lived a life that mattered,"" Cattolico said after finishing the letter. ""He touched all our lives, and we are all better for it.""As is customary at any law enforcement funeral, dignitaries and officers from all over California came to honor Tonn. This service, however, drew a remarkable contingent of K-9 officers and their partners, who restlessly lined the sidewalks outside Adventure Christian Church, and later the rows of East Lawn Mortuary in Citrus Heights.There, officers conducted full military and law enforcement honors, including the playing of bagpipes, a 21-gun salute and a helicopter fly-by.For many, the events culminated a week of sadness and grief. But an emotional and impassioned Jarrett Tonn had a different take on his cousin's death.""It is sad, and it is awful, but it is not a tragedy,"" he said. ""Giving one's life to protect others is never a tragedy.""Kevin knew that, he believed that, and he lived that until his final breath.""MEMORIAL FUND FOR OFFICER KEVIN TONNA memorial fund has been set up for Officer Kevin Tonn at Premier West Bank, 9340 E. Stockton Blvd., Elk Grove, 95624. The account number is 82804382."\u000a

V"When 16-year-old Kayla Ham arrived at Capitol Mall early Sunday before the Kaiser Permanente Women's Fitness Festival, her goal was to complete her first 5K run. After jogging across the finish line holding hands with her stepmother, Brittany Ham, and family friend Liz Delgado, Kayla said she was excited to sign up for another race.""I wanted to get in shape and be healthy,"" said Kayla, a high school student from Folsom who began running this year at the encouragement of her stepmother.They were three of the about 4,100 participants  a record for the event  who registered for the run and walk that began on Ninth Street near Capitol Mall, circled through midtown and finished on 10th Street in front of the state Capitol.After the walk and run, women  many dressed in the official hot-pink Nike race shirt  proceeded up the west steps of the Capitol to have their body composition tested and to learn how to do breast self-exams in the Kaiser Thrive Pavilion. Some received massages from the 30 therapists in the Recovery Zone, and enjoyed yogurt parfaits and fresh fruit including locally grown strawberries from the Whole Foods Market.""It's encouraging to see women taking control of their lives with their husbands and families out here supporting them,"" said Mo Bartley, a race assistant and a coach with the Fleet Feet trail training program that began four years ago.Brittany Ham and her husband, Mark Ham, who took photographs of his wife and daughter, began running through a Fleet Feet program. In Sacramento, Fleet Feet has trained 3,000 people, and the store produced the eighth annual women's race.""We went from not being able to run a mile to running a marathon in a year,"" said Brittany Ham, adding that they joined the training program to get healthier.The couple completed the California International Marathon in December and plan to run the race again this year.Lisa Riley, director of training programs, said demand for them has increased since the first was offered in 2004. While Fleet Feet Sacramento's customer base is about 63 percent female, Riley said women make up roughly 70 percent of the training program participants.""Women are joiners,"" Riley explained.A record high of more than 7 million females completed road races in 2011, according to a report on the growth of women's running by the nonprofit organization Running USA. The report states that there were more than 200 races with more than 95 percent female finishers in 2011  race events such as Sunday's Women's Fitness Festival.Ryan Lamppa, a researcher for Running USA, said new female participants have driven a second boom in running since the mid-1990s.""In the early 80s, about 10 percent of the fields were female. Now it is approaching 55 percent,"" Lamppa said.He attributed that growth to the long-term social changes encouraged since the enactment Title IX in 1972, the accessibility of training programs on the Internet, and the increased awareness of running with both Oprah Winfrey's completion of the 1994 Marine Corps Marathon and the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure.""The sport is less intimidating and more mainstream,"" said Lamppa.Sunday race participant and elite masters runner Barbara Miller of Modesto said she has watched the sport change since she began running in 1983. Miller, 72, won her age group in 23:47.5 and said she finished seconds off her goal of setting an American record.""Running has become social and more women have gotten into it for the social and health movement,"" said Miller after completing her fifth consecutive festival race.Fleet Feet-sponsored racer and former Oregon State University runner Hayley Oveson, 24, of Sacramento won the race, crossing the finish line in 17:39.5, over a minute ahead of the second-place finisher.Blue Diamond Almonds presented the festival; proceeds from the event benefit WEAVE, or Women Escaping a Violent Environment.Editor's Note: This article has been changed from the print version to correct the spelling of Ryan Lamppa's name.

V"Angela Jeter-Hall sometimes plays the bad cop.""She has trouble saying no,"" Jeter-Hall says of her athletically gifted daughter Devlyn Jeter, a senior soccer player at Rosemont High School. ""She wanted to play basketball again this season, and I had to put my foot down and say no.""As one of the area's top soccer players and a University of Portland scholarship signee, Jeter's schedule is packed with high-mileage matches, training sessions and practices.It's especially demanding during the spring when she plays simultaneously for Rosemont and two competitive club teams while also attending training sessions as part of the United States Soccer Federation's Under-18 national player development pool.""I worry all the time about her,"" said Jeter-Hall, who was a standout softball player at Cordova and Sacramento State in the late 1980s and early 1990s. ""I know she wanted to finish her senior year with a bang, but she tries to do too much. Her body gets worn out.""Last year, Jeter played in only five games for Rosemont because of a right knee injury suffered during an Olympic Development Program training session. It required surgery to repair.Some high-level area players have quit the high school girls game because of the physical demands, overlapping schedules and lower quality of competition.The USSF, in a much-debated decision, already has forced its high-level ""academy"" boys players to choose between club and high school. They no longer can play both.Jeter admits she has mixed feelings about her decision to complete her four-year varsity career at Rosemont.""Club is more like a job,"" said Jeter, a longtime Elk Grove United club standout, ""so playing high school is more fun and a chance to play with friends and my cousin (Ivy Patterson, a senior midfielder). I also want to win a league title real bad. I felt this was our year.""But that was before the season.Jeter strained her groin more than three weeks ago during a club training session and has been hobbled since.As Jeter has physically struggled, so have the Wolverines.Rosemont is 0-3-1 in its past four matches  Jeter played only against front-runners McClatchy and Kennedy  and is battling Burbank and Sacramento High for the Metro Conference's third and final playoff spot.""From time to time, it goes through the back of my head I shouldn't be playing (high school) so close to going off to Portland,"" Jeter said. ""But I made a commitment, and once I do that, I'm in start to finish.""Rosemont coach Sal Alcocer is impressed with Jeter's loyalty to the Wolverines.The lean, 6-foot-1 forward/midfielder has played in 12 of Rosemont's 18 matches, scoring 14 goals with 11 assists.""When she can play, she does a lot of good things,"" Alcocer said. ""She's a great leader, very patient with those who aren't up to her level.""But sometimes her teammates become spectators, thinking they don't have to do as much because Devlyn's going to bail us out.""She won't have to bail out Portland, although her ability to play several positions is welcomed by coach Garrett Smith.""DJ is the type of player that will immediately catch your eye just by her presence on the field,"" Smith said upon Jeter's signing. ""She's very athletic. We have seen her play from the high school level to the national team level, covering almost every position on the field.""Portland has been a women's soccer power for years. The program's strong fan support  the school does not have a football team  and the small class sizes are two reasons Jeter chose the 3,800-student Catholic school in Oregon over Stanford and Santa Clara.""I don't like a school where you meet a new person and then don't see them for a month,"" said Jeter, who aspires to work for the FBI. ""I like a lot of teacher attention.""Not lost on Jeter is she will follow in the cleats of three former Elk Grove United players  Stephanie (Lopez) Cox, and Megan and Rachael Rapinoe. Cox and Megan Rapinoe are now mainstays of the U.S. Women's National Team.Jeter has twice attended Cox's Elk Grove training camps and has followed the defender's career, though star national team forward Abby Wambach remains Jeter's favorite player.""She thought it was so cool to be trained by Stephanie, and now to be going to the same school,"" Jeter-Hall said. ""Her dream is to one day follow in Stephanie's footsteps and maybe even play left back on the national team."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/11/5181885/stoppage-time-how-about-a-little.html,"May 13, 2012 is a day that not only Manchester City fans, but soccer fans in general won't soon forget.It was the day that City ended its lengthy title drought with a dramatic 3-2 win over QPR on the final day of the season as the Citizens scored two goals in stoppage time to snatch the title away from bitter rivals Manchester United.The scenes that followed were memorable as City celebrated with unbridled euphoria, which was matched by the despair on the faces of the United players and fans.It was the perfect storm of events as two giants of the English game spent the previous nine months jockeying for position at the top of the league, only for the title to literally be decided in the final seconds of the season.Sort of like the New York City Marathon ending with a 50-yard sprint to the finish line.A scenario like this does not often occur in other sports, which have a postseason tournament to follow the regular season, allowing for teams to do enough to get into the playoffs and hope they get hot at the right time.In soccer, if you fall too far behind the lead pack, you get left behind.And while this setup places greater emphasis on the importance of each game, it also leaves open the possibility of one team running away with the league and turning the final month into little more than a victory lap.If you take one look around the top leagues in Europe, it looks like victory laps are in the future of more than a few teams.This past weekend is not one that will live long in the memory, but it is one that saw the lead dog pull a little further away from the pack in most leagues and make us come to the realization that what we saw last May won't be duplicated again this season.Prior to the start of the weekend, Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini said it would be ""easy"" to make up the nine-point deficit on Manchester United that his club faced because they would close this current campaign out much the same way they did last term, with six successive wins to end the season.But after watching his team lose 3-1 at bottom-half Southampton on Saturday in a game that saw City commit two terrible blunders, including an own goal from Gareth Barry that saw him expertly finish a cross from the wing into his own net, Mancini has changed his tune.United's 2-0 win over Everton on Sunday saw the gap widen to 12 points, and even Mancini acknowledges that the prospects of overturning this deficit are slim, saying ""12 points is too much at this moment.""But Mancini is not alone.Borussia Dortmund has won the last two Bundesliga titles and appeared to be headed for another showdown with perennial heavyweight Bayern Munich this season.However, Bayern has toyed with the rest of the league, and the club's 4-0 win over Schalke this weekend, combined with Dortmund's disappointing 4-1 home defeat against Hamburg, leaves the Bavarians 15 points clear at the top of the league.Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp gave up on the title race following his team's latest defeat, and he has now turned his ambitions to other competitions.""It is not possible to win the league, it is easy mathematics,"" Klopp said. ""We now have 14 games left which leaves 42 points. We would have to get all 42 and they (Bayern) would have to only get 30. That is not possible, not with this Bayern Munich team.""Things aren't much different in Spain either as Barcelona stretched its lead to 12 points over second-place Atletico Madrid on Sunday, leaving the Catalans to basically coast through the final 15 games en route to their fourth La Liga title in five years.The only question in Spain now is whether Real Madrid will overtake Atletico for second place.Doesn't quite move the needle, does it?Even in Serie A and Ligue 1, where Juventus and PSG own five and six-point leads respectively, does there appear to be a legitimate threat to the crown.Juventus moved five points above second-place Napoli over the weekend and is simply a deeper side that is set up better for the stretch run, despite the potential distraction that playing in the knockout round of the Champions League could become.PSG has continued to spend money and is superior to every other Ligue 1 side in terms of talent, and the club seems to have overcome its early-season malaise to win eight of its last nine games and open up a six-point lead.Certainly there is time for some of these races to become more interesting, but if this past weekend is any indication, the gap is only growing.This is not to suggest that the remaining three-plus months of the season will be devoid of interest.The battle for European places is a big deal in terms of financial ramifications, as is the annual fight for survival.Relegation battles are entertaining because it brings out the most primal instincts of a club, when anything that can help a team stay in the top flight is encouraged.But there is no substitute for a down-to-the-wire title race in terms of drama, glory and heartbreak.Those elements are things we hope every soccer season will deliver.Unfortunately, it looks like this year those elements are in short supply."\u000a

V"A dramatic expansion of a ski resort in the community of Homewood on Lake Tahoe's west shore has been blocked by a Sacramento federal judge.U.S. District Judge William B. Shubb ruled that Placer County and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency sidestepped laws governing the project when they approved a plan that fails to consider a smaller facility.In a 114-page opinion issued Friday, Shubb said that a combined environmental impact report and environmental impact statement appears to skew the financial outlook of the resort's proposed expansion by failing to consider all streams of income.Consequently, the judge did not buy the arguments of the resort's owners and a developer that a less ambitious expansion would make the venture fiscally unsound.Attorneys for the resort owner and its developers  Homewood Village Resorts, LLC and JMA Ventures, LLC  and the county and TRPA could not be reached Monday.The group has faced a coalition of conservationists and Homewood residents who have pushed for a smaller project at the Homewood Mountain Resort, and ultimately sued the business interests behind the proposed expansion and the government agencies that signed off on it.Coalition members hailed Shubb's ruling as a vindication of their efforts to protect the beauty and clarity of the lake and the integrity of the scenic basin in which it sits.Homewood was developed around 1900 as a vacation resort. It is mainly a rustic residential community, with approximately 900 residents.The resort, opened in 1962, is primarily a ""day ski"" area because it has no overnight accommodations. Therefore, it attracts very few midweek, multiday skiers.The resort is currently operating at a significant loss because of its inability to compete with the larger facilities in the region. The proposed project was designed to remedy that.But, while data supplied by the developer and a consultant include projected profits from increased lift ticket sales, the data ""are bereft of projections of the profits that the resort's other"" features will contribute, Shubb said.""Without such comparative data, the economic feasibility of the reduced alternative (known as alternative 6) is unknown beyond the obvious conclusion that it would be less profitable,"" the judge wrote. ""Accordingly, the county's finding that alternative 6 is economically infeasible is not supported by substantial evidence.""Since the project's environmental report relies on the faulty data, its ""analysis of alternative 6 is inadequate"" under the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Shubb stated.For the same reason, he said, the environmental report is ""also inadequate"" under the Congress-approved Nevada-California compact that governs TRPA's actions on construction around the lake.The compact requires an environmental impact statement to ""(s)tudy, develop and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action for any project which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.The data at issue said the ski resort needs to increase midweek ticket sales by an average of 400 in order to generate sustainable revenues and, at minimum, cover operating costs.Alternative 6 would reduce the number of proposed tourist accommodations and residential units by approximately 15 percent  from 336 to 284.The proposed project, as it stands now, would bring in a projected $670,000 in increased annual revenue. The developer's consultant projects that amount would decrease by $127,609 if alternative 6 is implemented."\u000a

Here's a chronology of the race.9:52 am: Americans Daniel Tapia, Alisha Williams win California International MarathonAmericans Daniel Tapia and Alisha Williams are the winners of the 30th California International Marathon.Tapia, a member of the elite team of the Sacramento Running Association, which puts on the race, broke away from what was left of the lead pack in the last two miles to become the first American man to win the event since 1999.Williams was scheduled to run the New York City Marathon last month and joined the CIM field after New York was cancelled. A full-time financial analyst, she is the first American woman to win CIM since 2000.Both ran through consistent and at times driving rains that pelted the Folsom-to-Sacramento course.Official times were not immediately available.9:04 am: Sacramento elite runner Danny Tapia among leadersAnd then there were three. Danny Tapia, a member of the elite team of the SRA, which puts on the marathon, is in the lead with Ethiopia's Tesfaye Alemayehu and Kenya's Christopher Kipyego. Tapia, a former standout at UC Santa Cruz, appears to be pushing the pace and trying to grind out the final three miles of the race. The runners will finish at Ninth and Capitol. 8:43 am: American Sean Houseworth leads pack at mile 19The lead pack is dwindling approaching mile 19. American Sean Houseworth is at the head of the pack. Daniel Tapia, a member of the Sacramento Running Association's elite team, is also in the main pack of about seven runners. Others include Ethiopians Tesfaye Alemayehu and Teklu Deneke, Christopher Kipyego, Jeffrey Eggleston and Jason Ordway. The runners have had to navigate some large puddles but little serious street flooding along the course. 8:18 am: Runners pass the halfway mark as rain intensifiesJust past the halfway mark the men's lead pack is holding together. The lead runners appeared to pass the halfway point in about 1 hour, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.Mario Macias took a 15-to-20 meter lead in the first half but that gap has closed. American Daniel Tapia is also in the lead group. Rain is falling heavier than at the start.The lead pack still includes 11 runners. One ran the first half in a beanie hat and just tossed it aside on the street. Passing a series of storefronts along Fair Oaks Boulevard, there are very few specators along the route.7:48: Women's lead pack forms just behind men'sA women's lead pack has formed a few minutes behind the men's. It includes Americans Clara Peterson and Alisha Williams, Kristen Fryburg-Zaitz, Simegn Yeshanbel and Natasha LaBeaud.Nick Arciniaga continues to lead the men's lead pack, which still numbers nearly a dozen as it approaches the Fair Oaks Village.7:34 am: Leaders running at about 4:58 paceNear mile 6, a large pack of about a dozen runners is heading the California International Marathon. The lead pack just made the turn from Oak Avenue onto Fair Oaks Boulevard. Leaders were running at about a 4:58 pace over the last three miles. Nick Arciniaga of Flagstaff, Ariz., has hovered at the front of the pack. Mario Macias and Benson Osoro are also near the front. Heavy rain continues to fall on the runners. A few die-hard spectators are lining the course and volunteers staffing aid stations are wearing plastic sheets. 7:09 am: CIM off to a soggy startStrong winds and rain buffeted the start line of the Folsom-to-Sacramento race shortly before it began at 7 a.m. Gusts had knocked down some mile markers along the first half of the course. Many marathoners headed to the start draped in plastic sheets or garbage bags.Forecasts on the National Weather Service website called for winds of 20-23 mph with gusts of 25-28 mph, and nearly a half-inch of rain in Sacramento before noon. The race ends at Ninth Street and Capitol Mall.Both the men's and women's elite fields are strong, but the weather today will make it a challenge for anyone to challenge the course records.Follow race updates here."\u000a

And as if that weren't enough to add some spice to the 5-kilometer course, 100 zombies were unleashed on the trails, tasked with trying to rip flags from the runners in a series of symbolic body-snatchings. As a result, it was not unusual to see one runner using another as a body shield.""They yell like we're coming to eat them,"" said Maricela Cisneros, a volunteer zombie dressed in a mangled wedding gown. She and her boyfriend, Sam Lizarde, were stationed about 200 yards from the finish line and spent a good part of the morning picking off exhausted runners limping down the final stretch.The event combined two fads gaining in popularity: mud runs and zombies. Mud runs like the Tough Mudder series have attracted thousands of runners to the world of obstacle-course racing. Zombies have had a resurgence, led by the critically acclaimed AMC television series ""The Walking Dead.""The race scene had many elements of your typical Saturday fun run. Most of the runners seemed at least somewhat athletic, and there was a guy dressed like Elvis  just as there is at so many other races.Any doubt that this event was typical, however, evaporated quickly.At one point, an announcer urged runners to not ""harass the zombies"" (apparently one or two had been punched). There also seemed to be an exorbitant number of runners dressed in tutus.For avid runners like Brian Wedel, Chuck Rucker and Marc Krichman  none of whom was wearing a tutu, by the way  being chased around by a bunch of zombies presented a new challenge. All three got into the spirit by decorating their faces and necks with fake blood. Though they compete in several road races a year, each said the zombie mud run was an unexpectedly decent workout.""You get lulled into a sense of security and then all of a sudden you're surrounded,"" said Wedel.""They were athletic,"" Rucker said of the zombies.Well, not all of them.A few hours before they were scheduled to head out onto the course, A.J. Buckeye, Bre Corum and Pedro Martinez were going over the final touches on their zombie gear with one hand and sipping cans of beer with the other.""I've done a couple of 5Ks and to me, that may as well be a marathon,"" Corum said.""They want us to be sub-athletic,"" bragged Buckeye.The group  along with some other friends  was up all night getting ready. Their makeup was a mixture of gelatin, glue and toilet paper, along with a pretty healthy dose of fake blood.""We're zombies at heart,"" said Corum.The event was the brainchild of race organizer Dustin Ryen, whose background is in concert promotion. He said he liked the idea of a mud run because such a race is accessible ""to a wide variety of fitness levels."" As for the inclusion of zombies, Ryen said he and his wife are big fans of ""The Walking Dead.""His passions are apparently shared by others. There's actually another zombie run next weekend in Sacramento's Miller Park and a similar race was held Saturday in Temecula.""People feed into it like it could actually happen,"" Cisneros said of a post-apocalyptic world ruled by zombies. ""Getting eaten alive is what freaks people out."""\u000a

V"Rocklin coach Greg Benzel can commiserate with Sierra Foothill League coaching rivals Ernie Cooper of Granite Bay and Casey Taylor of Del Oro.Cooper and Taylor have received criticism for scheduling so many formidable nonleague opponents. The two defending Sac-Joaquin Section champions are a combined 1-7.But Benzel said a challenging nonleague season is a must for those who hope to win what has consistently been one of the section's premier leagues.""If you don't schedule tough, you won't be ready to play in our league,"" said Benzel, whose No. 13 Thunder finished its nonleague schedule 2-3 but on a high note Friday with a 31-22 homecoming win over previously unbeaten Inderkum. ""Granite Bay and Del Oro may be 1-3 and 0-4, but you can bet they'll be ready to rock and roll when they play us.""While it didn't have Southern California powers on its schedule, as did Granite Bay and Del Oro, Rocklin played four teams currently in The Bee's Top 20.The Thunder lost to No. 10 Pleasant Grove 35-21, No. 4 Oak Ridge 16-7 and No. 11 Del Campo 21-20. In addition to beating No. 9 Inderkum, the Thunder topped crosstown rival Whitney 6-0 in the annual Quarry Bowl. Whitney was ranked 18th by The Bee at the time.""We have found ways to give games away and to let teams back into the games,"" Benzel said of the three setbacks. ""But what's impressed me about our guys is that even without the (victory) payoff at the end, I don't have to worry about character. These guys get after it.""The Thunder kept speedy Inderkum contained and on its heels for much of Friday's game. The Thunder sacked quarterback C.J. Spencer four times, and Ryan Durgarian also intercepted a pass. Most of all, Rocklin minimized the speedy Tigers' momentum-changing explosive plays.The performance reminded Rocklin fans of the 2009 season, when the Thunder beat Grant for the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II championship, and then played Servite of Anaheim tough in the CIF State Bowl game in finishing 14-1.Benzel, who is playing many juniors, has been pleased with how his players have responded. Several have stepped up to plug injury-related holes.The biggest gap filler has been junior quarterback Logan Webb. He replaced Daniel Kniffin, arguably the team's best athlete and fastest player, after the senior suffered a separated shoulder late in the game against Oak Ridge.In three games running Rocklin's pistol attack, Webb has thrown eight touchdowns, including four against Inderkum, with no interceptions.""Logan's got a touch on the ball,"" Benzel said. ""He's making great decisions and has established his confidence with the guys. That's not always easy for a junior to do.""Kniffin could be healthy by the league opener Oct. 5 at No. 7 Nevada Union. But as far as who might start should Kniffin be good to go, Benzel would only say that ""it's a delicate issue and a good problem to have.""Metro test  One drawback for Sac High being a charter school is it operates on a different schedule than its Metro Conference opponents.So just as the Dragons (3-1) are getting ready to play No. 3 Burbank (4-0) on Friday, the school started its three-week fall break.""When there's no school, the kids don't eat as well, they stay out late, there's less structure, so that doesn't always bode well for us,"" said Sac High coach Paul Doherty, in his third season as head coach, seventh overall. ""Our players are looking forward to Burbank. They're very good. But we're better than we've been, now that we've had our coaching staff in place for a while. Our kids are familiar with our (spread) scheme."""\u000a

V"Sacramento High's Ayanna Edwards didn't score her first points in Saturday's Sac-Joaquin Section Division II girls basketball championship game against rival Florin until 47 seconds remained.But the 6-foot-4 junior, nicknamed ""Shaq"" for her imposing size and athleticism, was a huge factor in the top-seeded Dragons' 48-37 win over No. 6 Florin at Sleep Train Arena.Edwards had 11 rebounds and seven blocks and altered enough Panthers shots to keep the Dragons comfortably ahead from the start.Junior Chaya Durr had a career-high 27 points, and junior point guard Zonyia Cormier added nine points and two steals for Sacramento (27-4).The Dragons won their third consecutive section title (the previous two at D-III) and are likely headed for the new CIF Northern California Open Division playoffs this week.Daijah Joe-Smith had 17 points and nine rebounds, and Dalayna Sampton had seven points and 10 rebounds for Florin (22-9). The Dragons' Metro Conference rival was a surprise finalist after upsetting No. 2 McNair of Stockton 44-41 in Thursday's semifinals. Florin also advances to the NorCals.Edwards, a three-year varsity player, finished with two points and took only four shots. She also stopped a 10-0 Florin run early in the fourth quarter by blocking a shot, leading to a Durr breakaway layup and a 39-24 lead.""She truly dominated,"" Sacramento coach Michele Massari said. ""She's listed with seven blocks (by the official scorekeeper), but I think she had more than that. They were afraid to really go at her until the end.""Even though she had a marvelous game, Edwards didn't escape the demanding Massari's wrath midway through the fourth quarter, when she started limping after bumping knees with a Florin player.""Stop limping or you're coming out,"" Massari yelled across the court.The highly recruited Edwards wasn't chagrined. She knows Massari wants only her best effort.""I tore my patella tendon in my left knee during the summer,"" she said. ""I've rehabbed it, but sometimes, if you hit it right, it cramps up and is painful. I just have to shake it off. I'll get some Icy Hot, and I'll be fine. I'm not done anytime soon.""Edwards, who Massari calls ""a big, soft teddy bear,"" was going to be the Dragons' section sportsmanship recipient, an award given to a player from each team after the championship game.But her competitiveness got her into trouble.She was disqualified from consideration, per section rules, when she knocked down Joe-Smith trying to go for a block late. The referee's flagrant-foul decision came after Joe-Smith, who took several seconds to climb back to her feet, exchanged friendly hand slaps with Edwards.""I truly didn't mean to knock her down,"" Edwards said. ""I respect Daijah a lot, but we're both competitive players on the court. I'd never purposely try to hurt someone because I love basketball too much, and that's disrespecting the game."""\u000a

V"He's seen this sort of late-game dramatics unfold for four seasons now, and the view and results never get old.Joey Rollings is the coach of the first four-time successive Sac-Joaquin Section Division I champion, and two players who have had a hand in every one of those victories are Dakarai Allen and D'Erryl Williams.The best of friends headed to San Diego State on scholarship didn't score in bunches Saturday night against a familiar foe as they have so many times before, but they contributed plenty otherwise.Allen and Williams keyed a 60-57 win over rival Pleasant Grove in the Division I final at Sleep Train Arena.Williams, a 6-foot-4 guard, scored on a putback off a Ryan Manning three-point miss for a 60-57 lead with 14.9 seconds left, and he wound up with the ball after Cole Nordquist was just short on a three at the buzzer.Williams had just six points, but he grabbed seven of his game-high 10 rebounds in the fourth quarter and expertly ran his team from the point.The Huskies (25-5) are 3-0 against the Eagles (24-6) this season, each game increasingly more intense and meaningful. The first two decided the Delta River League and this one was for bigger bragging rights. Both teams advance to the Northern California Regional playoffs.Allen, Sheldon's 6-6 wing with an inside-outside game, had eight points, nearly 10 below his average, but he's hardly just a scorer. He had an emphatic block that triggered a fast break with Darin Johnson (21 points) finishing with a dunk for a 56-50 lead with 2:24 to play.Moments earlier, Allen ended the third quarter at the buzzer with a baseline alley oop lob and dunk by Johnson for a 43-42 lead.Antonio Lewis had 14 points and nine rebounds and earned game Sportsmanship Honors with Pleasant Grove's Matt Smrekar.""D'Erryl and Dakarai are amazing,"" Rollings said. ""We've been here so many times. I normally don't call time out, but I did here and just told them, 'take care of business.' They did.""Pleasant Grove's Big 3 of Nordquist, a forward, and guards Malik Thames and Matt Hayes played well enough to win. Thames had 18 points, Hayes 13 and Nordquist 19 with nine rebounds. His soaring dunk with 54 seconds left cut it to 58-57.Allen wore the championship banner as a makeshift cape after the game with a look of pride and exhaustion.Allen said this is exactly where the Huskies expected to be, at Sleep Train Arena, four-peating with more goals to accomplish in the form of a repeat Northern California Regional title.""We were supposed to do this,"" Allen said. ""We wanted to play Pleasant Grove. That's a good team.""Said Williams, ""Ever since (Allen and me) have been kids, we played unselfish and hard. We've been here. We're used to it.""Next for Sheldon is the first Open Division NorCal field, which puts the heavyweight programs in one bracket, regardless of division.""We want to play the best,"" Allen said. ""We can't wait.""  Division IVSummerville 63, Liberty Ranch 52  Connor Morningstar scored 12 points and fellow 6-7 senior forward Rosendo Amaya-Wood had nine points and 14 rebounds to give the Bears (25-3) of Tuolomne their first championship in any division.Michael Meserole had 24 points and nine rebounds for the Hawks (22-9).

V"Seniors Ahmad Smith, Tyler Berkness and Adam Ciszewski have a chance to do what no other Bella Vista boys basketball players have done in school history.Key contributors as sophomores, the trio can become the first Broncos players to win three consecutive league championships.The No. 6 Broncos got a big start toward that goal Thursday by beating Fair Oaks rival No. 10 Del Campo 63-58 in a Capital Valley Conference opener at Bella Vista.Smith had 20 points and Berkness 12, while the 6-foot-3 Ciszewski played outstanding defense against Del Campo's 6-7 senior star Semir Cahtarevic.With Ciszewski in his face, Cahtarevic missed two potential score-tying three-point attempts from above the key in the final minute. Cahtarevic helped Del Campo rally from 10 points down late in the third quarter to close within 55-54 with a three-pointer with 4:09 to play.Bella Vista (13-4) stayed one to three points ahead the rest of the way until Dominic Driggs, who finished with 17 points, made two free throws with one second to play.""They call it the Battle of the Oaks in football, and it carries over to us, too,"" Bella Vista coach Dave Gonzalez said. ""It's a special rivalry.""We knew when we got up 10 that they were going to make a run because they have such a good offense. We made some plays at the end to pull it out.""Although Ciszewski and senior Austin Hennen combined for only six points, Gonzalez said their defense on Cahtarevic and 6-4 junior Vasilije Saraba were keys to the victory.The Del Campo duo went into the game averaging a combined 34 points. Cahtarevic finished with 14 and Saraba 10, and they were a combined 9 for 33 from the field. Joe Ramirez scored 11 points for Del Campo (13-5).""We knew they were good shooters, so we just tried to stay in front of them, keep our feet moving,"" Ciszewski said. ""We tried to be physical with them the whole game, not let them get anything easy.""Ciszewski played in 22 varsity games as a freshman for a Bella Vista team that went 12-14 overall and 5-5 in the Capital Athletic League.Since then, Bella Vista has been on the rise.Two years ago, the Broncos went 16-13 and won the title in their first year in the CVC with a 9-1 record. They lost to Antelope in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II quarterfinals.Last season, Bella Vista improved to 26-6, won the CVC again (9-1) and fell again to Antelope, this time in the semifinals at Sleep Train Arena.""We've really developed good chemistry over the last three years and Tyler, Ahmad and me are just trying to set a good example, especially for the younger players,"" Ciszewski said. ""Winning league is a big goal, but we'd like to go even farther in the playoffs. It will be a challenge because we're now in D-I."""\u000a

V"Considering the fact that most people think playwright Jane Martin is actually former Actors Theatre of Louisville artistic director Jon Jory, it's fascinating that Martin's expertise lies in creating smartly developed women characters.Jory has always been Martin's spokesman and though he continually denies beingJane Martin, he has directed all the premieres of ""her"" plays. ""Talking With ,"" a play of 11 10-minute monologues, gained Martin national recognition and won the American Theatre Critics Association Award for best regional play in 1982. It's been a popular regional staple ever since. Resurrection Theater presents the play with 11 actresses taking on the wide range of characters, with the cast including Margaret Morneau, Susan Madden, Gay Cooper, Shaleen Schmutzer-Smith, Ruby Sketchley and Tara Henry.

From early attention grabbers like covers of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Knowing Me Knowing You"" by Abba, live explorations of ""Heart of Glass"" (Blondie) and ""We Are the Champions"" (Queen) to a recent album that added a vocalist and tunes like ""How Deep Is Your Love"" (Bee Gees) and ""Barracuda"" (Heart), the band broadly wandered the pop landscape with a cheeky, open-minded sensibility and solid jazz chops. Now the band, consisting of pianist Ethan Iverson, bassist Reid Anderson and drummer David King, has smartly hopped out of the corner they had backed into and has just released its first album of all-original material, ""Never Stop.""

V"A stretch of landscaped levee where the city of Elk Grove plans to remove 140 trees and plants at a cost of about $20,000 is barely a quarter of a mile long.To some, the work to be conducted next month near the Stone Lakes National Wildlife Refuge is but a tiny blip on the environmental radar.But to others, it's a classic representation of the tug of war over a hugely controversial U.S. Army Corps of Engineers policy  reiterated in 2007 after Hurricane Katrina  that allows only grass on levees nationally.The state of California officially opposes the policy, arguing there is little evidence that trees threaten levees and that there are better ways to spend limited flood protection dollars. In addition, Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Sacramento, introduced a bill in Congress that would order the Army Corps to create regional exceptions for the management of trees on levees.In Elk Grove, officials have decided to remove vegetation from several sections of its 4-mile levee, in keeping with the Corps' standard, so it won't lose eligibility for federal assistance to rebuild the levee if it fails in a flood or storm.""The bottom line is there's a lot at stake if we are not in compliance,"" Elk Grove Mayor Gary Davis said in an interview. ""So we are moving quickly to ensure our residents are not harmed.""Chris Gray, a spokesman for the Sacramento district of the Corps of Engineers, said the grass-only policy in this case was part of a 1997 agreement between the Corps and Sacramento County. The agreement was inherited by the city of Elk Grove, which incorporated in 2000.An irrigation system lies under some areas of the levee, and trees have toppled, uplifting root balls and creating holes where failures can occur. Among the trees to be removed are redwoods, oaks, pines and fruit trees.The existing landscaping is ""very clearly inhibiting inspection"" of the site, Gray said.The state had negotiated with the Corps to modify the grass-only policy for years. After those talks fell short, the state Department of Fish and Wildlife last year filed a federal lawsuit, alleging the levee policy violates the Endangered Species Act and other laws.Bob Wright, senior counsel for Friends of the River, said he believes the policy puts ""cities like Elk Grove in a tough spot,"" because it forces them to choose between trees and federal aid for prospective levee repairs.Friends of the River and other environmental groups have filed a suit of their own against the Corps.On Wednesday night, at a community meeting held by Elk Grove and the Corps near the levee, Wright peppered city and Corps officials with questions.After one question, Darren Wilson, Elk Grove's engineering services manager, told Wright that the city Planning Department had determined that the California Environmental Quality Act was not an issue at the site.Wilson also said there are no endangered species at the site.Wright asked how to get copies of emails between the city and the Corps. Wilson replied that Wright could ask for ""all email correspondence"" regarding the levee.Wright later told The Bee he views the Corps policy as a ""national anti-tree policy"" and a ""one-size-fits-all prohibition.""A day after the meeting, however, the Corps' Gray countered that there's ""quite a bit of difference between the Elk Grove levee and work being done elsewhere.""""Normally, you're looking at riparian habitat or species that are in the Endangered Species Act,"" Gray said. ""You have those in the main stem of the river.""In this case, it's a dry levee. It's not on the main river stem. These are trees that were planted intentionally. They're not naturally occurring.""So it's quite different."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/28/4943736/jesuit-rebounds-to-beat-sheldon.html,"Jesuit's Devin Kelly usually lets his actions on the football field do his talking.But the senior all-purpose player felt he needed to step out of character at Friday night's team dinner and again at halftime Saturday of the Marauders' Senior Day Delta River League game against visiting Sheldon.After a penalty-filled first half, Jesuit trailed 13-10 in a must-win game to keep alive its playoff hopes.""I challenged the guys,"" Kelly said. ""I said we may have only two games left and for the seniors this may be the last game we play on our home field. So how do we want to be remembered? I was pretty fired up.""The 5-foot-9, 160-pound Kelly was pretty fired up on the field, too.To start the second half, he took the kickoff at his own 15-yard line and dashed through several would-be Sheldon tacklers for a 50-yard gain  only to see his dazzling effort nullified by a penalty.But he wasn't done, despite being so exhausted he had to lean on offensive lineman Rafael Aguilar to keep from keeling over.On the next play, Kelly took a handoff from quarterback Thomas Sperbeck and weaved his way for a 51-yard gain to Sheldon's 15-yard line.Three plays later, James Avila-Ellington scored his second touchdown on a four-yard run, and Jesuit never looked back in posting a 38-13 win.The Marauders (5-4, 1-3) can earn a playoff berth Friday with an upset at No. 7 Oak Ridge (8-1, 3-1) in the regular-season finale.Kelly plays wide receiver or running back on offense. He's an every-play defensive back and special-teams leader.In addition to his 51-yard run, Kelly returned two kickoffs 35 and 55 yards, rushed two other times for 31 yards, caught a 14-yard pass and played ably on defense against quick, athletic Sheldon (3-6, 0-4). The Huskies compiled 331 total yards, including Curtis Joniel's 118 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 28 carries.""Devin carries a big load for us,"" said Jesuit coach Marlon Blanton. ""He's versatile and he's got some speed, so we're always trying to find ways to get him the ball.""Kelly, who played only defense last season, played so hard he had to leave the game for a stretch in the second half with a leg cramp.But Sperbeck, Jesuit's remarkable quarterback-free safety, pinch hit nicely for him, returning a punt 81 yards for a touchdown to open the fourth quarter. It came shortly after he had scored on a 34-yard run.""That's Thomas,"" Kelly said. ""He's such a great player and a lot of fun to watch. He always puts the team on his back.""Friday's game against Oak Ridge will have a little extra meaning for Kelly. He lives in El Dorado Hills and grew up playing youth football with members of the Oak Ridge team that expects to challenge for a Sac-Joaquin Section title.""I respect those guys. They have a great program up there,"" Kelly said.First-year coach Blanton is pleased that his players still have a shot at the postseason entering Week 10 after a roller-coaster season.Jesuit won four of its first five games before dropping consecutive league games to Ponderosa, No. 2 Folsom and No. 8 Pleasant Grove.""It's been tough for these guys,"" said Blanton, who was hired late in the spring after longtime coach Dan Carmazzi stepped down to return to Christian Brothers, his alma mater. ""They've had to deal with new coaches, a new system and a new way of doing things. I'm proud of these guys."""\u000a

V"Robert Earl Keen describes ""I Gotta Go"" as his favorite song from his newest album, ""Ready for Confetti.""""It's what I call a sky song,"" Keen said. ""Sky songs just fall down on you. They're a gift. They're always easy to play. You record them and then you can sing them over and over. In the past, I've made some mistakes in lyrics, like for instance a grammatical error. There is none of that here.""""Ready for Confetti"" is different from Keen's other 15 albums in several ways. Some songs have shorter lengths, unusual for Keen. And the album was written on the road, a process Keen once said he would never undergo. He usually writes in what he calls his ""Scriptorium,"" a cabin on a hill.In fact, he's writing on the road again.""I'm going to sit down and do it,"" he promised in a call from Columbia, Mo., one of his tour stops. ""We have traveled more miles than we have ever covered, this year. One of my players (guitarist Rich Brotherton) was in a terrible automobile accident, but is back now. We've had multiple illnesses in our office. But I am as well as I have ever been. I'm 56 and still acting like a teenager.""Keen's live performances, like one tonight at John Ascuaga's Nugget, are usually a lively mix of music and storytelling. Keen loves to tell stories because ""it makes me feel like I'm a part of the audience  that we have become one collective person,"" he said.His stories, as his songs, usually come from personal experiences, like when he describes a recent hunting trip with a friend in Texas.""We go hunting every fall, and he always seems to find a strange place,"" Keen said. ""This year, it was in a landfill. Here we are in the middle of burning trash, hunting doves  they shoot everything in Texas. It turns out the doves are smarter than people are and they would not land. Another hunter who is with us asks, well into the hunt, 'Where does he find these places?' It was not a successful hunt.""Keen, of late, seems to have become more comfortable in himself. He says he no longer feels the need to prove himself, nor does he feel like every song has to be thought-provoking. Not that the new album is without some sarcasm (check out ""The Road Goes On and On"") or is in any way mindless, but the tone of ""I Gotta Go,"" which Keen said is ""rhythmic, fun and upbeat,"" is far more prevalent.There is also a cover of Todd Snider's ""Play a Train Song"" because Snider is one of Keen's favorite entertainers and also a storyteller.""Todd is really narrative-oriented,"" Keen said. ""He attracted me to that sort of writing. I hear stuff he does and I feel like I should have written it, could have written it, if I woke up and did it.""Keen's show tonight will showcase songs, and the band, from the album. ""They have been with me since 1987,"" Keen said of the band. ""Too often, the musicians on a stage are not the ones who are on the records. And that's what sets us apart. They are the same musicians.""Doing our shows is always a kick. The most common comment I hear after a show is 'I've been listening to you for 10 years and I should definitely have come to see you sooner. I had no idea.'

V"In years such as this, race director John Mansoor expects a smaller field of elite runners for the California International Marathon.Turnout often ebbs right after the Olympics, he said, because American runners aren't flocking to the fast course in hopes of qualifying for the Olympic Trials.The top of Sunday's field appeared similarly tight  until last month, when organizers canceled the New York City Marathon in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Some elite runners began looking for other places to race, and some  Mansoor estimates about 10  settled on Northern California.""If we were going to have five runners in contention (to win) prior to New York, we now maybe have 10,"" Mansoor said.It hasn't created a scenario, he said, in which ""a person was favored to win (the CIM) prior to New York, and now New York has sent somebody who is heads above the field. But it certainly added some depth and strength.""That adds intrigue to Sunday's Folsom-to-Sacramento race. If conditions are wet and windy, as expected, it's unlikely anyone will run the race like 2010 winner Dylan Wykes, who broke away from the leaders early and tackled the rest of the course alone.Should the leaders stick together into the later miles, more depth means more potential answers to the question of who will try to ""kick"" first toward the finish line  and more competition for each individual to consider.""The real question with those New York runners is they're a month past their peak right now,"" Mansoor said. ""And if they were totally focused on New York, that's a long time to try to maintain your peak. That's going to be difficult for them.""The timing, said Flagstaff, Ariz.-based runner Nick Arciniaga, was part of the reason he settled on the CIM. The 29-year-old, who finished eighth at the Olympic Trials in January, had tapered his training ahead of the New York event and needed to build up and re-taper before racing.Arciniaga said it's ""difficult to get my mind wrapped around being able to be physically ready for this race.""The breakthrough, he said, came at the 10K Dana Point Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving.""It went 10 times better than I expected,"" said Arciniaga, who finished third in 29 minutes, 29 seconds. ""It let me know what my fitness actually was, rather than just what I was hoping it would be.""Arciniaga immediately appears among the favorites in the CIM men's field. His personal best of 2 hours, 11 minutes, 30 seconds is the second-fastest in the field behind Tesfaye Alemayehu (2:11:18).As with the New York race, Arciniaga said he doesn't plan to run for time as much as position, especially if the weather is bad. Having entered late, he said he did glance at the other favorites to get a sense of their past finishes.""I took a look at all their times, 2:11 to 2:15, and I'm like, OK, this is the same ballpark as what I consistently run,"" Arciniaga said. ""I just need to go out there and compete.""Alemayehu, an Ethiopian who lives in Antioch, anticipates good times despite the weather forecast.""I think it will be a good race this year, a fast race,"" he said. ""They are good athletes.""Alisha Williams, 30, a financial analyst from Colorado Springs, planned to run just her second marathon in New York. Her first came at the Olympic Trials. She finished 14th in 2:35:09. Williams, fifth in the 10,000 meters at the Trials, opted for the CIM over a long break partly to run against a strong field in hopes of setting a personal record.""I don't think I adjusted the time goal at all,"" Williams said. ""The workouts have been going pretty well. I don't know what to expect with the weather and the tapering, building up again and tapering. But when you go into a race, you want to put it all out there.""Williams' best time is the fifth-fastest in the CIM women's field, and she could challenge Ethiopia's Yihunilish Delelecha (2:30:38), Russia's Natalia Sergeeva (2:33:01) and Atalelech Asfaw (2:33:56), an American originally from Ethiopia.""It is nice to try to run for the win as opposed to New York, where that was not ever going to be an option when you're going up against Olympic champions,"" Williams said. ""That part is really exciting, and I think that'll be fun."""\u000a

V"Eric Cavaliere has a simple question and concern as he pores over film of the Folsom football team.The Oak Ridge coach wonders if the Bulldogs' quarterback express will ever stall down the road on Highway 50.""When are they not going to have a 4,000-yard passer? Geez!"" Cavaliere said about his team's opponent tonight in a Delta River League opener in El Dorado Hills.Fourth-ranked Oak Ridge and No. 5 Folsom are both 5-0 and coming off bye weeks, rested and ready to test the scoreboard lights. It all starts with the quarterbacks.Folsom sophomore Jake Browning ranks second nationally and first in the state in passing yards (2,010) by quarterbacks who have played five games. Browning has 19 touchdown passes, eight to senior standout Phillip Carter, and is on target to reach 4,000 yards. In 2010, Folsom featured the MaxPreps National Player of the Year, Dano Graves. Last season, Tanner Trosin became the first quarterback in the state to eclipse 5,000 passing yards in a season, according to Cal-Hi Sports.The Trojans feature senior Jason Samuels, who has passed for 963 yards and 12 touchdowns, six to Byron Spain.Both teams have superb offensive lines. Folsom excels in the spread offense, pushing the tempo and rarely punting. Oak Ridge has been a pocket-passing team since the school started playing varsity football 30 years ago.But can anyone disrupt the passing flow tonight? Oak Ridge has 18 sacks, 10 1/2 by senior defensive end Zack Claiborne. Folsom has 20 sacks, mostly by committee. ""The key for us will be the same as always  get to their QB,"" Cavaliere said. ""(Folsom coach Kris) Richardson does such a great job with their O-line. We need to control the tempo with our offense.""Technique in trenches  Inderkum's speed and fine offensive-line play have helped the Tigers win the past five Tri-County League championships.

V"Key West boat captain Chris Lembo recently sold his rods, reels and 30-foot boat. It marked the end of Incognito Charters, his once-lucrative business of taking tourists to the reef and shipwrecks to fish.High fuel prices, new fishing regulations and the national recession all struck the business hard.``Then the BP oil spill hit,'' he said. ``That was the final straw.''Lembo is among the more than 10,000 businesses and individuals in South Florida that have filed claims or federal lawsuits against the oil giant and its contractors. They are seeking compensation for damage and future damage caused by the blowout of the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20.Many already have received emergency interim payments.As of Dec. 2, the Gulf Coast Claims Facility -- which is processing claims to BP's $20 billion compensation fund -- has paid out $44.1 million for 2,776 approved claims out of 6,455 filed by individuals and businesses in the Keys.Of the claims not paid, some are still being processed, others need more documentation and some have been denied.``I think we'll get well over $100 million in the Keys by the time it's done,'' said former Monroe County Mayor Mario De Gennaro, a member of the Florida Oil Spill Recovery Task Force.The BP fund also has paid out $4.1 million for 462 approved claims in Miami-Dade County and another $2.9 million for 58 approved claims from Broward County.So far, 26 lawsuits filed in the Southern District of Florida have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation, where common pretrial work is handled before a single judge, in this case U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier based in Louisiana.Compensation for those cases likely will take at least two years, and probably many more.Claims have come from all types of South Florida businesses and residents.

V"WASHINGTON  Houston-based Halliburton knew that the cement it was using to seal BP's Deepwater Horizon oil well was likely to be unstable, but it didn't tell BP or act on the information internally before the well blew up April 20, the staff of the presidential commission that's investigating the disaster reported Thursday.  In a letter to the commission's seven members, the staff says the failure of the cement was a key factor in the blowout, which resulted in millions of barrels of crude oil escaping into the Gulf of Mexico in a torrent that went largely unchecked for three months. But the staff also took pains to point out that unstable cement wasn't the sole factor _ or even the most crucial one _ in the well's failure. That blame, the letter says, belongs to BP and Transocean, the company that BP had hired to drill the well.  ""Industry experts inform us that cementing failures are not uncommon even in the best of circumstances,"" the letter says. ""Because it may be anticipated that a particular cement job may be faulty, the oil industry has developed tests . . . to identify cementing failures."" ""BP and/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well,"" the letter concludes. The letter adds to the growing body of evidence that at least at the Deepwater Horizon drilling site, the safety procedures that are intended to head off such accidents were ignored or overlooked. BP acknowledged in a September report that its internal investigation had found that cementing tests were misinterpreted or weren't run. In its letter Thursday, the commission staff expressed concern that similar oversights were widespread in the offshore drilling industry. ""We want to report these results immediately to facilitate your consideration of their implications for offshore drilling safety,"" the letter says. Oil drilling companies use cement to seal an exploratory well such as the Deepwater Horizon one as the last step before assigning a drilling rig to another location. Once the seal is in place, technicians remove heavy drilling mud from the well and replace it with lighter seawater. It was during this step that hydrocarbons surged up the Deepwater Horizon drill pipe, enveloped the rig in a cloud of methane and exploded, killing 11 rig workers and setting off the largest accidental spill in history. Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of oil well cementing services and its reach extends not only to the Gulf of Mexico but also to deepwater drilling sites throughout the world. A bad Halliburton cement job is suspected in the explosion last year of a well in the Timor Sea near Australia.The letter, signed by commission counsel Fred H. Bartlit Jr. and two other staff members, came just two days after Chevron reported the results of efforts it made, using materials provided by Halliburton, to duplicate Halliburton's cementing mixture. In every instance, Chevron reported, the procedures it followed failed to produce stable cement. ""We were unable to generate stable foam from any of the tests,"" Chevron's cementing team leader, Craig Gardner, told the commission in a letter. Chevron conducted the tests ""as a public service"" at the request of the commission, Bartlit says in his letter. ""Halliburton agreed that the Chevron lab was highly qualified for the work,"" the letter says. The Chevron results should have come as no surprise to Halliburton or BP, Bartlit's letter suggests. He says that when the Chevron results came in, the commission asked Halliburton for its own internal test results, which Halliburton provided. Those documents showed that at least three of four tests Halliburton conducted had found that the cement would fail, the commission staff letter says. ""The first two tests were conducted in February 2010,"" the letter says. ""Both tests indicated the foam slurry design was unstable."" Halliburton did pass the data from one of the February tests to BP on March 8 in a technical report. But Halliburton didn't highlight the significance of the test and there was no indication that ""BP personnel raised any questions about it,"" the letter says.  Another test conducted in April had similar results, but ""it appears that Halliburton never provided the data to BP,"" the letter says.  A fourth test, conducted after Halliburton changed its testing procedures just days before the explosion, showed that the cement mixture would be stable, but it was unclear whether the testing had been completed before the cement was poured. The results of that test weren't provided to BP until after the well exploded, the letter says. President Barack Obama appointed the commission earlier this year to investigate the causes of the disaster and recommend new regulations to prevent a similar crisis. The commission is co-chaired by former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and William K. Reilly, who was the head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush.

V"This is how members of the Christian Brothers High School student body greeted Dan Carmazzi on Tuesday night for a home volleyball match.They chanted his name. Welcome home, coach.Tonight's Holy Bowl XLII pitting No. 16 CBS and No. 15 Jesuit will have its own fresh coat of paint in this rivalry game at refurbished Hughes Stadium. For starters, Carmazzi is back on the CBS sideline as an assistant coach, the first time he has worn the Falcons' blue and red since his assistant coaching days at his alma mater in the mid-1970s. Carmazzi was a quarterback in the first two Holy Bowls in 1969 and 1970, a decade before his tenure as Jesuit head coach from 1980 through last season.""We know it's going to be extra-emotional for coach Carmazzi because of his ties to Jesuit,"" CBS wide receiver Jalen Walker said. ""This game is always fun, and knowing coach Carmazzi will be there will make this even more fun.""Jesuit leads the all-time series 25-14-2, losing the first meeting at American River College 20-13 behind touchdowns by Dennis Bertacchi and Danny Galvez, and winning the second showdown 8-7 when sophomore quarterback Dano McGinn scrambled in for the winning two-point conversion on the final play  his only snap of the game.There have been close contests in the mud, wild finishes in the fog, shootouts in the rain and varying results on warm fall evenings. Tonight, Jesuit introduces new coach Marlon Blanton to its top non-league rival in which a crowd of 16,000 is expected.Jesuit quarterback Thomas Sperbeck had just one carry in last year's Holy Bowl, slowed by mononucleosis. He enters tonight's game healthy and eager  and to embrace Carmazzi regardless of the outcome.""Coach Carmazzi was a great coach here,"" Sperbeck said. ""We're all excited about this game. We think Jesuit made a great choice in getting coach Blanton.""Carmazzi coached three of his sons in the Holy Bowl  Gio, Matt and Dominic in the 1990s. The Sperbeck name also has ties to the Holy Bowl. Dick Sperbeck  Thomas' grandfather  coached CBS in the 1960s and '70s.Carmazzi has been involved in more Holy Bowls than anyone, as a player, assistant coach and head coach with 39 total games. As a head coach, he lost his first six Holy Bowls, then beat CBS 13-10 in 1986 when quarterback Mike McIntee hit Dan Cahill for a touchdown pass. Carmazzi joked years later that the breakthrough victory ""saved my soul.""All told, Carmazzi went 22-10 against CBS in the Holy Bowl, winning nine in a row at one point.None of that matters tonight, a new era with the same old desire for bragging rights.

VSports>Run,http://www.sacbee.com/2012/05/24/4511933/for-these-races-it-isnt-the-field.html,"Experiencing a historic run  from the Big Sur International Marathon to the Boston Marathon to the Peachtree road race in Atlanta  is rewarding. But it can also prove onerous.The country's most well-known events fill quickly, sometimes via lotteries or convoluted qualifying standards.Runners with hopes of making it to the starting line often have to rent cars and make airline and hotel reservations months in advance.Crowded expos, restrictive starting-line grids, long bus trips to drop-off areas  the hectic nature of massive running events can prompt more of the stress that runners are trying to reduce.But there's another approach to destination running  going smaller.Northern California has some of the country's biggest running events. But it also has many un- heralded, small-field events with vast appeal and interesting names  the Quad Dipsea to the Last Chance 50, for example.""For the newer runners, it is a glimpse into the way things used to be,"" said John Medinger, race director of the Quad Dipsea, the low-key ultramarathon in Mill Valley that debuted in 1983 with eight runners. ""It's the way it used to be when all races were small and nearly everyone knew everyone else.""Now a must-run event among runners who prefer distances longer than the marathon, the Quad Dipsea is 28.4 miles, a double-out-and-back traverse of the famed Dipsea Trail. It's set for Nov. 24 this year.""We intentionally keep Quad Dipsea low-key and 'old school,' "" said Medinger, a veteran endurance athlete and publisher of UltraRunning Magazine. ""A lot of folks run it to cap off their years before lying fallow over the winter.""One of the beauties of the event is that it is out-and-back twice, so you get to see everyone else in the race three times. There's a lot of high-fiving and camaraderie generated out on the trail. Most runners hang around for a long time after they finish, and the party goes on all afternoon.""Since its inaugural running, the Quad Dipsea has grown exponentially. The event is about 30 times as large as it once was, with last year's starting field of 265 runners and finishing field of 233 record highs.""The Dipsea Trail has a bit of everything,"" said Medinger. ""It's infamous for its stairs. But there are dense redwood forests, open grasslands with vast vistas over the Pacific to the west and San Francisco to the south, and a bit of urbanity at either end, Mill Valley and Stinson Beach.""The Forest of Nisene Marks Marathon doesn't have the same legend as the Quad Dipsea or its more well-known shorter distance sibling, the 103-year-old Dipsea Race. But its course is equally stunning.""I'm a big fan of the smaller races, especially trail-type races,"" said Russ Coillot, owner of the Fleet Feet store in Aptos that sponsors the 12-year-old marathon. ""They are a little less glitzy. They are a lot more grass-roots. The atmosphere is usually a lot more relaxed.""Despite its name, the marathon is actually three races, including a 5-kilometer run and a half-marathon, all held in Nisene Marks State Park and with a field never exceeding 500.""People absolutely come here to run the event as a vacation spot,"" said Coillot, who moved to the area recently from Sacramento. ""I've been coming here since I was a kid. I cannot tell you how peaceful and serene it is in the park. It's amazing, just amazing.""Several years ago, runners finishing the Gold Country Half-Marathon and Marathon in Nevada City were ideally welcomed entering Pioneer Park: A folk guitarist serenaded the field. Local volunteers provided homemade picnic fare and area businesses offered raffle prizes.The event took runners on up-and-down terrain that added at least an hour to most runners' average road marathon finishing times.But the route featured flume trails, the traversing of wooden bridges and running through tunnels. The marathon no longer exists, but its organizers, Christian Youth Ministries, still direct other niche events, including the 49er Canyon 10-Miler in Auburn.Individuals and two-runner teams can enter, with the course among the most strenuous, yet beloved, sections of the 100-mile Western States Endurance Run.Like the former marathon, the Auburn 10-miler is on a rugged trail. Runners experience nature with few restraints and finish in a community-oriented setting.Several years ago, a runner finishing the Gold Country event said the finish reminded him of attending a Southampton (N.Y.) lawn party. It's a description that works well for small field running events everywhere."\u000a

V"Overhauling the tax system is the subject of endless talk and little action in Washington. But as Republican governors in a range of states start to act aggressively on the issue, they are setting up limited but politically ambitious and potentially telling experiments in what might be possible nationwide. It is not just that they are cutting taxes. It is how they are taking tentative steps toward rebalancing what kinds of taxes their states rely on. In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal is pushing to repeal the state's personal and corporate income taxes and make up the lost revenue through higher sales taxes. Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska is calling for much the same thing in his state. Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas wants to keep in place what was supposed to be a temporary increase in the state sales tax to help pay for his plan to lower and eventually end his state's income tax. Those governors and others going down the same general path are justifying their proposals on many grounds. These include making their states more competitive in attracting employers and high-skilled workers, simplifying their tax systems and resisting pressure for more government spending as their economies and tax revenue recover gradually from the recession. For Jindal and other Republican governors who have an eye on a presidential run in 2016, there are obvious political benefits to having a robust tax-cutting record to present to conservative primary voters. But they are also taking small first steps into a fundamental debate over what kind of tax system most encourages  or least discourages  growth in a 21st-century economy. In particular, they are focusing more attention on the idea, long championed mostly by conservatives but accepted up to a point by economists of all stripes, that the economy would be better served by focusing taxation on consumption rather than on income. And as they do so they are reigniting an ideological conflict about whether it is possible to move away from a system built around progressive taxation of income without benefiting the wealthy at the expense of middle- and lower-income people. ""The question of whether we should tax income or whether we should tax spending is really a proxy for a different debate,"" said Joseph Henchman, vice president for state projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning research organization. ""Everyone agrees we'll get more growth with consumption taxes. It's just that some people prioritize fairness.""It is not clear whether any of the Republican proposals will make it into law; even in states with Republican-dominated legislatures, governors face difficulty as they pursue their proposals because changing the tax code almost invariably creates losers as well as winners. In addition to keeping a higher sales tax, Brownback has proposed that Kansas help pay for income tax cuts by rescinding deductions for mortgage interest and property tax payments, drawing opposition even from members of his own party. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia is battling to save his plan, announced this month, to end the state's gasoline tax and make up the revenue by increasing the sales tax. And just as President Barack Obama has raised income tax rates on upper-income families, Democratic governors including Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Jerry Brown of California and Deval Patrick of Massachusetts have supported or implemented income tax increases on the wealthy. The shift toward greater reliance on sales taxes is not universal among Republican governors. Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma would rely largely on projections of economic growth to help offset her plan for lower rates and an eventual end to her state's income tax. ""I don't believe greater reliance on the sales tax is likely to be a broad trend in the country, although we may see it in some places,"" said Don Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government who tracks state fiscal policies. ""In recent years voters and politicians have generally shown in a variety of ways that they have been more willing to support tax increases on higher-income taxpayers than on the broad populace."" The shift toward sales taxes in some states is incremental, and nowhere near the scale or complexity that would characterize adoption of a federal consumption tax, whether a value-added tax, a national sales tax or any of the other variations that have been proposed and debated over the years. But where it is happening, the results could resonate in other states and in Washington. Jindal, whose status as a likely candidate for the White House in 2016 has drawn particular attention to his proposal, has signaled that he wants his plan to be revenue neutral, meaning that every dollar of revenue lost from eliminating the personal and corporate income tax would have to be made up elsewhere. The only viable source for making up most of the money is raising the state's sales tax. ""We want to keep the sales tax as low and flat as possible,"" Jindal said in a statement this month outlining his approach. He has not yet settled on any specifics for changing the sales tax, and his aides say he would include safeguards to ensure that lower-income people are not made worse off. ""With consumption taxes, it's all in the details,"" said Tracy Gordon, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who follows state tax and spending policies."\u000a

V"Tommy Arnold will be the ""other"" quarterback tonight, and that's fine with him because he's used to it.The stout 5-foot-8, 215-pound Elk Grove junior mostly will hand the ball to running backs Robert Frazier (2,071 yards, 22 touchdowns), Wadus Parker (1,316 yards, 21 touchdowns) and Spencer Sheff out of the wing-T as the Thundering Herd tries to break down Folsom's defense in tonight's Sac-Joaquin Section Division II championship game at Sacramento State.Arnold will throw on occasion, but not nearly as much as his counterpart  sophomore Jake Browning, the focus of the Bulldogs' prolific spread offense.Browning passed for 699 yards and 10 scores in his varsity debut this season against Woodcreek. He enters tonight's game with 4,763 yards and 58 touchdowns.In comparison, Arnold has passed for 894 yards and eight touchdowns. While he appreciates Browning's skills and achievements, Arnold insists he bows to no one.""He plays his game really well,"" Arnold said with an assuring smile, ""and I play mine. We don't throw much, but we're still pretty good.""Here's the twist: Arnold also will have a shot to chase down Browning. He will take a lot of snaps at linebacker and on the defensive line.""I'll be licking my chops,"" Arnold said. ""It'll be my turn to chase and not be chased.""Said Elk Grove coach Chris Nixon: ""Tommy will come ready. He'll trade his hand-warmer on offense for some forearm pads on defense. I'll be sending the quarterback after the quarterback in a section championship game  crazy.""Arnold did not play in Elk Grove's 17-7 loss to Franklin that decided the Delta Valley Conference crown for off-the-field disciplinary reasons. It ultimately affected the seedings in D-I and D-II.""I take responsibility for that  "" Arnold said. ""I heard that (Elk Grove-Franklin) game through my (bedroom) window. It killed me not to play. But I learned from it.""The 'other' backs  If Elk Grove has the star running backs, Folsom counters with runners who expect to make a difference should the rain and wind become a factor.Unlike recent seasons when Folsom quarterbacks led the team in rushing, the Bulldogs have relied on Bailey Laolagi (694 yards, 12 touchdowns) and Harry Lipnosky (738 yards, six touchdowns). Folsom averages 140.8 rushing yards.""It's added to our offense,"" Folsom co-head coach Troy Taylor said. ""We've got two really good backs.""Looking ahead  Northern California section commissioners will meet Sunday to select teams for five Regionals next weekend: Open, D-I, D-II, D-III and D-IV. The winners will advance to CIF State Bowl games Dec. 14-15 in Carson."\u000a

V"When Sacramento County officials said two years ago that they would have to spend more than $2 billion to meet more stringent environmental requirements to treat wastewater, state regulators responded that the cost was much less.Now, the county has essentially agreed, and sewer rates should be much lower than expected.The Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District, which provides service to 400,000 customers in Sacramento County and West Sacramento, released cost estimates for treatment improvements this month that are as much as 48 percent lower than the original estimate.For homeowners, the average monthly sewer bill is expected to rise from $24 to $45 or $46 in seven years. Previously, the district expected the monthly rate to rise to $68. (Those figures do not include separate costs added by local agencies.)District board members expressed qualified relief about the lowered estimates.""I don't know how good we should feel about this,"" said Don Nottoli, a Sacramento County supervisor. ""It's the difference between the doubling and tripling of rates, but at least it's going in the right direction.""While the costs aren't finalized, the district's updated plans are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars over earlier plans. The money will pay for treatment technology at the district's wastewater treatment plant near Elk Grove.The improvements are needed to meet the requirements of a wastewater discharge permit issued by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board in December 2010.The requirements, regulators say, are necessary to protect the Sacramento River from pollution that hurts people and aquatic life as far as 30 miles downstream from discharge released near the Freeport Bridge.The district has already started raising rates to pay for the improvements, and those raises will continue, although not as much as originally planned. District staff will ask the board, made up of elected officials in the region, to raise rates again sometime next year.The district was able to lower cost estimates for the upgrades because of a pilot project that tested treatment options in three locations, said Prabhakar Somavarapu, director of policy and planning for the district.The permit required the district to do three things, he said: remove ammonia, put in filtration and put in a higher level of disinfection. They can be done in quite a few different ways.The pilot project tested different options and revealed, for instance, that using sand for filtration instead of synthetic membrane costs hundreds of millions of dollars less and is still effective, Somavarapu said.The pilot project, paid for by the district's initial rate increases, was conducted over 12 months through April 2012 at a cost of $18 million.It confirmed the expectations of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board, said Ken Landau, assistant executive officer at the board.""We felt they were being overly conservative and offering the worst-case scenario,"" he said.The original estimate, which the district used while fighting the permit requirements, was completed by a nationally renowned consultant it hired, Carollo Engineers.The state board, in turn, hired its own consulting firm, PG Environmental, to review the Carollo estimate. The review determined that the district's cost was likely to be 35 percent lower than Carollo had projected.The district's estimates were also higher than what was spent to make the same improvements at wastewater plants in Tracy, Lodi, Stockton and Manteca, said Landau.Pat Hume, an Elk Grove City Council member, said he and other directors on the sanitation district board will continue to press for cost reductions. The board's staff expects to continue to make revisions before the project goes out to bid. The improvements must be finished by December 2021, when the permit requirements go into effect.""The savings  if realized  are significant, but this is still a very big expense,"" Hume said.Reggie Jardon, an Elk Grove retiree and ratepayer, agreed.""For people on a fixed income, this is going to be a lot of money,"" he said. ""Any significant raise  and I would call this significant  is going to hurt."""\u000a

V"Five moving parts working as one, the Sheldon Huskies represent the ethos of the teenage basketball dream  winning a championship. The Huskies are a unique collection of two junior stars already being scouted by colleges, two future college football players riding out their last hoops wave and the hot-shot son of a former NBA player with local roots.Together, these players are trying to help Sheldon make history  becoming the first public school from the Sac-Joaquin Section to win a CIF State Division I boys basketball championship.The Huskies (29-5) take on Southern California private-school power Mater Dei of Santa Ana for the large-school title Saturday night at Power Balance Pavilion. Mater Dei (33-2) targets a record ninth state banner.A Sheldon victory over MaxPreps' No. 2-ranked team in the country would stand as one of the area's biggest prep victories, equivalent to Grant's football win over national No. 2 Long Beach Poly in the 2008 CIF State Open Bowl and Oak Ridge's girls toppling national No. 3 Long Beach Poly for the 2010 D-I state basketball championship.  The NBA player's kidRyan Manning looks a lot like his father, Rich. The facial expressions, the calm demeanor, the skill and work ethic. Ryan is a 6-6 forward, yet another skilled junior with good grades. Rich Manning was a 6-10 All-State center for Center High School in 1988, when he averaged 29 points a game. He played at Syracuse and Washington and logged two NBA seasons. Rich is not only a proud father, he's an assistant coach  able to watch up-close and help his son develop as a player. The pride masks the agony of a bulging disc in his back.""He's in terrible pain,"" Ryan said. ""We're close. I'm trying to model my game after his. We watch some of his film from when he played. We talk a lot about the mindset of a game, what I need to do better.""Ryan Manning isn't the last Manning in the pipeline, either. Kid brother Matt is a talented eighth-grade guard for T.R. Smedberg Middle School, which feeds into Sheldon, and a constant presence at Huskies practices. He even films the varsity games.  The coachSheldon coach Joey Rollings grew up playing hockey and basketball in Canada.He coached girls and boys basketball teams to small-school state championships at St. Michael Indian School in St. Michaels, Ariz., on the Navajo Nation reservation. Trips to games, in which Rollings drove the bus, were often eight hours.Some of Rollings' players had lantern-lit homes with dirt floors.Effort was not a problem, however.""The kids loved to play, and it was a great experience,"" said Rollings. ""We'd have the medicine man come by and bless our jerseys. Very neat.""Rollings sought a change and applied to ""100 jobs"" in 2003. He landed the Sheldon post, led the girls basketball team to a Sac-Joaquin Section title in 2006 and the boys to a section three-peat this season.  The football playersKyi Thomas had not played a down of organized football until this past fall.His long reach, 44-inch vertical leap and desire to improve and compete landed the senior a scholarship to play wide receiver at Sacramento State. In high tops, the 6-4 Thomas can hit the three-pointer and play above the rim.""I really feel good for my mom, Nicole, who raised me as a single mom.  I'll have my education paid for,"" Thomas said. ""It's a real lesson to student-athletes  don't put all your eggs in one basket. Play more than one sport.""Senior Nate Iese, a national recruit this past fall, was a 6-5, 250-pound tight end for Sheldon's football team who doubled as a pass-rush specialist. He considered not playing basketball in order to focus on recruiting trips but decided to join the team. Since then, he's been a vital piece to the Huskies: snaring rebounds, taking charges, setting picks. He muscled in two game-clinching free throws to help Sheldon beat Jesuit in the CIF Northern California Regional Division I final.New UCLA football coach Jim Mora took his first recruiting trip to Sacramento and headed to Sheldon's gym. There, he marveled at the big kid with the big arms and muttered, ""I want him.""Iese signed with UCLA.""I'm so glad I played basketball this year because it would've really killed me otherwise,"" Iese said. ""I know my family is really proud.""  The junior mintsDakarai Allen would love to borrow some 60 pounds from his uncle, Larry Allen, the retired, 325-pound NFL lineman who was an 11-time Pro Bowl player and won a Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys. As it stands, Dakarai Allen is slender at 6-foot-6 with long limbs and a broad smile. Still growing, Allen gets his height from a 7-foot great-grandfather.Allen's running mate, D'Erryl Williams, is the team's 6-3 point guard with a linebacker's build and leadership qualities required for any title team.Allen has a 3.5 grade-point average with courses in chemistry and Spanish III. Williams is a 4.0 student, whose classes include physics. Both are attracting much college recruiting interest, including the Pacific-12 Conference.""Basketball is our life, our college future,"" Allen said.Allen and Williams share similar statistics, leading Sheldon in scoring, rebounding and assists. Allen averages 14.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.5 steals. Williams goes for 13.8 points, 7.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 3.0 steals.They are extra-motivated to win Saturday for 6-3 guard Armani Hampton, another junior, who is sidelined by a knee injury."\u000a

V"A group of wealthy investors is expected any day to announce it hopes to buy the Sacramento Kings and keep them in town by building an arena at Downtown Plaza.The idea of turning Downtown Plaza into an arena isn't new. The shopping mall isn't doing well, and is due for a rethink. But the city has been focusing its arena ambitions for years on the downtown railyard, several blocks to the north.So, which is a better site for an arena? (We're looking from a transportation, or people-moving, perspective here. Cost is a different question. No price has been set yet for a Downtown Plaza arena.)Interviews with city, Regional Transit, Caltrans and rail officials suggest this preliminary conclusion:Downtown Plaza appears to be the better choice for getting 18,000 people in and out of events en masse.It starts with the fact that the city is planning to build a major transit center in the railyard behind the depot, big enough to handle up to 15 million people annually on trains, buses, taxis and light rail. The site needs space for parking, rental cars and car drop-off zones.It would be ideal to team the transit center with an event center  like Madison Square Garden and Penn Station in Manhattan.But the chosen railyard site south of the rail tracks is small. An arena's hefty size demands would force planners to shrink the transit center and could lead to design concessions that reduce the center's usability long-term.In contrast, the Downtown Plaza site is a two-block walk from the transit center. That's not as good as next door. But it's not bad, and it gives the transit center space to grow.Downtown Plaza looks to be the better arena location for light rail. All three RT light-rail lines have stations near the plaza. That proximity could encourage more people to leave their cars at home or in a park-and-ride lot and take rail to events. The railyard, in contrast, is served by one light-rail line.Most arena users will come in cars. On that score, the plaza appears a better bet because it is closer to more garages and has a surrounding street grid already in place. It also has underground parking on site. If arena builders can preserve a chunk of that parking, it could serve as the required premium parking for big-ticket customers.Then there is pedestrian congestion. Downtown Plaza users would disperse in four directions to garages (amid existing restaurants, bars and stores.) In contrast, a railyard arena may be walled on two sides by the river and train tracks, sending most pedestrians south across I Street.Interstate 5 access to both sites is similar. But south-of-plaza garage users would also drive to the W/X freeway.Our experts say, however, it's too early to anoint one site. The city must do studies first. That is, if the Kings don't run off to Seattle in the meantime."\u000a

V"McClatchy High School athletic director Rob Feickert wasn't shy about adding an extra helping to his plate Friday at the midtown Old Spaghetti Factory.Each year, captains, coaches and administrators from Sacramento High and McClatchy meet the day before the annual Bell Game to talk about the tradition, history and importance of the area's oldest football rivalry.McClatchy (3-6, 3-3) plays at 1 p.m. today at Sacramento (7-2, 5-1) in the Metro Conference regular-season finale, the 78th game between the two schools that first played each other in 1937.""The school that hosts the game picks up the tab,"" Feickert said Thursday. ""So this year I won't hold back. I'll probably have an extra entree or two.""And he should. Feickert has a unique connection with the rivalry.He played at Sac High in the early 1980s, and then coached football at McClatchy in two stints over eight years before stepping away in 2006.""Back when I played at Sac, we all knew the kids at McClatchy because the schools are so close together,"" Feickert said. ""You knew if you won that game you'd have the rest of your life to hold it over them.""McClatchy's Kevin ""Kaycee"" Clark is the guy who still has bragging rights over Feickert. Clark had three interceptions in helping the Lions beat Feickert's Dragons in 1981.Clark, who went on to play for the Denver Broncos, took a nostalgic tour of his alma mater during a visit earlier in the week. The Colorado resident loved rekindling his big-game performance with Feickert.But the Bell Game also has lost a bit of its chime.There are no more crowds of 26,000 fans that packed Hughes Stadium for the game in 1947, when it was played on Thanksgiving Day and called the Turkey Game. That's reportedly the largest ever for a prep game in Sacramento.The two schools are no longer football juggernauts. McClatchy hasn't been to a playoff game since 1996, although the Dragons have enjoyed a recent resurrection under coach Paul Doherty and his predecessor Doug Cosbie. A win today would match the Dragons' best record since 1993.Even more critical was Sacramento becoming a charter school in 2003. The campus now draws students from beyond the Sacramento City Unified School District boundaries.""That's changed the game significantly, although there are still some neighborhood kids at Sac,"" Feickert said. ""We don't know each other as much.""Despite those changes, Sac High athletic director Justin Gatling says his school looks forward to the game every season. The Dragons have won the last three games, and Gatling says the perpetual Bell trophy is rolled out the week of the game to boost school spirit.""It's a great tradition for our kids, our school and the city,"" Gatling said. ""The captains' luncheon solidifies how important the rivalry is.""The game will return to Hughes Stadium next season when McClatchy hosts.The last time the two teams played at the historic stadium, recently renovated, was in 2006, when a crowd of 5,500 gathered.Sac also is open to playing at Hughes in future years.""It would be great to get back there some day, though we have a great field,"" Gatling said. ""It's just a matter if everything as far as costs can be worked out."""\u000a

V"Hundreds of Catholic faithful made their way before a traveling statue of Our Lady of Fatima on Thursday to offer up personal prayers, but also some for the world.""It's an opportunity for the parish to renew devotion to her,"" said the Rev. Giancarlo Mittempergher of Holy Cross Parish in West Sacramento.The statue is a representation of the Virgin Mary, who reportedly appeared to three children in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917. It has traveled around the world since 1947, when it was made based on the description given by one of the children. Another statue is enshrined in Fatima.The traveling statue, elaborately hand-carved in mahogany, was carefully carried into the Holy Cross church amid a chorus of hymns.""Ave, ave, ave Maria,"" parishioners sang in unison, alternating between Spanish and English.Devotees have said it is not uncommon to see miracles happen in the presence of Fatima. Some pilgrims have reported seeing tears stream from the statue's eyes.""Look into her eyes with prayers and your problems,"" statue custodian Patrick Sabat told the crowd. ""Mary will surely listen.""In the statue's 65-year history, it has traveled to more than 100 countries, including Russia and China. Fatima's caretakers said they receive visit requests from all over the world.This was Mittempergher's second time in the statue's presence. The priest related how the same statue visited a South African church while he served as a missionary there.""She must not be touched,"" he said. ""She will touch you.""After the statue was officially installed in the Holy Cross sanctuary, scores of parishioners lined up to catch a better glimpse. Some even kneeled down, crying. White roses were placed beneath the statue, along with boxes for donations and prayers.Parishioner A. Paul Martinez, 56, ""looked into her eyes"" and prayed. ""Miracles have happened with Fatima in current times,"" Martinez said.Jesus Guzman, a 23-year member of Holy Cross Parish, offered to ""pray for the consecration for all people who don't believe in Christ. We pray for the whole world,"" he said.The traveling Lady of Fatima remains at Holy Cross until noon today, then moves on to St. Dominic's in Benicia."\u000a

V"The first two meetings this high school basketball season between Jesuit and Sheldon were for area rankings and position in the Delta River League standings.Game 3 was for the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I boys championship.The bell will ring for Round 4 tonight at Power Balance Pavilion, the winner fitted for the CIF Northern California Regional large-school championship belt and a date to play for the state crown.Never in the 30-year history of the NorCal tournament have two Sacramento-area boys met for a larger-school regional championship.What makes this historic game even more enduring to fans is that Jesuit and Sheldon are defined by their skill and sportsmanship, performing at a high level without bravado or venom. These rivals appreciate and respect each other.""Two teams in the final is huge for this area,"" Jesuit coach Greg Harcos said. ""You always hear about how the Bay Area is tougher and better than this area. But we're pretty good here, too.""Pretty good, indeed.Opened in 1997 in the Elk Grove Unified School District, Sheldon (28-5) beat Jesuit in their first three meetings  by 18, one and five points. A junior-heavy team, Sheldon has played beyond its years. Leading the way are junior point guard D'Erryl Williams and 6-foot-6 Dakarai Allen.A regional academic and athletic presence since the 1960s, Jesuit (27-6) is a senior-laden group headed by versatile guards Bryce Pressley and Parker Uu and point guard Akachi Okugo.Both teams pulled for each other to get here. Jesuit used a 14-3 closing run in Tuesday's semifinal to topple top-seeded De La Salle of Concord 44-41. Meanwhile, Sheldon polished off McClymonds of Oakland in the other semifinal. Sheldon and Jesuit ensured that an East Bay team would not reach the D-I final for the first time. Only three Sacramento-area schools have reached the NorCal D-I final: Jesuit (six), Sheldon (two) and Valley (one). Only Jesuit in 1993 and '94 won the NorCal title before falling to national power Crenshaw of Los Angeles in the state finals both time.Getting to this point alone is an accomplishment.""I don't think people realize how hard it is to do this, to win this many games against good teams,"" Williams said.Added Pressley: ""It's crazy. It shows how strong Sacramento is, especially the DRL. Jesuit and Sheldon know each other so well, what plays we run, and that makes it fun. I'm really excited. We all are.""Allen may have been speaking for the region when he said: ""We finally got over the hump. We've lost some close games in the NorCals before.""Sheldon coach Joey Rollings told his team following the win over McClymonds: ""We're so close to our dream. If we make it to the state finals, we're winning. I know it. But we know how good Jesuit is, and you know they're coming after us.""Williams and Pressley epitomize their teams.They handle the ball, shoot and defend well. They are also sons of former players  D'Erryl Williams Sr. played at Santa Clara, and Harold Pressley played at Villanova and for the Kings. Their sons fought through injuries this season. Williams dislocated his right little finger while Pressley  as well as Uu  battled an assortment of ailments.""Right now, it's heart and guts,"" said Harcos.Today's favorite? Many will point to Sheldon, which has beaten Jesuit seven consecutive times over three seasons.Can the momentum hold up?""To win the championship, you have to beat the best teams,"" Harcos said. ""We feel extremely lucky to have another chance."""\u000a

V"Mary Jo Truesdale has been coaching high school softball for more than 30 years.But she has not seen a team like this season's Sheldon bunch.The Huskies confounded her as they sputtered throughout the regular season. Then they wound up finding a special place in her heart.Sheldon, completing one of the Sac-Joaquin Section's most improbable playoff runs, beat Ponderosa 8-1 for its second consecutive Division I title Wednesday at the Sacramento Softball Complex.Ponderosa (22-9) defeated Sheldon (21-9) twice in winning the Delta River League, and the Bruins also deserved a thank you from the Huskies. They enabled Sheldon to back into the playoffs as a No. 3 seed by beating St. Francis 1-0 on the last day of the regular season after the Huskies lost 4-2 to Pleasant Grove.Sheldon went 6-0 in the postseason. In their last five games, the Huskies outscored their opponents 70-6 and had 81 hits. They had 11 hits against Ponderosa, led by senior catcher MeShalon Moore's 4-for-4 performance, including a towering home run in the third inning.Sheldon senior pitcher Alexis Cooper scattered four hits as the Huskies captured their fifth section championship.""We've never had a season as full of so many episodes of ups and downs  it's remarkable,"" Truesdale said. ""We knew this team was a talented group, but during the season things didn't always click. But once we got to the playoffs, they really connected as a team, and offensively they kept feeding off each other.""This team definitely has a special place. It will leave good memories with me.""In other divisional championship games:Woodcreek 3, Del Campo 2  With her team down to its last out and trailing 2-0, Jenna Curtan hit a two-run single, then Christal Vierra blooped a single over short to complete the Timberwolves' dramatic rally over the scrappy Cougars (16-9-1) in the D-II championship game.Curtan's hit barely eluded the Del Campo first baseman, and Vierra's pop-up bounced off the glove of a backpedaling Cougars shortstop. Curtan, a sophomore outfielder who led the Timberwolves (26-4) with three hits, set up the winning run by stealing second and then hustled home on Vierra's hit.""Little Jenna has really played her heart out,"" Woodcreek coach Art Banks said of Curtan, a .400 hitter. ""She's been on fire at the plate. And she has all kinds of speed, so it's hard to get her out.""Bear River 9, Whitney 3  Despite the flu, senior shortstop Stephanie Ceo hit two home runs, including a grand slam, to send veteran Bruins coach Duane Zauner into retirement on a high note in the Division III final against the Wildcats (20-12).""It's going to be hard to leave  but it's time for Z to go,"" said Zauner, who has coached at Bear River since the school opened in 1986, including the last 18 years as softball coach. ""I'm really proud of these girls. We started the season 1-4, but they didn't panic, and they didn't quit. They got the momentum and kept it going.""It was Bear River's fifth section title in six years. The Bruins (20-6-2) won four consecutive D-IV titles from 2007 to 2010 before realignment moved them up a division."\u000a

V"BEIJING  China's leaders have tried honoring Ai Weiwei and bribing him with the offer of high positions. They have tried jailing him, fining him and clubbing him so brutally that he needed emergency brain surgery. In desperation, they have even begged him to behave  and nothing works. What is the Politburo to do with a superstar artist with a vast global audience like Ai (whose name is pronounced EYE Way-way), who makes a video of himself dancing ""Gangnam style"" with handcuffs  parodying the Chinese state  that quickly ends up with more than 1 million views on YouTube? How should the Central Committee of the Communist Party react when Ai releases a nude self-portrait with a stuffed animal as a fig leaf? The caption was ""grass-mud-horse in the center""  a homonym in Chinese for a vulgar curse against the Communist Party's central leadership. Or, more precisely, against its mother. One thing the party detests even more than being denounced is being mocked, and humor is the signature element of Ai's assaults. Other dissidents, like the great writer Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel Peace Prize winner now in prison, write eloquently of democracy but gain little traction among ordinary Chinese: Ai's artistic work also seems incomprehensible to many people, but obscene jokes about grass-mud-horses can get more traction  and be difficult to quash. ""I think they don't know how to handle someone like me,"" Ai said in an interview. ""They kind of give up managing me."" One challenge for the Communist Party is that Ai, 55, is one of the world's great artists. He also comes from a family with close ties to the Communist revolution, and his mother and father were friendly with the parents of China's new top leader, Xi Jinping. Ai's emergence as an icon of resistance represents progress in China, a reflection of an unofficial pluralism that is gaining ground. China increasingly reminds me of South Korea or Taiwan in the early 1980s, when an educated middle class was nibbling away at dictatorship. There is real improvement in China, Ai acknowledges, and he says that he expects democracy to reach China by 2020  but he laments that it is already overdue. ""They have wasted a whole generation of young people,"" he said. Ai's irreverence seems shaped by the dozen years he spent in New York City burnishing his artistic reputation. He returned to China in 1993, at the age of 36, and initially behaved himself politically and played a role in designing the magnificent Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. One factor that changed him was the terrible earthquake of 2008 in Sichuan province in the southwest, when schools collapsed and the government clamped down on parents protesting shoddy construction. Ai backed the parents and began to demand more openness from the government. Angered by his antagonism, the authorities had Ai beaten up and then destroyed his studio in Shanghai. Then last year the government detained him for nearly three months. The authorities still block him from traveling abroad, so he is not able to attend a major exhibition of his work now under way at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum in Washington. The pressure left Ai feeling more strongly than ever that one of China's biggest problems is autocratic government. He became more outspoken, not less. ""At every step, they pushed me into it,"" he said. ""I told them, 'You create people like me.' "" After briefly lying low after his imprisonment, Ai has resumed his political pranks. Mocking the authorities for installing 15 cameras to monitor his movements, he broadcast a public ""weiweicam"" on the Internet with a feed from his bedroom so the government could keep an even closer eye on him. ""They almost begged me to turn it off,"" he said with a grin. At the end of a long conversation, I asked Ai if he had anything else to say. ""China still needs help from the U.S.,"" he said. ""To insist on certain values, that is the role of the U.S. That is the most important product of American culture. When Hillary Clinton talks about Internet freedom, I think that's really beautiful."" There's a message there for Americans. We have a powerful military, yes, but the ""hard power"" of missiles is often exceeded by our ""soft power"" of ideas. Speaking up for our values around the world invariably raises questions of hypocrisy and inconsistency, but it's better to be an inconsistent advocate of democracy and human rights than to be a consistent advocate of nothing. I hope the White House listens to how Ai responded when I asked if President Barack Obama was doing enough to raise human rights concerns. ""I don't know what they're doing under the table,"" Ai said. ""But on the surface, they're not doing enough."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2010/10/06/3085590/study-slams-confusion-waste-in.html,"WASHINGTON  A report alleging that the Obama administration squelched efforts by government scientists to publicize the size of BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill wasn't the only study critical of the government's response released Wednesday.A second report, entitled Decision-Making in the Unified Command, portrays the cleanup effort as confused, wasteful and often ineffective, and offers thinly veiled criticism of some of the key figures in the effort, including Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.Allen, who President Barack Obama appointed as the National Incident Commander to oversee the response, saw the center he ran as intended primarily to deal with high-level political and media inquiries and not to direct the response effort, the report said. As a result, the public was confused about who was in charge of the response, the report said.Jindal became an obstacle to the response, the report said, when, 11 days into the disaster, he removed the state's on-scene commander and named himself to the post. No one else had the authority to speak for the state, so all decisions had to flow through the governor's office, which slowed decision-making and caused problems in the response efforts, the report said. The governor's office disputed the characterization, saying Jindal had never appointed himself as the state's on-scene coordinator (see the update below).One major misstep, this report said, was the Obama administration's decision in late May, as it was being slammed in the news media for responding too slowly, to triple the federal manpower and resources devoted to the spill.Coast Guard responders believed they were already throwing every resource they had at fighting the spill, but they dutifully tripled personnel and tracked their progress, at least for the state of Louisiana, in a regular report entitled 'Status of Tripling,' the report said.The result was wasted resources and effort, the report concluded.For example, the report said, (Allen's) staff believed they needed to buy every skimmer they could find, even though they were hearing that responders on the ground had enough skimmers. . . . At the very least, tracking the 'status on tripling' was probably not the most important task for front line responders to be undertaking.The battle for oil-containing boom among the states was another major drain on resources, the report found.Because boom became a symbol of how responsive the government was to local communities, the report said, boom was placed everywhere, including in passes where swift tidal currents rendered it ineffective, and in places where it was unlikely to encounter oil.Responders were frustrated with the time they spent laying what was, in their view, unnecessary boom, the report said.BP made the situation worse, the report said, by announcing on May 5 that it would give each Gulf coast state $25 million to spend as it saw fit. It subsequently gave Louisiana another $25 million and made smaller grants of $500,000 to $1 million to individual parishes.This money may also have had a detrimental effect on the overall response efforts, the report said. For example, some of the money was spent by states and parishes to purchase boom directly, limiting the overall supply of boom available to the unified command and making it difficult for the unified command to make sure that the boom got to locations where it would be most helpful and not cause any additional environmental damage.UPDATE: Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's staff on Thursday disputed the contention that he had been an obstacle to the recovery and said that he'd never appointed himself to be the state's on-scene coordinator. ""There are several errors throughout this report and we called the Commission to inform them of the errors,"" an e-mailed statement said, attributing the comment to Garret Graves, chairman of the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority and Jindal's coastal affairs advisor. ""They said this was still a draft report and they were working to revise and correct it. One of the most obvious errors is that the Governor was never named State on Scene Coordinator. Roland Guidry served in that role until he rotated back to Baton Rouge on May 31st and Jerome Zeringue then assumed that position.ON THE WEBStaff Working Paper from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore DrillingMORE FROM MCCLATCHYReport: White House squelched release of BP oil spill estimatesOil spill's national command center closes, Allen takes new jobLawsuit asks if science was manipulated in oil spill estimatesGovernment doubles previous oil flow estimate for BP wellCheck out McClatchy's expanded politics coverage at Planet WashingtonMore McClatchy oil spill coverageCheck out McClatchy's politics blog: Planet Washington"\u000a

""I understand how hectic it gets.""Attending Stanford has been one of Lealao's lifetime goals, as much for student life (he sings in the school choir and is involved in student government), future business prospects (he and another Capital Christian student are developing a clothing line) and school colors (""I've always loved red"") as for the Cardinal's outstanding football program.But Lealao hasn't verbally committed to Stanford despite admitting he was ""in shock"" when coach David Shaw offered a scholarship after Lealao attended a camp on campus last summer.""Ever since I've been a little kid, I've wanted to go to Stanford,"" he said. ""After attending the football camp and seeing the campus, I could envision myself being there.""But I also realize that picking a college will be a lifetime decision. So I plan to take all five of my official trips (next fall and winter) to explore what else is out there.""Capital Christian boys basketball coach Devon Jones calls Lealao ""an amazing kid,"" and not just because he averages a team-leading 12.4 points as well as 6.9 rebounds for the 19-2 Cougars.""He's like no other kid I have met in my lifetime,"" Jones said. ""He's a football All-American, yet he's also a great basketball and volleyball player. He's a 4.0 student, sings in the choir, serves on the student council, and when he's not doing all those things, he's in the chapel praying. He's our leader.""Rugged Metro  With No. 1 Sacramento, No. 3 Kennedy, No. 5 McClatchy and No. 11 Florin, the Metro Conference ranks as the Sac-Joaquin Section's second toughest in girls basketball behind the Delta River League.Even with struggling Hiram Johnson and Valley, the Metro is the best Sacramento's Michele Massari has seen in her five seasons as the Dragons' coach. Kennedy's Dave Parsh, whose Cougars aspire to repeat as D-I section champions, agreed.""McClatchy is young but up-and-coming,"" Parsh said. ""Florin has been good the last three years; Sacramento's been good forever.

V"Staying power and results.The theme resonates for those regional high school football programs that seamlessly reload every fall. Grant led all area programs with a 118-19 record over the past 10 seasons. The Pacers of Del Paso Heights also led the region in victories the previous decade under coach Mike Alberghini, now in his 22nd season with a 221-38 record.Del Oro is 111-29 since 2001 with coach Casey Taylor, Colfax 110-21-1 with Tony Martello as coach, Granite Bay 106-30-1 with Ernie Cooper, Nevada Union 97-33 with Dave Humphers and Del Campo 92-36 with Mike Dimino.The schools combined to win or share 46 league championships and 14 Sac-Joaquin Section titles in that 10-year stretch. The key has been continuity in coaches, administrative and community support with a surplus of athletes motivated by tradition. But ambitious early-season scheduling will challenge area powers in 2012. Del Oro and Granite Bay, for instance, play state powers Oaks Christian and Westlake this weekend in the Battle for Veterans in Loomis. That will be followed by a Sept. 21 Bee-ranked showdown when No. 4 Grant hosts No. 2 Del Oro.""It's sustaining the success that's the challenge,"" said Alberghini. ""You have to be ready every Monday for a hard week because there are so many good teams.""Grant isn't expected to slow down in the coming years, either. Alberghini said of Grant's junior varsity team: ""My God, they're so fast, with great size. It's a fabulous JV team, but sustaining it  .""Around the regions  After seven years as Cal's football radio analyst, Troy Taylor has stepped away to join best friend Kris Richardson as co-coaches at Folsom. Said Richardson: ""What a great coach, and he's added years to my life. I think I'll survive the season now."" Capital Christian coach Phil Grams said 6-foot-5, 280-pound junior lineman Nifae Lealao has drawn every Pacific-12 Conference coach to the campus, including a Stanford scholarship offer. Rio Linda coach Mike Morris said he has two good running backs in senior Lamar Bible and sophomore Marcel Brown, who is capable of ""becoming the best back we've ever had, and we've had great ones."" Laguna Creek coach Dave Morton expects a big season out of senior linebacker Davonte Castex, who impressed in a scrimmage against Folsom on Saturday. Sheldon coach Herb Berry likes the early efforts of defensive back/receiver Taron Johnson, the team's most physical player, and quarterback Nolan Merker, a student with a 4.23 grade-point average. The next quarterback for Casa Roble, a program known to throw a bit, is junior Peyton Wilfley. Coach Norm Ryan says he could ""break every passing record we've had."" First-year El Dorado coach Joe Volek said the challenge is immense in returning success to Placerville, but the pieces are there. Volek inherits 14 eager seniors and a 2-year-old field that represents a new era. First-year Florin coach Mike Rosales recently invited former Florin and NFL lineman Ephraim Salaam to campus to speak to players about achieving dreams. Salaam will be a Panthers honorary captain this fall. River City coaches Steve DaPrato and Chris Baker are back in coaching because, ""We failed retirement,"" DaPrato said."\u000a

Just beyond the end zone, El Camino principal Jill Spears was planning a summer getaway, courtesy of the Colfax principal, Rick Spears, Jill's husband.""Colfax beat us the last couple of times, and Rick got to pick the vacation spot, but now I think Jill is counting on a nice trip to Europe,"" Reinking joked Monday afternoon.

V"The players and coaches from tiny Fruitland High School in Idaho saw themselves as ambassadors for their state's brand of gritty football when they ventured 550 miles to play in Saturday's Football for Families fundraising showcase in El Dorado Hills.They made believers out of those who found their way to Oak Ridge High School for a rare morning game, the first of four games that rounded out the two-day, seven-game benefit for foster families.Behind their immensely talented and inspiring leader, senior quarterback-linebacker Joey Martarano, Fruitland overcame injuries, the loss of an early lead and the fatigue of so many players playing both ways in rising temperatures to top Casa Roble 29-22.""It's just a great experience to see how we stack up against a big California school, and it's a big win for us,"" said Martarano, who has led his school to five state championships in three sports. ""Maybe this will help for other Idaho teams to be able to come down here.""Though it has played in Idaho's last six 3A state title games, Fruitland (3-0) is a school of 500 students, nearly three times smaller than Casa Roble (1-2), which has a team that platoons its players and a sophisticated spread offense rarely seen in the Gem State.Fruitland overcame injuries to 6-foot-4, 240-pound tight end-defensive end Alec Dhaenens, a Boise State verbal recruit (left knee injury) and sophomore running back-defensive back Kody Graves (fractured right leg).But the Grizzlies still had Martarano.The 6-4, 230-pounder has already verbally committed to Boise State to play linebacker, but the gifted slugger could be a first-round pick in baseball's free-agent draft in June.""I've coached 35 years and I can't remember having another one like him,"" said Fruitland coach Bruce Schlaich. ""He does it all. He feels no pressure. The bigger the situation, the more he steps up.""With Martarano leading the way, Fruitland held Casa Roble on its 12-yard line early in the fourth quarter, then drove the Grizzlies 88 yards, rushing for the stay-ahead touchdown and two-point conversion with 6:08 left.After Fruitland forced a Casa Roble fumble near midfield with 5:17 to play, Martarano helped the Grizzlies run out the clock with several up-the-gut runs with defenders clawing and scratching at him to try to jar the ball loose.""Joey is a man-child, an excellent football player,"" said Casa Roble coach Norm Ryan. ""He made the plays that had to be made. He wanted it more than anyone on the field.""Martarano, who completed eight of 10 passes for 134 yards and rushed for 67 yards on 18 carries, said the injuries to Dhaenens and Graves only steeled his resolve despite the fatigue, heat and ""air that is a lot different than in Idaho.""""We wanted to win it for them,"" Martarano said.Fruitland limited Casa Roble's usually potent offense (471 yards per game coming in) to 224 total yards.The Grizzlies pressured quarterback Peyton Wilfley (12 for 22 for 122 yards) throughout the day, sacking him five times and allowing few big pass plays.Fruitland also held area rushing leader Kody Jones (averaging 205 yards coming in) to 64 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries.""We knew it was going to be a struggle because all our players are 48-minute ironmen,"" Schlaich said. ""But they're extremely tough, physically and mentally, and we're just so proud of them. To come down and beat a school like Casa Roble is a big feather in our cap."""\u000a

V"The gray brick wall is plain and is a constant reminder for the St. Francis girls volleyball team of what is expected.A feature of that wall is, the ""hole,"" a blank space that separates the American flag and the 2005 Division III state title banner. It's a daily reminder of the ultimate goal.The top-seeded Troubadours are one win away from filling the ""hole"" after defeating visiting Granite Bay in the Division I Northern California CIF state championship 3-1 (16-25, 26-24, 25-20, 25-15) on Tuesday night.""Every day we are looking at the hole, and now we have a chance to fill it,"" senior outside hitter Gabby Palmeri said. ""This is the closest we have been and it is incredible.""Granite Bay (41-7) looked like a team with nothing to lose. The Grizzlies sought to avenge a 3-0 loss to St. Francis in the Sac-Joaquin Section final two weeks ago, and perhaps a loss by the same score in their season opener.But it will be St. Francis (38-2) that will try for its second state title, and its first since 2005 in Division III.""It's unbelievable because from the beginning of the season the girls had the hopes and the dream and the goal,"" coach Alynn Wright said. ""But in the volleyball community that was we were going to (win). But it is a lot of pressure. It felt a lot like David and Goliath.""St. Francis was down 1-0 and trailing in the second game with Palmeri on the bench because Wright felt the senior was trying to do too much.Dangerously close to trailing 2-0 for the second time this season, St. Francis got within 20-19. Palmeri, affectionately called ""Captain Gabby"" by her coach and teammates, got back on the court and rallied her team with three kills in the last four points to take the second set for a 26-24 win.From there, St. Francis took over and showed why it was the No. 1 team by The Bee all season and the D-I top seed.But it wasn't all that easy for Wright and her players.""The expectation that (the players) had, the community had and just the expectations here high,"" Wright said.And playing Granite Bay for a third time was no easy task, either.""It's hard to play a good team that is playing well for a third time,"" Wright said. ""I knew that they would come in with confidence and carefree because they didn't have that expectation.""St. Francis has a strong senior class led by Palmeri, Loni Kreun, Allie Wegener, Allison Child and Hannah Liserra  but it was the help from the underclassmen that helped seal the comeback for the deepest and arguably most talented team this season.While Palmeri was on the bench, junior Anna Baytosh stepped in and led the rally with strong net play.""We had to have other people step up,"" junior setter Ali Koumelis said. ""Anna did a great job when she came in. It was hard to see Gabby on the bench.""Koumelis spent the match digging out serves by the amazing outside hitters of Maddy Deters and Nicolette Pinkney of Granite Bay, and she finished off the St. Francis win with a soft- touch kill that fell between two Grizzlies.The point set off a celebration seven years in the making for St. Francis, which will play Marymount of Los Angeles (33-5) for the D-I state title Saturday at Concordia University in Irvine.""I still can't believe it. I keep pinching myself to see if this is real,"" Palmeri said. ""I keep asking people if this is real. I will find out tomorrow, I guess.""Division II  Playing in its first NorCal championship, El Camino (35-6) lost 3-0 (25-11, 25-16, 25-22) to No. 2 nationally ranked Archbishop Mitty (37-0) in San Jose."\u000a

His teammates call him ""Freak"" for his ability to race past bigger tackles and for his weight-room prowess.Claiborne remains low-key by nature, but he is also playing with a heavy heart.

V"NEW YORK  Small-business owners may be closer to losing an advantage they've enjoyed during the e-commerce boom  being exempt from collecting sales tax in states where they're not located. And they're worried they will have to spend more money in the process. Under federal law, a state or local government cannot force a company to collect sales tax on a purchase unless the business has a physical presence in that state. The physical presence could range from an actual store to an office, warehouse or distribution center. The sale could be conducted online, over the phone or through mail-order. The arrangement saves money for shoppers who use price comparison websites or mobile apps, and those who spend time surfing for the best overall deal. But Washington lawmakers have several bills in the works that would end all that by forcing companies to collect the tax. Businesses are split over the issue. On one side are small retailers who say they wouldn't be able to bear the costs of collecting the tax and filing reports and tax returns that states and local governments require. They're worried they'll have to buy software, hire staffers and deal with the continual hassle of keeping up with collecting tax from states and thousands of municipalities. Headsets.com, for instance, might have to hire two staffers to handle the administrative work if what's called remote tax collection becomes law, says CEO Mike Faith. The company has operations in California and Tennessee, but sells to all 50 states. Currently, federal law only requires the company to collect tax in those two states. Faith expects the law would force him to hire workers to help his San Francisco-based company comply with it. ""It's useless employment. It doesn't add value to the company,"" he says. ""It's just another cost burden.""On the other side are in-state sellers and larger retailers with physical locations dotted across the country who sometimes lose business to competitors who don't have to collect the tax. Even if two retailers charge the same amount price for an item, many shoppers choose the seller that doesn't collect taxes to reduce their overall cost. ""It's a problem that needs to be addressed. It's an un-level playing field,"" says David French, a lobbyist for the National Retail Federation. And on yet another side are the state and local governments that stand to gain billions in uncollected revenue if a bill makes it through Congress. States have wanted the tax money for decades and are particularly anxious for it now because their tax revenue is down following the recession and the housing crisis. The payoff could be substantial. In 2012, there was as much as $11.4 billion in uncollected taxes on Internet sales alone, according to an estimate by University of Tennessee researchers. State and local government officials have wanted to change the law for years, even before the catalog boom of the 1980s and the Internet boom of the '90s. Small-business owners have resisted along the way. They argue that the burden of keeping up with the estimated 15,000 different sales tax rates charged by the 7,500 to 9,600 jurisdictions made up of states, counties, cities and towns, is just too much. They have a point. Knowing how much to tax, and where, can be complicated. For example, Elgin, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, is located in two counties, Cook and Kane. In Cook County, Elgin's sales tax on general merchandise is 9.25 percent. In Kane, it's 8.25 percent. The state's base sales tax is 6.25 percent. What is taxed also varies widely. In Massachusetts, baby oil is tax-free, but baby lotion and powder aren't. In states including New York, there's a tax on shipping charges on items. Others, including California, don't charge if you get merchandise delivered by the U.S. Postal Service or delivery services like UPS and FedEx. The effort to change the law intensified as Internet growth increased and companies' out-of-state sales volume swelled. Many sellers felt protected by a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states could not force out-of-state sellers to collect sales tax. But the court, in effect, invited Congress to create a law that would give states the authority to require that taxes be collected. States have a lot of incentive to go after the revenue. The combined budgets of all the states had deficits of more than $100 billion a year from 2009 through 2012, primarily because of the drop in tax receipts during and after the recession, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, an organization that studies tax issues. Three separate bills were introduced in the last Congress that would authorize the states to require remote sellers to collect taxes.In the Senate, the Marketplace Fairness Act had bipartisan support but did not come to a vote. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., one of the bill's sponsors, has said the bill was tabled because of concerns by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., about the burdens tax collection would place on companies in his state, where there is no sales tax.But the burden small-business owners fear may not be as bad as they think. The government would likely require that states make the process easier for small companies. And the smallest of these businesses are expected to be exempt. The proposed Marketplace Fairness Act exempts businesses that have $500,000 or less in sales from remote states. But Durbin says that number is open to negotiation."\u000a

V"Mark Lyon is a natural leader.The senior quarterback and linebacker spent much of a hot, sweaty Saturday afternoon prodding, motivating and inspiring his exhausted, undermanned Rio Americano High School teammates during their nonleague game against visiting Davis.So with the Raiders trailing the Blue Devils 21-20 with 1:51 to play, Lyon decided to take matters into his own hands and get the right result from the wrong decision.In a play Lyon admitted probably should have gone to fullback Darrin Nishi, Lyon kept the ball, dodged a sea of tacklers and tiptoed along the right sideline, then dived into the end zone for a 14-yard touchdown to give the Raiders (2-2) an unexpected 26-21 win over the Blue Devils (2-2).""It was an option read for me and the fullback, and I probably didn't make the right read,"" Lyon said. ""But I saw the hole and thought I could get outside.""The touchdown came a few plays after the game was stopped for 25 minutes while officials waited for medics to arrive to treat two Rio Americano cheerleaders who had suffered apparent heat stroke.Before the stoppage, the Raiders had driven from their 25 with 7:33 left to the Davis 12 with 2:28 to play.""We were just trying not to tighten or cramp up and to stay focused because it was such a big game for us,"" said Lyon who rushed for 85 yards and two touchdowns and passed for 134 yards and a score.When Christian Mahaffey took over as the Rio Americano coach four years ago, the first thing he looked at was grooming a quarterback.He saw a gem in the 5-foot-11, 185-pound Lyon.""Mark had never played quarterback,"" Mahaffey said. ""But he's tough, hardnosed and a winner. There's more to playing that position than just throwing the ball. You want someone who can take a hit and show his teammates that he can get up.""Lyon did that plenty of times Saturday as he and fellow D-III Raiders Zack Saurez, Robert Crandall, Guillermo Salazar, Ryan Burns, Jordan Vinson and Tommy Knapp played most of the game on both sides against the Division I Blue Devils, who had outscored their last two opponents (Foothill and Armijo) 102-7 and may have their best team in five years.Lyon's reps at linebacker increased a little more when middle linebacker Connor Shatz had to be carted off the field with 8:10 to go with a leg and hip injury and a cut lip.""We're used to it,"" Lyon said of playing both ways in blistering heat. ""Small numbers for football has kind of been Rio's thing. We knew we needed to get this win to turn around our season.""Now Rio Americano, which lost to Casa Roble and Jesuit to start the season, has a two-game winning streak heading into Friday's game at Calaveras, and then a bye week.""If we can go 3-2 in nonleague, it gives us a shot (at the playoffs),"" Mahaffey said."\u000a

V"Marc Hicks requires a cane and a bit of patience.It takes a moment to slide into a seat, to navigate stairs, to board a team bus.This isn't the Marc Hicks who was a 6-foot-2, 205-pound tailback for Davis High School in 1984, and a specimen described by his coach, Dave Whitmire, as ""almost not human.""The Marc Hicks image that remains is that of the most heavily recruited prospect in Yolo County history, projected by Joe Paterno as a Heisman Trophy winner. Hicks went to Cal and rushed for 113 yards and two touchdowns as a freshman in a 1985 game to help topple USC. And then he faded just as fast as he once burst into the end zone.""I'm still here,"" Hicks said with a laugh while having lunch in Davis on Thursday.This is the Marc Hicks who endures. The smile and good cheer mask the pain of a body slowly failing him. A neurological disease called sarcoidosis is working on the base of his spine and affects his legs and vision. But Hicks keeps moving. He calls himself a ""giver."" He is the Davis Joint Unified School District's top security and community relations officer and assistant head football coach at Davis High.To scores of teenagers he has mentored through the years, Hicks offers a cautionary tale of a shooting star that crashes when academics are neglected. Most aren't star football players, Hicks reminds, so be a star student.Hicks left Cal following the 1986 season, emotionally sapped from mounting academic woes and buckling under the pressure to be the savior of a 2-9 team. Hicks finished his college career at Ohio State but never rediscovered the success he had early at Cal. At 22, he was finished with football.Today, Ohio State hosts Cal. Hicks won't watch the game. He'll be leading Davis to Rio Americano High for a nonleague game. Tonight, he'll be inducted into the Davis Hall of Fame. Hicks was a can't-miss prospect who missed, but his legacy is more of a man who improved a lot of young lives, his friends and peers say.""He's helped hundreds of kids,"" said Davis Enterprise columnist Bob Dunning, who will introduce Hicks and also will be enshrined into the Hall. ""Marc Hicks is a great human being. Things don't always work out the way we think they will, but (tonight) a standing ovation for Marc is assured.""Hicks said he has the same sort of father-son relationship with his son, Davis High wide receiver C.K. Hicks, as he did with his father. Lawrence Hicks died of a stroke when Hicks was 14, a loss he feels even now. C.K., a junior, sports a 3.7 grade-point average.""Oh, I've been on him,"" Hicks said. ""That's where I missed my dad. Still the most devastating thing I've gone through. Had Dad seen me struggle academically, he would have destroyed me.""Hicks paused and added, ""They say it takes a village to raise a child. Well, Davis was my village. I can look back and wonder what if, but I won't. Life is not fair. Lost my dad too early. Look at my broken body. But you deal with it, grow from it, enjoy what you do have, and keep fighting, keep going."""\u000a

V"Bernie Church does not want to waste anyone's time.He's tempted to tell people at McClatchy High School's baseball field today to go home and work on the yard.Church will be the man of the hour when the field into which he poured his life for most of two decades is dedicated in his honor.The 11 a.m. ceremony will include his nine siblings; 94-year-old mother, Mary (his father, James, died in 2006 at 99); wife, Jody; scores of alumni; and former McClatchy coaching friends such as Mike Nishio, Harvey Tahara and Bob Sandoval.Dion James, a 1980 first-round pick out of McClatchy who played 11 major league seasons, also will be there. So will James' son, Jared, a senior on the Lions.""I'm very humbled, that's for sure,"" Church said this week. ""I don't want people to know about this dedication. Just sneak in and get it done. I was just a coach.""He was much more than that, his former players say. Church cast quite an image as McClatchy's baseball coach from 1973 to 1988 and physical education chairman until his retirement in 2004. Mike De Necochea, McClatchy's current baseball coach, played for Church in the 1980s and said his mentor was ""larger than life.""McClatchy athletic administrator Rob Feickert said the field dedication ""just makes sense. Bernie was all about life lessons. He'll be roasted, and we'll see if he cries.""Church couldn't begin to tell you how many league championships or playoff teams he coached. His teams were competitive, and they won their share, the old coach says.Delivering larger messages to teenagers is what mattered to Church. Be accountable. Represent your school positively. Become better men than baseball players.""I don't look back and think about players who signed (pro contracts and scholarships) or who played in college,"" Church said. ""My philosophy was, did baseball help our players become better sons, brothers, husbands, fathers? If so, they were successful.""Over the years, I got calls from a lot of them to be in their wedding, come to a reunion party, go golfing, and I'm so happy for them.""Church coached in the golden era of the Metro League, when Sacramento City Unified School District athletic programs were not on life support, as many are now. In baseball, Church went up against coaches such as Guy Anderson (Cordova), Don Naninni and Don Moak (Kennedy), Don Graf (Sacramento), Mike Inchausti (Burbank) and Ron Limeberger (Christian Brothers).The Metro fielded the area's best players, top teams and most colorful coaches. In the 1980s, Church endured the dynamic teams of Cordova and CBS and Sac High's speedy baserunner Kevin Johnson, now the city's mayor.Church winces at how athletic programs at city schools are struggling, including dilapidated fields filled with gopher holes and weeds. Johnson High's baseball program folded this season because of a shortage of players.Church shares the same concern as other coaches  active and retired  that budget cutbacks threaten to wipe out high school sports.""I really hope athletics don't get cut,"" Church said. ""So many inner-city kids have only one parent at home. They need role models. They need something positive. It's a really sad situation. Coaches have been trying to Band-Aid things for years. The general population doesn't know how tough it is on these coaches.""Church's day won't end after the field dedication. He also will be recognized at the La Salle Club Hall of Fame tonight at CBS. He was a member of the 1962 Bishop Armstrong (later Christian Brothers) baseball team that went 22-2, losing only to Lodi and Stanford's freshman team, and landed a record six players on The Bee's All-City team under coach Dick Sperbeck.""Baseball, teaching and coaching,"" Church said, ""gave me a lot of great memories."""\u000a

V"Three girls records were set and one boys record tied, and the Granite Bay boys won one of the most competitive team title battles in Sac-Joaquin Section Swim Championship history Saturday in Lodi.The highlights: The Rio Americano girls set section records in winning the 200-yard freestyle (1 minute, 35.94 seconds) and 400 free (3:28.44) relays, breaking the marks set by Davis of 1:36.71 in 1995 and 3:28.56 in 2011, respectively. The records were nice farewell presents for retiring Raiders coach Chris Nissen. Granite Bay's Sophie Weber lowered her section record in winning the 200 individual medley in 2:00.50. She bettered a 14-year-old record last season in swimming the 200 IM in 2:01.15. Davis' Matt Whittle, in winning the 100 breaststroke, tied the boys record of 55.74 set by former Blue Devil Keenan Newman in 2002. Granite Bay edged Jesuit 245-243 to win its third boys championship in four years. Davis scored 234 points and Del Oro 229 in what meet director Brent Bohlender called one of the closest team battles he has seen in more than 30 years. Davis won its first girls team title since 2006, finishing with 307 points. Rio Americano (291) was second and Granite Bay (225) third.

V"Ron Gully wonders about details, team emotions and matchups like any basketball leader. He's a coach. It's in his blood to fret this time of year.The Christian Brothers High School girls mentor explained before Tuesday night's tipoff at Cosumnes River College that nerves might unsettle some of his young players, and he wondered how they would collectively respond.Fear not, coach. The Falcons continue to soar.Using pressure defense, balanced scoring and playing hard yet composed, CBS filled the role of top seed with an 82-43 rout of No. 4 Placer in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division III semifinal.CBS (23-7) used a 19-0 run to close out the half in overwhelming the Hillgals (25-5) to reach Friday's title game at Sleep Train Arena against No. 2 Vanden. Elena Daniels led Placer with 12 points.Gully's initial concerns were justified, given that he regularly plays five freshmen and upsets happen at this time of season.Senior guard Niel Valmores led 11 Falcons scorers with 20. Junior guard Alicia Gonzalez had 15 and senior guard Ana Burch 13. Freshman guard Dominique McNeely had nine for CBS, which has won 11 consecutive games and 16 of 17. CBS won its other section girls basketball title in 2008, in Division IV, Gully's first season.""We're peaking at the right time, playing really well,"" Gully said.Gully is in his sixth varsity season as head coach. The retired police officer said he was asked what he would do when his daughter Alexis was finished as a CBS player four years ago. She is now a San Jose State senior and coaches a boys basketball team in her spare time.""I told them that I'd still be right here because I love this school, and I'm blessed to coach this group,"" Gully said.All section semifinalists in Divisions I-V advance to the NorCal Regionals that start next week.No. 2 Vanden 66, No. 6 Modesto Christian 50  Mariah Williams had 15 points and Alex Bader 12 on four three-pointers for the Vikings, who took control with a 16-0 third-quarter run.

V"There appears to be plenty of parity among area softball teams this season.Fifteen teams in The Bee's first Top 20 rankings last week have suffered at least one loss since.Among them was then-nationally ranked and Bee top-ranked Woodcreek, which lost 7-0 to then-No. 12 Roseville last Wednesday. Woodcreek had allowed only three runs through its first nine games.The next day, Roseville beat then-No. 5 Del Oro and its ace Jordan Courage 12-3. Del Oro is the defending Sierra Foothill League champion.Roseville coach Jennifer Birch's young team  three of the 12 players are seniors  hammered out 26 hits against two of the section's top teams.But proving Roseville isn't invincible, either  and that the Sierra Foothill League is top-to-bottom dangerous  unranked Rocklin (5-7-1) and pitcher Maddie Wuelfing defeated the Tigers 5-1 on Monday.Expect more SFL fireworks Thursday as Roseville plays host to Woodcreek at 4 p.m., weather permitting.Roseville is hitting .379, with sophomore Taylor Brewster-McDowell (.545, 10 RBIs) and Saint Mary's signee Lollie Fitzpatrick (.452, 16 RBIs) leading the way.Woodcreek's top slugger is senior shortstop Paige Davis (.500, nine RBIs).Memorial tourney set  Woodcreek and Roseville both are in this weekend's Stephanie LeDoux Memorial Spring Break Tournament at Maidu Park in Roseville, but on opposite brackets.Last year, Roseville defeated Woodcreek 1-0 in the championship game.Six other teams ranked by The Bee  No. 5 Casa Roble, No. 6 Center, No. 9 Del Campo, No. 14 Ponderosa, No. 16 Granite Bay and No. 18 Vista del Lago  are entered in the 15-team tournament.The tournament is played in memory of LeDoux, a starting middle infielder for Roseville's 1990 Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship team and arguably the best in area history.Delta River showdown  Second-ranked Sheldon is scheduled to play at No. 3 St. Francis on Friday in an early Delta River League showdown.Last Friday, Sheldon opened league play with a 12-4 win over Oak Ridge. Arizona State-bound pitcher Alexis Cooper led the way for the Huskies with a home run, three hits, four RBIs and a complete-game win.St. Francis beat Folsom 10-0 in a five-inning mercy-rule victory. Stephanie Heyward tossed a no-hitter. Bailey O'Mara homered and had four RBIs.Both St. Francis and Sheldon will play in next week's Michelle Carew Classic in Southern California's Anaheim Hills.Paris in the spring  Junior pitcher Paris Hallums is a good reason to keep an eye on Ponderosa.Hallums struck out seven and pitched a two-hitter in beating then-No. 6 Pleasant Grove 6-0 in the Delta River League opener last Friday.Hallums is 3-0 with an ERA of 0.00 and has allowed 10 hits in 21 innings for the 4-4 Bruins.Fast start  Defending Golden Empire League champion Marysville is 8-0 behind senior pitcher Ashten Welch (8-0, 2.02 ERA) and junior infielder Tressa Arostegui (.560, 12 RBIs).The Indians play at Capital Christian today in a GEL game, weather permitting."\u000a

V"Nothing changes so fast as the nightclub scene. Open and hot one week, cold and closed the next. In northern Nevada casinos, nightclubs were largely unheard of during the peak showroom years. It was two shows a night with a star, and then retire to a mere bar. The era of ultra lounges seems to have come and gone, those places where a $1,000 bottle of vodka and a $10 short-rib seemed money well spent. Now, it's full-throttle nightclubs with flashing lights, pulsing music and occasional ""stars"" who do little outside of being paid to show up.But two hotels on Lake Tahoe's South Shore hotels have upped the nightclub ante. Harrah's has taken Vex and transformed it into Peek, and the MontBleu has taken its Blu Nightclub and converted it on Saturdays into Boogie Nights.Peek has its grand opening this weekend, commencing tonight with ""Jersey Shore"" personality Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley. San Francisco DJ E Rock also is to appear.Saturday finds Paris Hilton hosting, along with BeatClan, and Sacramento's DJ SN1 spinning. Record producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri will be the celebrity DJ on Sunday.Peek has more than $1 million in upgrades and remodels from Vex. It occupies the same space as the South Shore Room which, on show nights, is converted from theater to nightclub in a matter of hours. It now boasts more than 6,700 square feet of club space, including 40 intimate VIP sections. (Here comes the bottle price!) Aerial shows several stories above the dance floor also are part of the fun. Peek will normally be open Friday and Saturday nights, with cover charges to be determined. (Make booth reservations at peeknightclub.com.)Meanwhile, Blu goes retro with what is billed as ""the ultimate '70s and '80s dance party, ""Boogie Nights,"" a theme party created by Dave Pena and featuring bell bottoms, miniskirts, polyester, Afros and enough crushed velvet to smother John Travolta. Disco balls, of course, funky furniture, shag carpeting and a new 400-foot $30,000 light-up dance floor are featured, along with VIP areas with themes  ""Love Shack"" with a neon pulsating heart or ""Swingers Lounge"" with celebrity impersonators.

V"Ken Kenobbie has a talented, fun-loving softball team at Casa Roble.The first-year coach just wishes he could enjoy the exploits of the No. 6 Rams a little more.Kenobbie, Casa's junior varsity coach last season before stepping up to varsity assistant this season, suddenly was thrust into the top job when coach Kristen Allen resigned to relocate to the Bay Area.Allen's Rams won the Sac-Joaquin Section Division III title in 2010, then moved up to win the D-II section banner in 2011.""It's a lot of pressure,"" Kenobbie said. ""All the parents are looking for a third in a row. The players are staying loose, and they're trying to teach me to stay loose. I tend to get a little tense.""The players didn't give their coach much chance to relax during their past two Capital Valley Conference games.The Rams needed Ali Aguilar's walk-off double in the bottom of the seventh to beat current No. 7 Del Campo 10-9 on April 10 after the Cougars had scored six times in the top of the seventh to tie the score.Then on Monday, Casa Roble held off unranked Bella Vista 1-0 behind Kaitlyn Garcia's one-hitter and her run-scoring triple in the fourth inning.""Our league is really competitive, and if we are fortunate to make the playoffs, Division II is loaded with good teams,"" Kenobbie said.Casa Roble has the talent and experience to make a run at a section three-peat.Aguilar, a junior shortstop, and Krystal Aubert (.526, 18 RBIs), a sophomore third baseman, already have verbally committed to Washington after being selected as conference Players of the Year, respectively, their freshman seasons.Senior second baseman Kasie Trezona is a four-year starter; senior center fielder Aleena Willard leads the outfield; and Kenobbie's daughter, McKenzie, has been steady at catcher.But the key is Garcia (10-3, 2.78 ERA), a junior and the Rams' only listed pitcher. She has pitched every inning for Casa Roble for the past two seasons. She's been challenged  giving up 16 hits against Del Campo  and dominating  stifling Bella Vista.""Kaitlyn is a workhorse who is mentally tough,"" Kenobbie said.

V"The Partridge family has been a productive one of endless proportions for the Granite Bay Grizzlies over the years.Four brothers, a lot of leadership, a host of victories and scores of memories.The last of the lot is Taft Partridge, a hard-charging senior fullback whose two second-half touchdown runs  yes, the burly back can motor  keyed Granite Bay's 35-23 triumph over Oak Ridge on Friday night at Sacramento State.The Grizzlies retained their Division I championship in relative dry conditions after a day of battering wind and rain at Sac State with tremendous offensive-line play that served to unleash three runners. And the defense did just enough to hold off a determined Trojans bunch that kept in it in the second half behind savvy quarterback Jason Samuels (314 yards, two touchdowns).Partridge isn't the fastest of the Granite Bay backfield crew by any means, but he was in downhill mode on his last few carries, tearing off untouched scoring runs of 47 yards and 86 yards for a program that has five section crowns since 1999 under coach Ernie Cooper, who brought the fly-sweep offense from Aptos High in Santa Cruz County and ignited a dynasty of sorts.Also a fine blocker, Partridge ran for 235 yards on just 11 carries for a hefty 21.4-yard average. John Cooley went for 126 yards on 21 tries, opening the scoring with a five-yard touchdown run, and Tony Ellison had 194 on 15, including a seven-yard score for a 21-9 lead.All told, the Grizzlies (11-3) battered a sound Trojans (12-2) defense for 549 rushing yards and 606 total as Grant Caraway contributed a nine-yard touchdown pass to Steven Graber for a 14-3 first-quarter lead.""Feels great,"" Partridge said. ""Back to back championships. So happy.""The other Partridge brothers are Will, a fullback in 2004; Judd, a defensive end in 2006; and Clark, a fullback in 2007 and 2008. Taft is a three-year starter with a bit of family bragging rights to the tune of two titles and a chance to play in a NorCal Regional game next week, either the Open or the D-I contest.Granite Bay eliminated an Oak Ridge team that had lost only to D-II top-seed Folsom. The Grizzlies have won 10 consecutive games, not at all resembling an outfit as green as their school colors that staggered to a 1-3 start in facing brutal early competition.""Early on, when we got off to that start, I wondered if we still had it here at Granite Bay,"" Cooper said this week. ""We're sitting at 1-3 and we're thinking, what's going on here? We decided to go back to basics. We used to block well. We used to tackle well, and we went back to what worked before. So what if teams know what plays we're going to run? We've done it for 16, 17 years. It's dinosaur football, so who's fooling who, but dinosaur works.""Said Oak Ridge coach Eric Cavaliere of the Grizzlies: ""What a great program. They have the best defense of any team we've seen all year."""\u000a

V"Sometimes, a figurative kick to the face mask can serve a team a ton of good.The Oak Ridge High School football team can raise its collective helmets in agreement that the manner in which it has responded to its lone loss this season has defined this group.Since falling to now 13-0 Folsom by four touchdowns on Oct. 5 in a Delta River League opener, Oak Ridge has peeled off seven consecutive victories, none more emphatic and meaningful than the 24-6 thumping it laid on previously unbeaten Burbank on Saturday in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division I semifinal on Florin Road.""That was the turning point for us,"" said Trojans quarterback Jason Samuels, who led yet another balanced attack with two first-half touchdowns. ""We never want to feel that again, losing. We know what it feels like to lose, how to get better. It helped us.""Oak Ridge (12-1) dominated the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, the first time anyone can lay that claim against the Titans, who stormed to a school-record 12-0 start with speed and physicality.Zach Claiborne, who anchors the defensive line, had five of the Trojans' eight sacks. Burbank's three 1,000-yard rushers were held in check for the first time this season, with little room to run and no clear path to the end zone.The Titans managed 21 rushing yards when factoring in the sacks.Now it's on to Friday's D-I final against defending champion Granite Bay at Sacramento State, where more strong line play is in order to maintain the momentum.""Amazing job by the lines,"" Oak Ridge coach Eric Cavaliere beamed.The Trojans' offensive line of Cory Gregerson, Jacob Proul, Kareem Ballal and brothers Jason and Hekoti Chapman allowed Samuels to remain upright. The Titans came in with a remarkable 88 sacks, including a state-leading 22 1/2 by defensive tackle Ngaly Tapa.The Titans had none on Saturday, allowing Samuels to coolly hit Ross Dwelley for a five-yard touchdown strike and Byron Spain for a 25-yard score to highlight a 17-0 second quarter. The barrage was capped by a 26-yard Ryan Lamb field goal.Blake Martin's six-yard touchdown run in the third quarter made it 24-0, and the defense allowed only a 39-yard touchdown pass from Ernest Jenkins to Calvin Green with 5:17 left in the third.Samuels passed for 158 yards, and Martin ran for 58, Josh Wellman for 67 and Tanner Hughes 54 for the Trojans.Oak Ridge's balanced attack will now challenge the formidable defense of Granite Bay, fresh off a 37-7 rout of top-seeded and previously 12-0 Franklin in the other semifinal on Friday night.""The line play, that's all the dinners we've treated the linemen to,"" a grinning Samuels said of the family tradition to feed the hogs in the trenches. ""We have a great offensive line and can pass and run.""Claiborne is joined on the Trojans' defensive front by Proul, Chandler Christy and Elijah English. Unassuming out of pads at 6 feet and 190 pounds, Claiborne leads the state with 25 1/2 sacks. Not bad for a fellow who battled the flu and a sore knee this week.""He's a great player,"" Proul said. ""It's our Oak Ridge wall, and it's hard to bring down. Oak Ridge and Granite Bay, there's no better way to go.""More motivation for Oak Ridge: Granite Bay eliminated the Trojans from the playoffs last season, 21-12."\u000a

V"Roseville City School District officials will hold back-to-back information sessions tonight and Wednesday as Warren T. Eich Intermediate School prepares for a metamorphosis.The plan is for Eich to absorb part of the adjoining Sierra Gardens Elementary School campus and expand to include sixth-grade students.That means students in grades kindergarten through fifth grade at Sierra Gardens Elementary School will be dispersed to other campuses.The more ambitious agenda item is to adopt the rigorous International Baccalaureate academic program for the new sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade campus. ""The reaction so far has been excitement,"" said Marc Buljan, Eich's principal. While district enrollment is growing overall, schools such as Eich in the older, established side of town have seen declining enrollment, officials said. Eich opened in 1964.The hope is that the challenging academic program will cause more parents to keep their kids in the neighborhood school and even attract new interest. The information sessions are scheduled for 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the school gymnasium, 1509 Sierra Gardens Drive. Tonight's session is aimed at parents of Crestmont and Stoneridge elementary school students, while Wednesday's session is open to all.The decision to close Sierra Gardens was made in 2012 and was less controversial than recent deliberations by the Sacramento City Unified School District, officials said.The baccalaureate program requires teachers to undergo additional training and involves a two- to three- year application process.Adding sixth-grade students, effective with the new school year, will increase the enrollment to 725 next year, up from from 540. The transition to the baccalaureate curriculum will start right away but will take time, Buljan said.""Next year, all sixth-graders will be taking Spanish,"" he said. The program also beefs up the school's arts offerings, another facet popular with parents, Buljan said.The baccalaureate program is forcing administrators to find time for the additional offerings without sacrificing core curriculum, Buljan said. Next year, the normal school day will shift from six to seven class periods.The key, he said, is to make better use of time. Current research suggests kids of middle school years have a 15- to 18-minute window of attention before they start to tune out, he said.Buljan said by capitalizing on that knowledge and cutting down on repetition, teachers can actually do more with less time.The other major change will be creating lessons that integrate multiple disciplines such as math, science and physical education.For instance a science class teaches about the heart, a math class teaches how to graph data, and then in P.E. students run the laps to create the data set.""You are actually gonna go run those laps,"" Buljan said.The overall goal of the baccalaureate program is to encourage students to be creative, whole-brained problem-solvers.""We are not just focusing on left-brain thinking. We are also putting a big focus on the right-brain thinking,"" Buljan said. ""That is what companies are looking for when they are hiring."""\u000a

V"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.  Baseball was invented in the United States, but the World Baseball Classic has been dominated by Japan.U.S. manager Joe Torre has taken a different approach in the WBC's third edition this year. Rather than stock his roster with stars, he has a basic starting nine with utility players, three catchers and 15 pitchers filling out the 28-man group. ""I think it's advantageous. I think you need role players,"" said Milwaukee outfielder Ryan Braun, who was part of the 2009 team that reached the semifinals. ""You look at regular teams throughout the course of the season, those role players are instrumental in teams finding a way to win games. It's certainly important to have versatility.""The Americans will play exhibition games against the White Sox and Rockies before opening against Mexico on Friday at Chase Field in Phoenix. The game could draw an enthusiastic and not necessarily pro-U.S. crowd. Although the team includes Braun, Mets third baseman David Wright and Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, Torre chose only one player at each infield position.Philadelphia's Jimmy Rollins is at shortstop, and Cincinnati's Brandon Phillips will play second. Minnesota catcher Joe Mauer expected to fill in at first base as well as a designated hitter. The outfielders are Braun, Baltimore's Adam Jones and Miami's Giancarlo Stanton.J.P. Arencibia will catch his Toronto teammate, knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, in the opener.The Americans' group also includes Canada and Italy. After round-robin play concludes with the Canada-U.S. game on Sunday, the top two nations advance to the second round in Florida. The semifinals and final will be held March 17-19 at AT Park.Notes  Reds first baseman Joey Votto, who had surgery for torn knee cartilage last season, will play for Canada.  In Fukuoka, Japan, Jose Abreu hit a grand slam to help Cuba clobber China 12-0 and ensure it would advance to the second round. In Taipei, Taiwan, Seung Song allowed two hits in four innings, and South Korea beat Australia 6-0 in Group B."\u000a

V"PHOENIX  A's infielder Scott Sizemore received good news Monday when an X-ray of his left hand showed no broken bones.Sizemore was hit by a pitch on the back of the hand Sunday and left the game after he had trouble gripping a bat.Sizemore said he probably won't play the next two days while he tries to ""get that swelling and inflammation out of "" the hand. He wore a protective wrap Monday but said the pain wasn't too bad.The prognosis came as a relief to Sizemore, who missed the 2012 season after injuring his knee on the first day of spring training workouts.Sizemore singled in his first two at-bats Sunday to bring his average this spring to .250 (3 for 12).""Extremely relieved,"" he said. ""Definitely don't need any broken bones or serious injuries at this point.""Balfour update  Right-handed closer Grant Balfour threw 35 to 40 pitches Monday in his second session off a mound since Feb. 14 arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.""My knee feels fine,"" Balfour said. ""Now it's just getting the ball to pop out of my hand. I'm not even thinking about my knee so much. Just thinking about pitches.""Balfour is still limited moving the knee while waiting for cuts from the surgery to heal completely. He said he plans to throw another bullpen session Wednesday but has no timetable for facing hitters.Straily's day  Melvin affirmed before the A's 13-5 win over the Angels on Monday that right-hander Dan Straily is competing for a roster spot this spring. Straily gave up two runs and four hits in 2 1/3 innings in his second spring outing and said his fastball command was encouraging but rued a curveball that was hit for a double.""That's a pitch I wouldn't normally throw in that situation but something I'm working on,"" Straily said. ""It might be time to forget about trying stuff out and just try to work on what I have.""Straily limited the damage in the first inning after the first three Angels reached base. Following Howie Kendrick's RBI single, Straily retired the next three hitters on a fielder's choice, strikeout and comeback grounder.""I thought he pitched better than the numbers,"" Melvin said.Et cetera  Catcher John Jaso's bases-clearing triple erased a 2-0 Angels lead in the fourth, but Oakland scored most of its runs Monday after the starters left. Center fielder Shane Peterson had an RBI triple and is 10 for 23 (.435) this spring with seven extra-base hits.""He's making as big an impression as anybody here in camp,"" Melvin said. Reliever Sean Doolittle made his second spring appearance, striking out the side in one inning of work. Yoenis Cespedes singled in the fourth inning after an 0-for-12 start in spring training.

V"Judith Lowry's vibrant paintings tell the story of her California Indian roots. Ranging from images based on her family history to oral legends inspired by her Pit River, Maidu and Washoe heritage, they represent her reflections on Native California. Up at the Pence Gallery in Davis, ""Our Stories"" encompasses works from nearly two decades of the artist's career. The bulk of the show, selected by guest curator Karah English, comprises recent works that illustrate myths and stories told to Lowry by her father, Leonard Lowry, an American Indian who was a decorated hero in World War II. Leonard appears in the earliest painting in the show, ""Beautiful Dreamers,"" which depicts Lowry's father with his then-girlfriend and another Indian couple at a bar on New Year's Eve, 1945. According to English, at a time when alcohol sales were forbidden to Indians in many places, the portrait represents a moment of resistance when Leonard and his friends refused to be treated as second-class citizens. In this compelling painting, Lowry reflects her mixed cultural heritage (her mother was Australian) and her experiences as an Army brat growing up in places where she was able to see European Old Master paintings. Symbolizing the deleterious effects of alcohol on Indian culture, small European-style cherubs set fire to the scene. This work is her masterpiece. Also masterful is ""Obedient Wives,"" a fiery image that depicts a scene in the legend that explains how the rat lost his hairy tail. Here Rat's wives, witchy owl-like creatures, surround their husband as he roasts in flames after losing a wrestling match with Weasel. It's a dramatic and bewitching image. Moving forward in time, ""He Glitters When We Walk"" is an homage to the late Harry Fonseca, a much beloved Indian artist from Sacramento who won fame in Santa Fe, N.M., a strong center for Indian artists from all over the country. Here Lowry depicts Fonseca, who died in 2006 at the age of 50, with a golden halo. He wears a fine overcoat but his pants legs are rolled up as he stands in a pool of cleansing water as if deified by his passing to a more spiritual realm.Most of Lowry's newer paintings are done in blue and white on a black background, the colors symbolizing a spiritual state. In the series ""Weh Pom (Coyote) and the Star Sisters,"" she illustrates a story about the trickster god Coyote who tries to seduce the beautiful and chaste Star Sisters, who punish him by making him dance endlessly in the sky. Coyote, at the center, threatens to fly apart, as the beautiful sisters in California Indian regalia surround him.In the same palette, she gives us smaller images of indigenous men and women with tribal tattoos on their faces. They range from an old and wizened woman to a beautiful young woman with a feather headdress and a necklace of beads and abalone shell. ""Cry Song,"" a triptych painted on ironing boards, represents a ceremonial song used to lessen the pain of losing loved ones. A male and female figure, with skeletal bones, flank a fiery spirit in the center who is split by a lightning bolt. The piece, notes English, honors all ancestors, male and female and the spirit of interdependence. A group of small paintings from Lowry's illustrated children's book written by Chiori Santiago, ""Home to Medicine Mountain,"" tell the story of Lowry's father and uncle, who were separated from their family and culture in an Indian boarding school. Here the boys escape their confinement and return home to see their family and attend the annual Bear Dance. English provides wall text that explains the cruelties Indian children endured in these schools. On display along with Lowry's paintings are examples of Indian basketry from the California Indian Heritage Center. There are two magnificent burden baskets, used to gather food and medicine, and several basket caps, which Hupa, Yurok and Karok Indians wore as part of their women's dance regalia. A picture of women participating in a Flower Dance demonstration at a DQ University powwow in April 2012 demonstrates that basket caps are still worn today as a source of pride by Native California women and that cultural traditions continue to be observed.OUR STORIESWhat: Judith Lowry's artistic reflections on Native CaliforniaWhere: Pence Gallery, 212 D St., DavisWhen: 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday.

V"Fans of high school girls volleyball got a treat Saturday in El Dorado Hills.Oak Ridge hosted the Chris Craft Memorial tournament, which has become the early-season who's who of the region's top teams and players.And this one didn't disappoint.Oak Ridge coach Becky Potter and her staff hosted 13 of The Bee's Top 20 teams among the 24-team fields.""It's been a big tournament for us,"" Potter said. ""I'm proud of the 24 teams here; it was a great turnout. We have gotten to the point now where we have to start turning teams away.""The talent was strong, too, with players like Utah verbal commit Caroline Sipiora from Vista del Lago, Granite Bay setter Taylor Nelson and outside hitter Maddy Deters and Davis senior Lyndsay Chambers.Potter said getting this many top teams together in September gives players and coaches a chance to face the best and evaluate their squads before league play begins later this month. ""We get to see the teams we will play at sections and then realize we will be a totally different team in two months,"" Potter said.Bella Vista coach Troy Songer agrees that getting such a huge talent pool under one roof this early is best for everyone.""It's the great thing about this tournament,"" Songer said. ""You've got so many of the top teams, and you get to see how you stack up and what you need to work on.""El Camino beat Granite Bay 2-0 to win the tournament for the second year in a row. ""It feels awesome,"" Eagles coach Marty Soyama said. ""We watched this team grow up right here throughout the day.""Nevada Union made a great run into the semifinals with an extended match against fellow Sierra Foothill League member Del Oro in the opening round of the final bracket. The Miners, led by outside hitters Sierra Payne and Emily Segel, then defeated a higher-seeded Christian Brothers squad in the quarterfinals.After going a disappointing 20-21 last season, Del Oro gave SFL favorite and No. 3 Granite Bay all it could handle in the semifinals. The SFL again will be one of the strongest leagues and possibly the deepest in the Sac-Joaquin Section this season. All six teams in the league are ranked in The Bee's Top 20.Sauna conditioning  Some teams work out in gyms with air conditioning to escape the summer heat.Some coaches in the San Juan Unified School District say their girls might be the best conditioned in the section because they have been sweating all summer.""It's been tough, but we have just gotten used to it,"" said Bella Vista's Songer. ""Been like this since I've been here.""Songer said he had a chance to get a new donated air conditioner for the older gym at Bella Vista, but the district couldn't approve it because the future upkeep would cost too much.El Camino has a new AC unit being installed, and it should be ready by November or, as assistant coach Curtis Gee joked, ""just the right time for air conditioning.""Granite Bay cheers  Despite a loss in the Chris Craft final, Granite Bay coach Jaime Ingram was one of the happiest people in the gym. Ingram's husband, Aaron, is Sacramento State's running backs coach. After the Hornets beat Colorado on a field goal as time expired Saturday, Ingram couldn't hold back her excitement.""I had to ask someone to hold my phone because if the field goal wasn't good, I was going to toss it,"" Ingram joked between matches.

""It's by far the most memorable game I've played in.""But at the time, all I could think about was how tired I was. I kept telling my teammates, 'Let's not let this go into overtime because I don't know if I can make it.' ""Not only did the game go into overtime, it took two overtimes for Kennedy to beat the Trojans 62-58.Johnson tied the score 54-54 with a buzzer-beating putback to force the second overtime. Then the 5-foot-10 guard-forward's three-pointer with 1:05 to go gave Kennedy the lead for good at 60-58. She finished with 24 points and nine rebounds.Jenn Hoffman, then an unsung Oak Ridge sophomore, matched Johnson with 24 points, including six three-pointers. Her two free throws with 5.1 seconds left sent the game into the first overtime 49-49.""Whenever you get a chance to win a championship, it's a special experience, even if losing leaves a bad taste in your mouth,"" Oak Ridge coach Steve White said. ""What I remember most is that we were a half-second from victory and Lynette gets an offensive rebound and putback. I also remember how amazing it was watching Jenn try to will her team to victory.""The teams meet again at 7:30 tonight in another high-stakes game, the D-I semifinals at Pacific.Many of those who played in last season's championship game are back, including the do-everything Johnson  she's eight points shy of 200 career playoff points  and the 5-4 Hoffman, still a dangerous outside scoring threat.It's a matchup of two of the area's top girls programs and two longtime coaches, White and Kennedy's Dave Parsh, who got to know each other while commuting to master's degree classes at Saint Mary's more than a decade ago.""That was back when I was considering pursuing a college coaching job,"" said Parsh, who has taught at Kennedy since 2000 and has been the girls head coach for four seasons. ""That was before I decided family life took precedence, that I couldn't go around the country traveling and living that kind of lifestyle.""White's Oak Ridge teams have made the playoffs all 18 seasons he has coached at the El Dorado Hills school. His teams have won three section titles, and his 2010 team, led by Stanford's Sara James, upset nationally ranked Long Beach Poly for the CIF state championship.Parsh also has won three section titles  two at St. Francis and last year at Kennedy  and coached a state championship team 20 years ago at St. Francis.Both coaches say they are fortunate to work at schools with strong traditions and support staffs and smart and fundamentally sound players. And they often win without a plethora of players who go on to play at Division I colleges.Johnson (Utah State) and Oak Ridge senior forward Haley Anderson (UC San Diego) are the only players from this season's teams who have signed NCAA letters of intent.Oak Ridge has had eight consecutive 20-plus-win seasons, including 25-3 this year. The Trojans' only losses have been to national No. 1 Mater Dei of Santa Ana, national No. 6 Pflugerville of Texas and Bay Area power Heritage of Brentwood.Kennedy, which has had six 20-plus-win seasons in the last eight years, is 23-5. The Cougars have lost to Division II section semifinalist Sacramento twice and NorCal powers St. Mary's of Stockton (top-seeded and opposite Oak Ridge and Kennedy in the D-I bracket) and Salesian of Richmond.The Cougars also lost 55-50 to D-III finalist Christian Brothers in the Oak Ridge tournament in December, preventing an anticipated Kennedy-Oak Ridge championship finale.That loss has made tonight's game even more intriguing.Oak Ridge is led by Anderson, who had 23 points in the Trojans' 52-37 quarterfinal win over Monterey Trail, and Ali Bettencourt, a 5-10 junior guard who had 22 points in a 68-29 win over Bella Vista in the playoffs opener.""It's going to be a tough game,"" Johnson said. ""Steve White is an amazing coach. His teams are always so disciplined and fundamental. And the way they lost last year  it was such a tough loss  I know they want to beat us.""Johnson will get no argument from White.""Lynette is an amazing player, but she also has great support, which makes them so tough,"" White said of Kennedy's team, which includes 6-1 Dalayna Tyler-Scott, Jessica Lauderdale, Katie Lee, Arica Ng and Sidney Owen. ""They can shoot the lights out, they're fundamentally sound and play good defense. You can see Dave's stamp on everything they do.""Johnson, who has suffered three concussions during her prep career, just hopes it's not another double-overtime thriller.""When that was all said and done, the fatigue, the pain, the injuries, it was all worth it,"" Johnson said of last year's game. ""But I'd rather not do that again."""\u000a

We have players who say hello to him during youth games.""Johnson heaped equal praise on Nixon and the Thundering Herd, saying, ""Great coach in Nixon, and they're the best until someone beats them.""The area's best rivalry in recent years has been rooted in Placer County between No. 6 Granite Bay and No. 10 Del Oro. They will meet in Granite Bay as the lone unbeatens in the Sierra Foothill League.Del Oro prevailed in a thriller last fall en route to a Sac-Joaquin Section Division III championship and a state CIF Bowl bid. Granite Bay never looked back from that setback, winning its final six games, including the Division I section title.Del Oro and Granite Bay are coached by Casey Taylor and Ernie Cooper, respectively. The longtime rivals socialized and dined together and rooted for each other during the Southern California phase of the Battle for Veterans earlier this season.""I really respect the guy, and that's why I hang out with him,"" Cooper said of Taylor. ""He's a great coach who does it the right way.""Said Taylor of Cooper: ""People think we might not like each other because we compete so hard and want to beat each other, but Ernie and I are all about family, football, working hard, all in for the same cause  and we're very close friends.""Welcome back  Sidelined for three games with a knee strain, Del Oro tailback Brandon Monroe made an emphatic return on Friday against Roseville. The San Jose State scholarship commit returned the opening kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown, returned an interception 60 yards for a score and rushed for 55 yards in a 24-7 victory.Welcome aboard  Sporting one of the section's best defenses, Whitney returned to The Bee's Top 20 at No. 15, having lost only to rival Rocklin 6-0 in the annual Quarry Bowl on Sept. 7. Also back in the Top 20: Vista del Lago, which lost only its opener to Oak Ridge 42-6 in a game that was 14-6 at the half.More big games  No. 11 Cosumnes Oaks will host No. 20 Vista del Lago for the Sierra Valley Conference title in a meeting of offensive powers. Cosumnes Oaks is balanced with quarterback Alex Kropp and junior wide receiver Alex Van Dyke, a national recruit, and a running game averaging 199 yards a contest. Vista is paced by sophomore passer Matt Jimison and wide receivers Brad Rittenhouse, Chris Cooper and Tyler Kaim. No. 7 Oak Ridge will host Ponderosa in a Delta River League game in El Dorado Hills, with both needing a win to maintain any title hopes in a meeting of top quarterbacks. Oak Ridge is led by Jason Samuels and Ponderosa by Jake Bist. To keep pace with No. 5 Placer in the Pioneer Valley League race, No. 19 Center and 6-1 Bear River can ill afford a loss. Bear River, fresh off a 14-7 loss at Placer, will host the upstart Cougars. Something will have to give in a SVC game between Union Mine and host Galt. Both are 0-7."\u000a

V"On an unusually cool summer day, Timothy Olson, 28, rounded the Placer High School track Saturday night for the first sub-15-hour finish in the history of the Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run.After placing sixth in 2011, Olson came back from Ashland, Ore., with a vengeance this year to shatter Geoff Roes' 2010 course record by more than 20 minutes, finishing in 14 hours, 46 minutes and 44 seconds.Ellie Greenwood, 33, of Canada set the women's record in 16:47:19, besting the previous mark of 17:37:51 set by Ann Trason in 1994.An estimated 380 runners are competing in the race, which began at 5 a.m. Saturday in Squaw Valley. The course will remain open until the 30-hour cutoff at 11 a.m. today.A sea of professional photographers, and iPhone amateurs, captured Olson's celebration as he high-fived fans along the final 60 meters and crossed the finish line under the waving flags of the participating nations.Alongside all the lenses recording Olson's conquering the grueling run, another set of cameras focused on his feet.The high school track in Auburn was one of four spots on the course where Dr. Marty Hoffman set up cameras to capture the competitors' gaits for his study on how different foot-strike patterns may reduce muscular damage in ultra-runners.After crossing the finish line, runners continued moving to the medical tent for final weigh-ins and blood work-ups that help the competitors receive medical attention and provide scientists with relevant data.For researchers, the endurance race over mountains and across rivers  in which participants lose an average of 3 percent of their body weight while competing for 16 to 30 hours  provides a unique opportunity to study the physiological effects of ultra-running.""This environment cannot be re-created in a lab,"" said Hoffman, a member of the Western States Research Committee who ran the race for numerous years before focusing on the studies. ""There is a lot of potential research that can be done at the race.""Over the course of the race the competitors ascended 18,000 feet and descended 23,000 feet in the Sierra, teams of researchers coordinated at medical checkpoints along the course to collect scientific data.The conclusions reached  on everything from dietary practices to limiting muscular damage  will be applied to future Western States events to help the runners enhance athletic performance and to help medical professionals provide care.""Our job isn't over until the runners have the information,"" Hoffman said, adding that each year since the early 1980s the research has been presented on the Thursday before the race at a medical clinic.For researchers, many of whom are able to understand the runners' perspective after winning multiple Western States belt buckles, it is essential that the studies not interfere with the integrity of the race.At the 62-mile Foresthill Elementary School aid station, runners could grab everything from cookies and chicken soup, to nuts and soda before continuing the descent to Placer High.Behind the weigh-in scales sat Dr. Jeff Volek from the University of Connecticut, who waited to take cheek swabs from the runners participating in his study.Volek hopes to better understand how dietary decisions influence the body's inflammatory reaction during ultra-endurance sports by comparing runners with low- and high-carbohydrate diets.The medical research was sidelined about 2:15 p.m. Saturday when Olson was the first competitor to run onto the scales. He jogged past the cheering fans and proceeded down the course without having his cheek swabbed.""He's in the lead,"" Volek said of losing a data point in his study.Concerns over maintaining control over the research and upholding ethical standards led to the establishment of a formal research committee in 2006.Past research has included taking biopsies of runners' muscles after the race and measuring the size of their arteries to understand how exercise changes the body.""We now have funding for research and an internationally recognized committee that reviews the proposals and screens them for their potential likelihood of producing something of value,"" Hoffman said.The studies conducted at Western States provide scientists with a greater understanding of the human body and also changed conventional wisdom, said John Medinger, a trustee on the Western States Board of Directors who publishes UltraRunning magazine.Runners at Western States used to take an abundance of pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, to reduce inflammation, Medinger said.At the Thursday medical clinic at Squaw Valley Lodge, runners listened as Hoffman explained how Western States research has shown that pain relievers can potentially damage kidneys and decrease muscular recovery.Seminal work has been done and continues on hydration practices. Cooler temperatures and rain graced Saturday's race, but it is not unusual for temperatures to soar above 100 degrees.In the 1970s, doctors were primarily concerned with runners' water consumption. Competitors were then encouraged to drink a lot of water before and during the event, Medinger said.""After the first race in 1977, we noticed that there were some spectacular weight drops and the more weight the runner lost, the more likely it was that they would drop out,"" said Dr. Bob Lind, a longtime medical director for Western States.Lind and his team began monitoring runners' weights during the race, and encouraged racers to stay as close to their pre-race weight as possible."\u000a

V"""A Pail of Grace,"" the 17th original holiday play written by Buck Busfield, slyly slips in as a smart comedy with thoughtful underpinnings. But Busfield, who also directs, has spirituality on his mind, and he explores the difficulties of looking for and finding salvation.The modern-day story has real estate mogul John Finuken (a graceful performance by David Silberman) experience a spiritual epiphany while sitting in a park. Having felt the presence of God in everything around him, John decides he must become a vessel of God's word and work only for the Lord.Dave Pierini plays his ne'er-do-well son, Stephanie McVay his sweet but clueless wife and Elisabeth Nunziato his type-A daughter. Kurt Johnson shakes the family up as the wild card Zjelko Krelko, who has some shocking suggestions and deep personal ties to John.The production continues at 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays, 2 and 6:30 p.m. Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Thursday-Fridays, 5 and 9 p.m. Saturdays, and 2 p.m. Sundays, through Dec. 30.

V"Asa Jackson is back in his old bed at his parents' home in Greenhaven, and one perk especially stands out.""I slept in this morning,"" said Jackson, a senior cornerback at Cal Poly who played at Christian Brothers High School. ""It's great to be home for the draft.""For most players, the NFL draft is a time of sleepless nights filled with anxiety. Jackson said he grew up watching the draft unfold on ESPN, tossing a football to his brother Ade, now at Penn, and fantasizing about draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. breaking down his game.Now it's about to become reality: He's expected to be the highest-drafted player with Sacramento ties.""Growing up, friends and I would say that the goal isn't just to play in high school and college, but to play in the NFL, the dream, and now it's here,"" Jackson said. ""After my first year at Cal Poly, I had a feeling I could do this. With all the evaluations, the workouts, to think I went from under-recruited player in high school to potential NFL draft pick is exciting. It's been a whirlwind.""Jackson is a four-time All-Great West Conference pick who started all 45 games for the Division I-AA Mustangs. Considered deceptively strong with good skills and quickness, he impressed at the NFL combine in February, running a 4.4-second 40-yard dash and bench pressing 225 pounds 19 times.That effort earned him a 70.5 grade, which translates into a middle-round pick. ""I've heard everything from the third to sixth round,"" Jackson said. ""I'm happy it's almost here. I have no idea who will draft me or where I'll be. I know my mom (Karen) is anxious, too. We all are.""Jackson had 54 tackles, two interceptions, seven breakups and nine deflections last fall for Cal Poly and was named a Sports Network All-American. He also averaged 25.1 yards on kickoff returns and 14.7 yards on punt returns, so the team that drafts him will get more than just a cover guy.""I can do a lot of things,"" Jackson said. ""I'm not sure how I'll handle watching this draft. Watching it has always been a normal thing, every year, and it's good to be with family. My mom helps keep me low-stressed."""\u000a

V"President Barack Obama will meet with congressional leaders Friday, the day across-the-board spending cuts are scheduled to take place.It will be the first meeting between Obama, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. to speak about the reductions.The meeting Friday is an opportunity for us to visit with the president about how we can all keep our commitment to reduce Washington spending,'' said Don Stewart, a McConnell spokesman. ""With a $16.6 trillion national debt, and a promise to the American people to address it, one thing is perfectly clear: we will cut Washington spending. We can either secure those reductions more intelligently, or we can do it the Presidents way with across-the board cuts. But one thing Americans simply will not accept is another tax increase to replace spending reductions we already agreed to. The reductions  known inside the Beltway as sequestration  stem from a compromise between both parties to raise the nations debt ceiling in 2011. Both sides agreed to the cuts as a last resort to try to motivate themselves to act. It did not work.The first round of reductions  postponed from January  is estimated to be $85 billion. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that agencies will reduce spending by about $44 billion, with the remaining cuts coming in future years."\u000a

V"The issue has filled the local newspaper's editorial pages and both sides have their share of heavyweights in their corners. Add the city's closure this week of a key water well and Davis' contentious water debate continues to simmer just days before its March 5 election for Measure I.Davis voters in the special mail-only election are deciding whether the city moves forward with the estimated $245 million Surface Water Project  the plan to provide Sacramento River water to Davis and Woodland in 2016 to supplement what the cities pull from their aging wells. A yes vote on Measure I gives the city the go-ahead to work with Woodland. A no vote tells Davis leaders to consider other options. Opponents continue to call for more time. They say the city shouldn't be rushed by Woodland's pressing 2016 clean-water deadlines because Davis' deadlines don't arrive until 2020. They say the plan  and the increased water rates the city is calling for to help fund it  are too costly.""The city is really trying to change our water system. This is a humongous thing,"" said Davis attorney and Measure I opponent Michael Harrington. ""We're not talking about moving a stop sign. They have to get it right. The message to voters is if you're not sure about the project and you think it's being rushed, you should vote no.""Opponents want Davis leaders to renew talks with West Sacramento to treat and furnish Davis' water supply or craft a regional water solution with West Sacramento, Woodland and UC Davis, instead of the planned water treatment plant and pipeline at the 17,300-acre Conaway Ranch on the Sacramento River. Harrington said opponents are wary of the motivations behind the proposed project, calling it an expensive pitch to attract new development to the steadfastly slow-growth city. Those who support Measure I include Davis and regional leaders, building trades advocates California Alliance for Jobs and the Plumbers & Pipefitters Local 447.""We think the need for river water is contrived,"" Harrington said. ""Instead of deciding to live within our means, (proponents) want to grab river water. It's completely contrary to the Davis tradition."" The city's decision this week to shut down Well 30, the west side well that produces more than 10 percent of Davis' water supply, left Harrington with more suspicions, calling the closure a ""scare tactic"" to sway voters.Davis water officials recorded high levels of manganese in Well 30 water. At 1,700 parts per billion, the readings far exceeded the maximum 50 parts per billion allowed in drinking water, leading to the well's closure. Readings were even higher in later tests, said principal city engineer Dianna Jensen. She said costs to treat and restart the well could reach $2.6 million.The measure's supporters say delaying a decision is too risky, carrying with it the specter of fast approaching state clean-water deadlines and higher water rates and other costs to replace old and failing water infrastructure.""There's going to be a cost for not doing the project,"" said Elaine Roberts Musser, chairwoman of the city's Water Advisory Committee and a leading proponent of Measure I. She said ratepayers could expect sharp increases in rates to pay for infrastructure.""There's a whole host of costs and problems,"" Musser said. ""You throw good money after bad by putting off the inevitable. The inevitable will cost more later than now."" Meanwhile, officials from the Woodland-Davis Clean Water Agency, the joint powers authority representing Woodland, Davis and the University of California, Davis, continue to press forward.Woodland and Davis city councilmembers earlier this month met with federal agencies and lawmakers to make their bid for millions of dollars in federal funding for the joint water project's estimated $42 million intake facility on the Sacramento River. Whether those meetings have any effect on the outcome is unclear. About 7,000 votes have already been mailed to elections officials.While Harrington was optimistic that the measure will be defeated, Musser was reluctant to speculate on the outcome. ""Now it's up to the citizens,"" Musser said. ""They're the ultimate deciders."""\u000a

V"The West Sacramento campus of WyoTech, which offers career technical training for students aspiring to enter the automotive and construction industries, will close in mid-October.Kent Jenkins Jr., a spokesman for Santa Ana-based WyoTech parent Corinthian Colleges Inc., said students and employees on the campus at 980 Riverside Parkway were informed of the planned closure Thursday.Jenkins said 900 students enrolled at the school will be allowed to finish their courses of study, but no new enrollments will be accepted.Jenkins said most WyoTech students are pursuing specialized diplomas or associate degrees, education plans typically encompassing two years or less.The campus employs about 75, and those workers were informed Thursday that they would be laid off.There are two other WyoTech campuses in California  in Fremont and Long Beach. There's also a west region campus in Laramie, Wyo. Jenkins said the multiple western campuses were a consideration in the closing of the West Sacramento campus.WyoTech's other two U.S. campuses are in Blairsville, Pa., and Daytona Beach, Fla.In June last year, CCI's board of directors approved a plan to sell its WyoTech campuses in West Sacramento and Daytona Beach.At that time, according to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, CCI had not secured prospective buyers but ""allocated internal resources to identify potential buyers and evaluate proposals for these campuses. Corinthian anticipates completing the sale within the next 12 months.""Within weeks of that announcement, CCI reported a $6.5 million fiscal fourth-quarter loss. The company cited losses from discontinued operations.Jenkins said CCI decided this week to retain the Daytona Beach campus, while holding out the possibility of a future sale.He added: ""In Sacramento on the other hand  we had no offers that were sufficiently attractive, and we made the decision that we were going to teach out at that campus.""CCI also is the parent of the Heald and Everest for-profit colleges. Heald oversees a dozen campuses, including sites in Roseville and Rancho Cordova.The overall CCI system has more than 100 Everest, Heald and WyoTech campuses, with about a quarter of its campuses and students in California. CCI reported a total student population of 88,688 as of Dec. 31, down from 90,910 on Dec. 31, 2011.The company reported revenue of $409.7 million for its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $392.1 million in the year-ago period. It reported a loss of $68,000 in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of nearly $1.8 million in 2011.CCI stock closed at $2.06 a share, down 7 cents, Friday on the Nasdaq Global Select market.The local WyoTech campus is a direct competitor with the Universal Technical Institute-Sacramento campus on Interstate 5 across from Sleep Train Arena."\u000a

V"Lyon thought it had done enough to advance to the Europa League's Round of 16, but Mousa Dembele struck in the 90th minute to help Tottenham collect a 1-1 draw at the Stade de Gerland on Thursday, sending the English club through 3-2 on aggregate.Gareth Bale's brace in the first leg gave Tottenham the aggregate lead heading into the return match in France, but Samuel Umtiti's away goal at White Hart Lane still gave Lyon a great chance to advance.Lyon appeared to have taken that opportunity in the second leg as Maxime Gonalons headed home a set piece in the 17th minute to give the French side the edge.With the aggregate score level and Lyon holding the tiebreaker on away goals, the Ligue 1 club looked certain to advance as time dwindled. But Dembele got Tottenham on equal terms on the night with a moment of individual brilliance on the stroke of 90 minutes, brushing a defender aside at the top of the before firing a powerful left-footed strike past Remi Vercoutre.Tottenham will take on Inter Milan in the next round after the Italian side cruised into the Round of 16 with a 3-0 defeat of CFR Cluj on Thursday, winning the tie 5-0 on aggregate. Fredy Guarin bagged a first-half brace in the second leg.Another English club was able to advance in the Europa League's set of early matches on Thursday. After a scoreless opening match, Shola Ameobi converted a second-half penalty to see Newcastle claim a 1-0 win over Metalist Kharkiv.Stuttgart was held to a 1-1 home draw in the first leg of its Europa League tie with Genk, but the Bundesliga club managed to advance with a 2-0 win in the return match on Thursday thanks to goals from Arthur Boka and Christian Gentner.The German side will take on Lazio in the next round after the Serie A club picked up a 2-0 win over Monchengladbach on Thursday. Antonio Candreva and Alvaro Gonzalez scored the goals, sending Lazio through with a 5-3 aggregate score.Liverpool fell just short of a sensational comeback at Anfield on Thursday. Despite winning the match 3-1, the Reds still bow out of the competition due to its 2-0 loss in the first leg. Zenit St. Petersburg advances on away goals to face Basel in the next round.Ajax was eliminated from the Europa League in the cruelest fashion, falling to Steaua Bucurest on penalties. Steaua Bucurest claimed a 2-0 win on the night to level the aggregate score, and following a scoreless period of extra time, the Romanian club emerged victorious from the ensuing spot-kicks.Also on Thursday, Falcao's late goal in Atletico Madrid's 1-0 win over Rubin Kazan was not enough to see the holders advance as the Russian club went through 2-1 on aggregate, Viktoria Plzen upended Napoli in a 5-0 aggregate win over the Serie A club, Hannover and Anzhi played to a 1-1 draw in Germany to see the Russian club advance 4-2 on aggregate, Fenerbahce rode Baroni Cristian's penalty to a 1-0 victory over BATE Borisov to advance,Levante cruised to a 1-0 win and a 4-0 aggregate defeat of Greek side Olympiakos, Benfica dispatched Bayer Leverkusen with a 2-1 victory and 3-1 aggregate score, Bordeaux narrowly advanced thanks to a 1-0 home win over Dynamo Kyiv to go through on a 2-1 aggregate score and Basel advanced with a 1-1 draw against Dnipro after picking up a 2-0 win in the opening leg."\u000a

V"""War Horse,"" the the World War I epic from the National Theatre of Great Britain, has galloped into San Francisco's Curran Theatre. Acclaimed as much for its theatrical spectacle and innovation as its sentimental boy-meets-horse story, the production won five 2011 Tony Awards including best play. Based on a novel by Michael Morpurgo, adapted by Nick Stafford and directed by Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris, and presented in association with Handspring Puppet Company, War Horse tells the story of Albert and his horse, Joey, who was requisitioned to be a cavalry mount for England in World War I. The national touring production is at the SHN Curran Theatre, 445 Geary St. (between Mason and Taylor). Tickets are $31- $100. For more information call (888) 746-1799 or go to shnsf.com. At 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 2 p.m. Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday through Sept. 9.In the tropicsPhotographer Jay Spooner's new show ""Heaven and Hell"" features photos from his longstanding Tropical Church project. Photos for this exhibition come from trips to Moorea, Tahiti and the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Maui, Kauai and Hawaii. Spooner culled the exhibit from thousands of photos he has taken, with half of the work presented ""naturally"" and the other ""treated"" with effects in the studio. There is an opening reception 5:30-9 p.m. Saturday at Little Relics Boutique and Galleria at 908 21st St. 'Majestic' at the minePlaywright Mark Medoff's smart, funny and underrated ""The Majestic Kid"" opens a summer run at the Kennedy Mine Amphitheatre in Jackson.

Moore's Aaron tries helping Apache Indians recover sacred land while he becomes involved in complicated romantic relationship. Luckily, the Majestic Kid comes on the scene, helping to explain all. The Main Street Theatre Works production runs Friday and Saturday nights through Sept. 8. Tickets are $12-$17.50. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. for picnics, show starts at 8 p.m. Patrons should come early with picnics, chairs and jackets. The Kennedy Mine Amphitheatre is on North Main Street in Jackson, next to the Country Squire Motel. The play contains adult language and content. For information, call (209) 295-4499 or go to www.mstw.org.History on displayTo merely state that the late Gerard A. ""Doc"" Larson was a professor of theater at Sacramento State from 1957 to 1994 massively understates his contribution to performing arts here. Larson taught and mentored countless theater students into theater professionals who now do much the same. With his legendary wife, Georgia, Larson traveled extensively, accumulating a remarkable collection of British theater history in the process. The Gerard A. and Georgia B. Larson Theatre Collection, which was donated to the university in 2011, contains over 300 separate pieces including rare playbills, programs, letters and posters associated with the history of British theater from the 18th century, with an emphasis on Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Haymarket Theatre. The collection is on display through next Friday in the CSUS University Library's Department of Special Collections and University Archives.

V"Special to the Miami Herald:  A woman who allegedly appeared in a video in which she claimed to have been paid for sex with Sen. Bob Menendez is now saying the video was a setup.An alleged Dominican prostitute who claimed on a video that she was paid to have sex with U.S. Sen Robert Menendez now says that it never happened and she was tricked into making the video.According to documents distributed to the media Monday, the woman, Nexis de los Santos Santana, and a Dominican lawyer, Miguel Galvn, entered sworn statements claiming they were duped as part of an elaborate plan hatched by a Dominican lawyer under the guise of a divorce case involving Menendezs longtime friend and donor, Dr. Salomon Melgen.I never went to bed with [Menendez or Melgen]. I dont know them, de los Santos, 23, said in the testimony. They were going to pay me a lot.She was one of two women who appeared in videos, first published last fall by the conservative website The Daily Caller, claiming to have been paid to have sex with Menendez. The senator and Melgen, a political benefactor and well-known Florida ophthalmologist, have repeatedly denied the allegations.But the doctor and senator face other problems. Menendez still faces an ethics inquiry on Capitol Hill and the doctor is involved in a federal criminal investigation.The Dominican womans testimony appeared to be the first time one of the alleged prostitutes has come forward to disprove the tawdriest of the allegations. The videos developed into an FBI investigation after a tipster, who went by Peter Williams online, provided the names of several women and the dates they supposedly were hired by Melgen and Menendez. Those claims were eventually forwarded to FBI investigators and, later, placed online.Dr. Melgen is hopeful that the appropriate authorities will identify and prosecute the people who are responsible, his attorney, Kirk Ogrosky, said in a statement to The Miami Herald. As he has maintained from day one, Dr. Melgen has been cooperating with authorities in every way possible and he denies any wrongdoing.Menendezs office had no comment when contacted Monday evening.Vinicio Castillo, a Dominican lawyer who held the Monday press conference, said that the testimonies were in the hands of the head of police, prosecutors and a special unit in charge of investigating high-tech crimes. Prosecutors last month opened a criminal investigation after Castillo filed a complaint. The prosecutors office did not respond to calls Monday.The Miami Herald could not independently verify the testimonies, entered Feb. 26 as part of a case filed in La Romana, a coastal city two hours east of the capital.But in the copies of the testimonies, de los Santos and Galvn said Dominican lawyer Melanio Figueroa approached them to record a video as part of a divorce proceeding.Galvn said he was contacted in mid-October by Figueroa to assist in a divorce case between a Dominican woman and Melgen, identified initially as a Dominican doctor who lived out of the country but who owned property in the resort development Casa de Campo.The request came weeks before Menendez was re-elected to the Senate. Menendez has pointed out the timing as evidence that the allegations are part of a political smear campaign.Galvn said he was asked to find women to record videos. He turned to de los Santos, who was supposed to ask a friend to also record a video. They met at Jumbo, an upscale grocery and department store in La Romana, according to the testimony.De los Santos was supposed to pose as a female companion of Melgen at his house in Casa de Campo, an exclusive tourism development outside of La Romana, according to her testimony.He claimed he would pay her $500, but only paid $100, Galvn said in his testimony.De los Santos said she never consented to record the video and that it was recorded with a hidden camera. However, in The Daily Caller video, in which she is allegedly the woman wearing green whose face is blurred out, she appears wearing an earpiece and answering questions.Contacted briefly by phone Monday evening, Figueroa described allegations that he orchestrated the plan as totally false.It was a case that I handled for these women and faithfully represented them for what they said, he said.Figueroa said that it has been months since he has had contact with any of the women who appeared in the videos and that he no longer represented them. These are lies by Galvn, Figueroa said. What he is saying is a lie."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/05/20/4502907/prep-baseball-playoffs-blake-franklin.html,"A month ago, Tyler Blake wasn't sure how many innings he would pitch this season. Or how effective he would be.He has a pretty clear indication now.With the 6-foot-7 junior left-hander looking fit and focused and his teammates smacking 10 hits, the Franklin Wildcats belted rival Elk Grove 9-1 Saturday in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division I North playoff game at Sacramento City College.Blake rested a tender pitching elbow for most of the season, tossed a complete-game 4-0 shutout against Grant to help secure a playoff berth and continued his dominance here. He took a shutout into the seventh inning, negating a Thundering Herd lineup known for its firepower.Although he struck out just two batters, Blake pitched effectively and also had two hits and an RBI as the Wildcats improved to 3-0 in the postseason for the first time.""I'm tired, but I feel good,"" a winded Blake said after running the postgame conditioning drills that are mandatory for all pitchers, win or lose. ""I love pitching and this team. Glad to be back on the mound.""Josh Pigg had a two-run single and Kyle Von Ruden a three-run triple to highlight a six-run third inning. On Tuesday, the Wildcats will face Davis, another familiar foe that tied Elk Grove for the Delta Valley Conference championship. Franklin finished third, though it did have wins over Elk Grove and Davis.""The guys are playing well,"" Franklin coach Bryan Kilby said. ""Tyler Blake was phenomenal on the mound, Pigg had a great game at the plate, Kyle was unbelievable (at second base), and his three-run triple was a backbreaker.""Davis 4, Vacaville 3 at Sac City  Hayden Duer had a walk-off single in the eighth inning to lift the Blue Devils, who moved to 2-0 in this unpredictable, tense tournament. Davis overcame three errors and used a double play in the eighth to avoid the losers' bracket.Davis starter Matt Trask allowed no hits and left with a 3-2 lead in the third, and reliever Reinert Toft struck out five and allowed two hits. Vacaville starter Deandre Casovia struck out four and walked six. Chris Gnos, Bobby Young and Ben Eckels each had an RBI for Davis. Vacaville will play Elk Grove on Monday night in an elimination game.Granite Bay 4, McClatchy 3 at American River College  Devin Lehman hit the go-ahead RBI single in the fifth inning, and Gabe Meza tossed two close-out innings for the Grizzlies, who took Game 1 of the best-of-three Division II series. Lehman had six RBIs in an 11-3 opening-round win over Del Campo on Friday.Rocklin 9, Woodcreek 0 at American River  In the other D-II three-game series opener, Austin Dick tossed a complete-game four-hitter with four strikeouts and one walk, and Timberwolves pitchers hit eight batters."\u000a

V"From 34 years of red and gold to a sudden return to blue and red, Dan Carmazzi said he is going home.Carmazzi confirmed Wednesday he is stepping down as Jesuit High School's football coach to become co-athletic director, assistant football coach and a U.S. government teacher at Christian Brothers.This is no ordinary switch. This is CBS, Jesuit's rival since opening in 1963 and where Carmazzi quarterbacked the Falcons in 1970 and got his coaching start later that decade.Carmazzi was the longest tenured football coach among the Sac-Joaquin Section's 197 schools. He took over the Marauders in 1981 after four years as an assistant coach under Red Smith and slowly built a championship team.In 30 seasons as head coach Carmazzi won 230 games, directed 17 playoff teams, won nine conference championships, won two of five city championship games and two Division I section titles.Deciding to leave Jesuit wasn't easy, Carmazzi said. He spoke of sleepless nights, soul searching and discussions with his wife, Gloria, and coaching friends about what to do. He said a new challenge coupled with the benefits package was too good to pass up.""I really thought I'd finish at Jesuit, wearing red and gold, but CBS out of the blue called, and I had to look at it because it's a great opportunity,"" said Carmazzi. ""CBS called before (in the 1990s), but my sons (Matt, Gio and Dominic) were at Jesuit and the timing wasn't right. It is now. I really grappled with it.  So many great things happened at Jesuit, and it's a great school.""Carmazzi insisted there was no rift with Jesuit officials that caused his move, or that he was nudged out after struggling to an overall record of 18-23 in the past four seasons playing in the demanding Delta River League that includes top area teams Folsom and Pleasant Grove.""Absolutely not true,"" Carmazzi said. ""All the coaches were coming back. We haven't had the best record in recent years despite playing hard, and those questions do arise (from fans and other coaches) when you don't win as much as you'd like. I felt good about our school support. It's all positive.""Jesuit athletic director Chris Fahey, who admitted he was ""absolutely shocked"" by Carmazzi's announcement, also downplayed any ill will.""CBS made Dan a great offer, and I can't blame him for going,"" Fahey said. ""It was my expectation that he'd be our coach. I told Dan I was going to miss him, working with him.""He taught me at Jesuit. He coached me, mentored me when I was a young coach. I'll miss that.""I told him I'll root for you every week except the Holy Bowl (the annual game between the schools), and then I'll want to kick your tail. He said the same thing. He's a great coach  and you can't find a better guy.""Carmazzi said he is eager to work with CBS head football coach George Petrissans, whose team went 1-9 last season after four consecutive playoff seasons when Petrissans was offensive coordinator. CBS last won a playoff game in 1986.For now, Carmazzi's plotting a garage sale.""I've got some really nice knee-high, red-and-gold coaching socks from the 1980s if anyone wants some,"" Carmazzi joked."\u000a

V"It's a fun, timely TV idea. It's just not as far along in its development as Mayor Kevin Johnson suggested in Thursday's State of the City address.Johnson, in announcing 2013 as the city's ""Year of Food,"" touted a 13-segment run of a reality show called ""The Change Game,"" set in farm-to-fork-happy Sacramento and promoting healthy eating and local agriculture. The mayor said the show would air on public television station KVIE. But KVIE, though highly supportive of the project, has not yet committed to airing ""Change Game,"" and the series has not yet been shot.KVIE has given ""Change Game"" creator and executive producer Rabbi David Wechsler-Azen a ""letter of interest"" based on talks with Wechsler-Azen, according to Michael Sanford, the station's vice president of content creation.See a trailer showing what 'The Change Game' reality show might look like.The letter ""officially expresses KVIE's interest in the 'Change Game' series idea, and articulates the belief that we think it's a good fit for our PBS audience,"" Sanford wrote via email.The letter also states, according to Sanford, that if ""Change Game"" ""meets KVIE and PBS editorial and technical standards, we would likely schedule it for broadcast and encourage other (PBS) stations to do so.""The mayor based his remarks Thursday on information provided by WechslerAzen, said Julia Burrows, executive director of the mayor's Greenwise Joint Venture nonprofit.""Change Game"" would feature teams of teenagers  a key demographic in healthy-eating campaigns  competing in ""Apprentice""-like challenges meant to promote healthy, local food consumption and the development of business skills.For Wechsler-Azen, the KVIE letter represents a strong enough commitment that he's going forward with fundraising and casting. He plans to cast five teams of 12 teens in April and May, and aims to start shooting in June. He has brought on Jeannine Glista, executive producer of the long-running PBS series ""BizKids,"" as a consultant.""Basically, (KVIE) is saying, 'If this turns out to be the quality we expect, we will air it,' "" Wechsler-Azen said. ""Sponsors can know this is going to air and will not end up in a bin somewhere.""""Change Game"" derives from an idea similar to that behind Fresh Producers, an after-school nonprofit that Wechsler-Azen founded and for which he serves as CEO.Fresh Producers is ""an educational program that combines nutrition, food systems  where does your food come from?  and business education,"" Wechsler-Azen said. ""We use produce to teach kids how to become producers.""Through Fresh Producers, students at some Sacramento City Unified schools sell produce during fundraisers instead of the usual candy bars or sugary snacks. When students sell healthy eating, they start to believe what they are selling, Wechsler-Azen said.Hiram Johnson High's Fresh Producers club has raised thousands of dollars over the years, Wechsler-Azen said, and two years ago sent students to an entrepreneurial competition in Chicago.Hiram Johnson student John Adams has shed 30 pounds thanks partly to knowledge gained through the club. It ""made me look at what's on the back of every bottle and can"" in terms of sugar and salt content, Adams said.Wechsler-Azen said knowledge, not dieting, is the goal of Fresh Producers and will be of ""Change Game"" as well.""Change Game"" is seeking teams representing south, North and central Sacramento and West Sacramento and Elk Grove. They will face off in challenges likely to involve visits to farm fields and interactions with local chefs. Interested teens can find out more at changegame.tv.The show ultimately will have a winner but won't eliminate contestants after challenges like other reality shows do, Wechsler-Azen said. ""It is non-elimination because we want them to keep working"" toward promotion of local agriculture and healthy eating,"" Wechsler-Azen said. ""Our premise is not, 'You are fired,' but 'You are hired.' """\u000a

V"When the First United Methodist Church in Roseville opened 130 years ago, even the bars stopped serving to pay their respects.The dedication of the Methodist house of worship on March 4, 1883, was marked by saloons closing for the day and barkeeps donating $900 to the congregation.""The entire community contributed toward the cost of the church,"" said Phoebe Astill, a fourth-generation member of the church. ""The day of the dedication, the town closed down, including the bars and brothels, so everyone could come attend the church service.""That building still stands today at the corner of Washington and Church streets on land donated by Anna F. Judah, the wife of railroad pioneer Theodore Judah. This week, church members are commemorating its founding with several events.The small church building was constructed at a cost of $2,500, using donated labor by church faithful who previously worshipped in homes and a barn.""My great-grandfather, James Astill, helped build that building,"" said Phoebe Astill. ""It is still used all the time.""Around 1907, Southern Pacific railroad moved its shops to Roseville, bringing growth and jobs. The church, however, still did not have gas service or running water in the early 1920s.Methodists are no different from other church members in their desire to gather and eat together  so a lack of utilities did not stop the congregation from cooking on the property.Women brought coal oil stoves from home and chairs were borrowed from an undertaker. In 1923, a lean-to kitchen was built for a budgeted $500. Much to the delight of the congregation, it had a sink, cupboard and gas range.The women of the congregation did not have to bring cooking utensils from home. Potatoes, it is said, were cooked in washtubs to feed hungry Methodists. A chicken dinner cost 50 cents a plate.Through the years, the church has changed names and pastors. A new church was dedicated in 1952 on the same site.The original church is still used most days of the week for meetings, and early church services on Sundays. Through the years, the congregation has included doctors, teachers, business owners and railroad employees.The membership, probably a couple hundred in number, is older than some other congregations these days, whose services are enlivened with bands, dance and guitars.""We still use the piano and the organ,"" said Astill. The current pastor is Paul Joseph Yang.A dinner and historical church program were held on Friday evening. Today, a barbecue, tours of the building and entertainment will be held from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.During Sunday service at 10:15 a.m., former pastors of the church will be participating in worship."\u000a

V"Kyran Harris rubbed his neck at halftime of Friday night's Sac-Joaquin Section Division I playoff opener and wondered why it felt out of sorts.He was a bit sore. Credit the foe and the cool conditions. And imagine the angst and pains of those who tried in vain to contain him.Harris sprinted and rumbled for 232 rushing yards and three touchdowns, and the top-seeded Franklin Wildcats pitched a second-half shutout to save face following a hideous first half to defeat No. 16 seed Nevada Union 35-14 in Elk Grove.Harris opened the scoring with a dazzling 80-yard burst, and then sealed matters with second-half scoring efforts of one and 46 yards.The Wildcats (11-0) entered the postseason as favorites in an otherwise competitive field. It was hard to tell early. Franklin had six first-half turnovers. NU (5-6) had two, and then a critical, game-changing one on the first play in the second half on its 5. That led to Harris' one-yard plunge for a 28-14 lead. Late in the first half, Robert Sanders returned an NU fumble 10 yards for a score and a 21-14 lead.The overall effort wasn't pretty, and it belies coach Mike Johnson's weekly battle cry that he doesn't ask for much. Just perfection. The only thing perfect, or close to it, here was Franklin's second-half defensive showing.A year ago, Franklin bounced NU in the first round in Grass Valley, the program's first playoff victory, then fell 56-27 at Lincoln of Stockton. The Wildcats will host Lincoln in the second round.Lincoln routed Merced on Friday. Johnson won a section title at Lincoln last decade. He's in his 10th season with Franklin.Perfection isn't entirely possible at this level, Johnson said, but he's still pushing for it. And some good fortune.""It's so true, that's my saying  perfection, or strive for it,"" Johnson said. ""To win it all, it's hard. It takes luck. Yes, you need talent and coaching, but it really is luck, too. For us, this is a second season.""No one cares what we did. If we keep winning, go 6-0 in the playoffs, then it'll be the best ride of their entire lives.""NU placed fourth in the rugged Sierra Foothill League that includes first-round Friday winners Granite Bay and Del Oro.What Johnson has is a mature, senior-ladened group with 17 returning starters.""We've got a smart group,"" Johnson said. ""We have a lot of coaches on this staff that won a championship at Lincoln. We have rings. We've been there, done that, and we understand the process.""Christian Fonbuena rushed for 104 yards for Franklin, which had five sacks and held NU to 41 rushing yards.The Miners will bid farewell to standouts in quarterback Kyle Cota and receiver Ian Davis (they hooked up for 12-yard touchdown pass to pull to within 14-7) and linebackers Tanner Vallejo and Hank Humphers.Might this be the end of the coaching career for NU's Dave Humphers, at the Miners' helm since 1991? He won't concede anything, but area coaches are talking about it, including Johnson.""He's done it all,"" Johnson said. ""He may be ready to retire and rock and roll.""For the Wildcats, they'll continue to march to an unbeaten tune."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/01/04/5088652/juvenile-in-justice-a-tough-valuable.html,"One picture shows a 12-year-old boy in a yellow jumpsuit staring at the wall of a tiny, windowless cell at a Mississippi detention center. Another zooms in on the bruised and blackened eye of a 14-year-old Oklahoma girl locked up for running away from a group home.A third depicts a 10-year-old Nevada boy, barefoot and beltless in a white, concrete intake cell with a sandwich and a small carton of milk.The stark images are part of an exhibit, ""Juvenile-In-Justice,"" that photographer Richard Ross hopes will bring changes in the way the nation deals with what he said are the roughly 70,000 youths held in detention or correctional facilities across the country on any given night  many of them for offenses no more serious than skipping school.""These are no places for kids,"" said the longtime art professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, adding that he is on a mission to test the limits of the ""power of images in social advocacy.""""I'm not a criminologist or a sociologist,"" he said. ""I'm just trying to help arm those people, give them visual tools they don't have to make their case. They can show policymakers this is real.""The exhibit at the Nevada Museum of Art through Jan. 13  and a book of the same name  are the product of Ross spending parts of the past five years photographing and interviewing more than 1,000 incarcerated youths at more than 300 facilities in 30 states.Excerpts of the interviews supplement the pictures: ""I spend all day and all night in here,"" said a 16-year-old boy in a cell at South Bend (Ind.) Juvenile Correctional Facility. ""No mattress, no sheets and I get all my meals through this slot.""A 14-year-old boy at the Pueblo (Colo.) Youth Services Center held on a gun charge and probation violation said: ""I've been in 15, maybe 16 times.  My dad can't visit 'cause he has warrants out against him. He's in a gang. So are my four brothers.""The stories and the settings are all too familiar to Shawn Marsh.""It is an accurate reflection,"" said Marsh, who worked in a number of facilities and now is director of the Juvenile and Family Law Department at the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. ""In many ways, the photographs are mild. They don't show the abusive side.""These are not facilities that encourage even the best of the best to be human,"" he said.It's a very different view of the world than Ross, 65, used to capture as principal photographer on a number of architectural projects at the Getty Conservation Institute and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, or shooting pictures for the New York Times, Harpers and others.""I spent years and years  maybe too much time really  doing beautiful things, creating things with lines and texture, shape and form,"" said Ross, who quotes Booker T. Washington in the book saying: ""The study of art that does not result in making the strong less willing to oppress the weak means little.""""I lecture more now at law schools than art schools,"" he said. ""People are using my images not only in museums, which is great, but also in public policy.""That includes Rebecca Gasca, a juvenile justice advocate and consultant with the Campaign for Youth Justice who intends to take his book with her on lobbying trips to the Nevada Legislature. ""We need to put this on coffee tables in every legislator's office,"" Gasca said.The project  which opened last year in Paris and is off next to Chicago, Atlanta and New York City  became possible initially when Ross won a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation.With prior experience photographing juvenile detainees, he began to take a more thorough look at the situation and became convinced it was a project he had to do during a visit with a juvenile justice instructor in El Paso, Texas.""I asked him, 'Do you ever think you'll be so successful that you'll be out of a job?' He said, 'Not as long as the state of Texas keeps making 10-year-olds.' ""Over the following five years, Ross sat on bunks and floors, listening to their stories. ""They work with me on how we can take their pictures without their faces,"" he said.Public radio's Ira Glass, host of ""This American Life,"" wrote the forward for the 192-page book that the Annie E. Casey Foundation helped support along with the overall project.William F. Dressel, president of the National Judicial College at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a former judge in Colorado, hopes the exhibit will help lead to reforms. He said there will always be a need for consequences for delinquent behavior, but that the system today is extreme.""I want you to understand that the vast majority of these kids in these pictures have not been found guilty of anything,"" he said.

He would play the High Sierra Theater at the hotel several more times until his last date in May 1976, each visit prompting huge press and long lines, along with increasing prices.In 1973 he donated money to Barton Memorial Hospital in South Lake Tahoe for its new intensive care unit (now named for his mother, Gladys); five days after doing so he was admitted with the flu and had to cancel his remaining concerts.It has become traditional in the past few years for casinos to celebrate the King's birthday (his 78th would have been Tuesday) during the post- holiday slump. Impersonators are booked practically everywhere to celebrate the man who entered the Nevada showroom market and changed it forever.

V"Kennedy was the last hope of the night Saturday for public school girls basketball in the Sac-Joaquin Section championships at Sleep Train Arena.And for nearly three quarters, the defending Division I champions from Greenhaven matched perennial section power St. Mary's of Stockton basket for basket.But there is a reason the Rams are ranked No. 17 nationally by USA Today and No. 4 in California by Cal-Hi Sports.They wear teams down with their talent, depth and versatility, and the top-seeded Rams did just that in beating the No. 3 Cougars 63-47 to capture their first D-I banner and section-leading 14th overall.Brijanee Moore had 27 points and seven steals, dazzling Unique Coleman added 15 points and six rebounds, and Natalie Delgado had 11 points, including two three-point bank shots, for St. Mary's (29-2).Katie Lee had 12 points and three assists, and Lynette Johnson, who played all 32 minutes despite tweaking an already gimpy right ankle in the first half, had nine points and 17 rebounds for Kennedy (24-6).""I'm proud of our effort. I'm proud of my players,"" Cougars coach Dave Parsh said. ""We executed the game plan pretty well, but I think we ran out of gas at the end. They are deep and in great shape.""Kennedy consistently broke down St. Mary's vaunted press and led or tied eight times. But after Dalayna Tyler-Scott's basket put the Cougars ahead 36-35 with four minutes to play in the third quarter, the Rams outscored Kennedy 28-11 the rest of the way. St. Mary's had 17 steals and forced 27 turnovers.With St. Mary's being elevated to D-I and Sacramento High, a public charter school without enrollment boundaries, winning in D-II, private/charter schools swept all divisions for the second time in three seasons. Previous to St. Francis winning in 2011, only public schools had won D-I girls titles.""St. Mary's is nationally renowned, so to get to battle a Goliath is a great opportunity for us,"" Parsh said. ""But I'd like to see a level playing field. You don't see that many good athletes at a public school.""With St. Mary's likely headed to the new CIF Northern California Regional Open Division, Parsh said it may be easier for a public school program like his to compete for a NorCal D-I banner.  Division IVBradshaw Christian 50, Bear River 40  Making 13 of 15 free throws in the final quarter, the third-seeded Pride (27-2) defeated the top-seeded Bruins (26-4) in a battle of two of the section's most successful girls programs.Sophomore Erika Bean had 19 points and three steals, senior Ashlee Jones had 18 points and seven rebounds, and sophomore Jordyn Bell had nine points and 10 rebounds for Bradshaw Christian, playing its second season in D-IV.Junior Kaitlyn Reina led Bear River with 19 points and nine rebounds despite missing nearly six minutes in the second half after rolling her right ankle.Reina went out with her team leading 32-28 late in the third quarter. She returned midway through the fourth quarter, promptly hit a three-pointer to put Bear River ahead 39-38, then fouled out with 2:55 to play.The Pride outscored the Bruins 20-6 in the final eight minutes.For the Bruins, it was their 14th section title appearance, having won 10 times. This was Bradshaw Christian's fifth section title (four previously in D-V) in as many tries."\u000a

V"The weekend storm complicated cleanup from Sunday morning's California International Marathon, as runners donned garbage bags for rain protection, then discarded the bags as they warmed up.Race director John Mansoor said runners normally discard outer layers of clothing, and volunteers collect the clothing for charity. But because of the rainy weather, runners opted for the cheap, disposable option of cutting arm and neck holes in plastic garbage bags.Once they got hot, runners simply tore off the bags and dropped them on the pavement. Collection was made more challenging because the bags were scattered by the wind.Some runners reported that the discarded bags became slick and posed a safety hazard on the course.Mansoor said that once the California Highway Patrol reopened roads to vehicle traffic, including Folsom-Auburn and Fair Oaks boulevards and Oak Avenue, it became dangerous for volunteers to pick up the litter.About 11,000 people ran in various events in the race, but most of those using bags as rain gear were the marathoners, Mansoor said. While he doesn't know how many participants wore the bags, he said, ""we're talking quite a few garbage bags.""Volunteers wearing reflective vests drove up and down the course Sunday and Monday working to find and clear litter from roadways, but Mansoor's top priority was to collect trash safely, he said, so the job may take longer than usual.He asked residents to call the race headquarters at (916) 983-4622 to report trash along the route."\u000a

""We're not stalling. But there are a lot of kids involved.""Del Campo and San Juan Unified School District officials also are investigating the incident.""We are conducting a full investigation based on the video, statements from those involved and statements from the game's officials,"" San Juan district community relations director Trent Allen said in an e-mail.""Based on the outcome of that investigation, any of our players found to have exited the dugout or thrown any punches will face disciplinary actions which may include suspension from one or more games in accordance with district and CIF rules.""

V"Former Jesuit infielder Vinnie Catricala didn't make the Seattle Mariners' roster to start the season, but the 23-year-old certainly seems to be in the team's short-range plans. Last season, Catricala was the Mariners' Minor League Player of the Year. Between Class A and Double A, he hit .349 with 25 home runs and 106 RBIs. Catricala, who opened eyes this spring in Arizona by hitting .313 with two homers and seven RBIs, is assigned to the Tacoma Rainiers, the Mariners' Triple-A team. ""If you asked me my senior year of high school where I see myself in six or seven years, honestly, at the time, I wouldn't have said this,"" Catricala told the Seattle Times recently. ""This wasn't my dream. I was just playing baseball, doing the best I could. It's kind of weird, but it feels right."" Catricala was a 10th-round draft choice by the Mariners in 2009. He hit a team-best .349 that season for the University of Hawaii with 13 homers and 44 RBIs. He led the team in runs scored (51), walks (36) and on-base percentage (.447). His senior year at Jesuit, Catricala hit .388 with 25 RBIs and 10 doubles. Jeff Caraska"\u000a

V"Josiah Johnson was shocked and surprised at the end of his sophomore season when Sacramento High football coach Paul Doherty asked him if he'd be willing to play quarterback in the Dragons' evolving spread offense.A ferocious hitter and tackler, the senior had been a defense-only player since he started playing at the age of 8.""He couldn't throw a football to save his life, but he has a high football IQ because he's been playing football his whole life,"" Doherty said of the former defensive back.Credit Johnson's amazing work ethic for turning himself into more than just a credible passer and runner.Saturday against Valley, Johnson completed 10 of 16 passes for 172 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for 104 yards and two touchdowns  all in the first half  as Sacramento pounded undermanned Valley 73-0 during the Dragons' festive homecoming celebration.The Metro Conference victory made Sacramento (6-2, 4-1) playoff eligible and kept the Dragons rolling toward their goal of hosting their first on-campus playoff game.Much credit goes to Johnson, who ranks fourth in the Sac-Joaquin Section and 13th in the state in passing yards (2,256) and has passed for 27 touchdowns and rushed for six more. Last season, he passed for 2,340 yards and 23 touchdowns.All this from someone who thought he'd be the last guy asked to be a quarterback.""At first, I didn't know what coach Doherty was thinking,"" Johnson said. ""I said, 'Coach, are you sure?' But when he told me it would be the best thing for the team, I decided to step up and put the work in for it.""Did he ever. He'd nag the already dedicated Doherty to work with him even on holidays.""He's been throwing a football six days a week since November of his sophomore year,"" Doherty said. ""Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's.""Johnson learned much participating in The Passing Academy, put on by former NFL and/or college players Troy Taylor, Bobby Fresques and Doug Cosbie, the former Dragons' coach who brought Doherty to Oak Park after he played for Cosbie at Menlo College in Atherton.Another mentor is former Sac High quarterback Jonathan Kodama, now at American River College.""The biggest thing Jonathan has helped me with is keeping my composure, to stay even-keeled,"" Johnson said. ""If I tank, then the whole team tanks.""But if the sturdy 6-foot, 185-pound Johnson had his way, he would have spent more than just a handful of plays on defense Saturday. His teammates had a field day against a Valley team that dressed just 20 players.Davion Simmons returned two fumbles for touchdowns and Terrell Craig added a third score by way of a fumble.Sophomore Jimmy Hatch had a 31-yard interception return for a touchdown while the Dragons held the Vikings (1-7, 1-4) to minus-23 total yards.Johnson transferred to Sac High from Valley at the end of his freshman year so even though he was happy to win, he felt for the Vikings, who faced defending Metro champion Burbank and Sac High on back-to-back weekends.""I commend those kids for continuing to play,"" Johnson said. ""I know they didn't come out here to have 73 points put on them. But they kept playing hard. A lot of people would quit, because quitting is the easy thing to do."""\u000a

V"Former Elk Grove schools chief Robert Trigg said Thursday he has accepted an invitation to serve an unfinished term on the Elk Grove City Council created when Councilman Gary Davis was sworn in as mayor in December.Trigg, in an interview, said he received a telephone call late Wednesday from Davis and agreed to accept the post.The offer was extended after the council met and made a last-ditch bid to break its repeated deadlocks on five of six candidates. On each of those council votes, the split was 2-2.The proposal to look outside the list of contenders was intended to avoid a costly special election in June, council members said.Councilman Pat Hume proposed Trigg, and the nomination won in a 3-1 vote. Councilman Jim Cooper was opposed, noting that the decision came without public participation and was discussed only after the public comment period closed.""The public was excluded,"" Cooper said. ""That's poor policy.""Cooper had been a steadfast supporter of contender Nancy De Anda Chaires, whom he had appointed to the city Planning Commission five years ago.Trigg retired as superintendent of the Elk Grove Unified School District in 1995 after a career in education spanning 35 years. He is 78. He was not at the meeting.Trigg is to be sworn into office at the council's Feb. 13 meeting. He is to remain in the post until a candidate wins the seat in the 2014 election and is sworn into office.He told The Bee he agreed to step in so the city could avoid the special election.County officials have put the cost at upward of $550,000.""Is it something I had planned or really wanted?

""But I think, if there is an opportunity to help, I owe the community that.""Hume's nomination proposal won support from Mayor Davis and Councilman Steve Detrick.Reaction after the meeting was mixed. The council late last year had created a process in which candidates would apply for the post and be interviewed before one was picked.But the five-member council, with one seat vacant, couldn't pull it off.Chaires, in a statement she posted on Facebook, said abandoning that process meant the nominee was not vetted.""This episode illustrates the need for more transparency in our government and respect for its citizens,"" Chaires wrote. ""I remain committed to bringing about the government that Elk Grove residents want and deserve.""Chaires has said that she plans to run for the office in the 2014 election. Another of the six candidates, small-business owner Oscar Portillo O'con, said he was happy with the council's decision.""I think it's a good choice,"" O'con said. ""He (Trigg) is a good man. He is good for the community. He is good for business."" Davis, on his own Facebook page, said the decision was difficult.""I wish we weren't deadlocked, but we were,"" the mayor wrote. ""From my perspective, the only alternative was to choose someone above reproach who had not applied for the position.""Trigg has ""a long and distinguished career serving Elk Grove both as Superintendent of EGUSD and President of the State Board of Education,"" Davis wrote. He said Trigg will not seek election in 2014.Trigg, asked if he might warm up to the idea of running for the office in 2014, reinforced Davis' perspective.""No,"" he said. ""Not at all. Not even a little bit."""\u000a

V"If Sacramento High School girls coach Michele Massari knows how many consecutive league games her team has won, she won't say.The streak precedes her five years at the Oak Park charter school.But the players are well aware of it. And no one wants to be a member of the team that sees ""The Streak"" end.So Thursday's showdown at No. 3 Kennedy was more than a battle of Metro Conference unbeatens and defending Sac-Joaquin Section champions, Sacramento in Division III and Kennedy in D-I.It turned into a stunning crowd pleaser with plenty of big plays, dramatic moments and, for Sacramento, a rare down-to-the-wire finish in league play.Sacramento prevailed 53-49, extending its league winning streak  sorry, Michele  to 83 games. The top-ranked Dragons haven't lost a league contest since Jan. 18, 2006, when they were in the Capital Athletic League.""We're aware of it, and we want to defend the history of the school every time we take the court,"" said senior Allie Green, who had a game-high 22 points on 10-of-20 shooting from the floor. It was her best performance of the season after she missed the 2011-12 campaign because of a knee injury.The Pepperdine scholarship signee scored seven fourth-quarter points and hit two baskets late when Kennedy twice cut Sacramento's lead to two points.Junior guard Zonyia Cormier added 11 points for Sacramento (15-2, 6-0), and freshman guard Aliceah Hernandez had seven, including two free throws with 7.7 seconds to play for the final margin of victory.Senior post Dalayna Tyler-Scott led Kennedy (14-4, 5-1) with 14 points, versatile Lynette Johnson added 12, and Katie Lee had nine, all on three-pointers.""I love these type of games,"" Massari said. ""They help build our character.""Sacramento is off to its best start under Massari, having won its own St. Hope Classic and finished third in two prestigious out-of-area tournaments.And more is ahead.The Dragons will play Hanford at 1 p.m. Saturday and defending D-II state champion Archbishop Mitty of San Jose at 6 p.m. Monday in the Martin Luther King Showcase at St. Mary's High School in Stockton."\u000a

V"Patrick Scott is no stranger to Eppie's Great Race. He helped organize the first race in 1974 and has participated in nearly 30 races since, having completed about 15 of them in the Ironman division  kayaking, bicycling and running. But this Saturday, this Great Race veteran will experience a first as he participates in the race as a limited quadriplegic.Scott, 65, lost the use of his legs and fingers last August in a bike accident on a street in Orangevale. On Saturday, he will complete the running portion of the race as a member of an adaptive team that includes his son and daughter.Scott will be using a special wheelchair that has been equipped with levers to ""run"" the 5.82 miles that are required of him before his daughter, Sarah Crook, 37, bikes 12.5 miles through River Bend Park. Crook will then hand off the team wristband to her brother, David Scott, 35, who will paddle his way down 6.35 miles of the American River to finish the race for Team Crazy Spokes, as they call themselves.""I was told after my accident that I had no triceps and I refused to believe that,"" said Scott. ""My muscles had atrophied so much that you couldn't notice them, but Eppie's has been my motivation to get them back.""Scott's children and sister, Sue Scott Williams, will walk alongside him during his portion of the race to ensure that his wheelchair doesn't veer off course.""Everyone's coming out to support me, and to keep me from rolling into the dirt,"" Scott said.Scott was out for a casual bike ride with friends Aug. 21 when his front tire suddenly stopped, causing him to flip over his handlebars and land on a speed bump. The accident left Scott with a smashed right shoulder blade, four muscle tears in his right shoulder, six broken ribs and a broken neck.""It was supposed to be an easy ride,"" said Scott. ""I still don't really know what happened.""Scott was originally taken to a local hospital but was soon transferred via helicopter to Craig Hospital in Denver. The Colorado hospital specializes in the rehabilitation of patients with spinal cord and traumatic brain injuries, and while they tend to accept younger patients with a greater rate of recovery, Scott's history of athleticism persuaded the hospital staff to offer him a bed.""Over in Denver, that's where they really saved my life,"" Scott recalled.The accident cost him the use of his legs and fingers, but Scott retained the use of his arms. His medical condition is referred to as limited quadriplegia because of the limited use of his fingers, explained Scott's wife, Carol.Despite his injuries, however, Scott was determined to maintain his athleticism.""Before the accident he was riding (his bike) 100 miles a week, going to the gym two or three times a week, golfing three times a week and hitting balls at the driving range two or three times a week,"" explained Williams. ""And after the accident, well mentally, he was still an athlete.""Scott knew he wanted to keep Eppie Johnson's annual race as a part of his schedule.""I told the paramedics, 'I'm going to do Eppie's,' "" said Scott. ""That's one of the few things I remember from that day.""At Craig Hospital, Scott worked toward this goal by undergoing six hours of physical therapy a day over the course of three months. When he finally returned home to Mather, he started working out on his own by lifting weights and taking his manual wheelchair out into the street.As he began to get his strength back, Scott realized he would need something better than a typical wheelchair to make it through the entire 5.82 miles that Eppie's demanded of him.""He doesn't have a normal grip,"" said his wife, ""and it was really hard for him to throw (the wheels of) a manual wheelchair.""In February, Scott met with Brian M. Watwood, founder of the Wijit Lever and Braking System, who introduced him to a wheelchair that appeared much better equipped for him and his physical goals.Watwood, who became a limited quadriplegic when he was hit by a car, designed the Wijit system to prevent upper extremity injuries in wheelchair users. According to Watwood, the system reduces the effort it takes to self-propel a chair by 50 percent and cuts the number of daily pushes in half.""Because (the Wijit) was designed and conceptualized by me, and I'm a disabled person, it's intuitive for another disabled person, like the Patrick Scotts of the world, to use,"" said Watwood. The Wijit system provided Scott with the mobility he needed while also allowing him to work on strengthening his arms and core. Since February, Scott has ventured out into the street several times a week to prepare for Saturday's race, and has even gone over to the race course to accommodate himself to the terrain.""I don't know what there is about Eppie's Great Race that motivates people to work this hard,"" said founder Eppie Johnson. ""It's great. It makes people want to do their best.""But this Saturday isn't the end of the road for Scott. After Eppie's, Scott plans on joining his neurosurgeon in an attempt to put together a team to run from San Francisco to Calistoga in September, a total distance of about 75 miles.""I'd have to do 18 miles for that,"" said Scott with a smile. ""I'm not stopping with Eppie's."""\u000a

V"The subject of California's first ""Silver Alert,"" an 82-year-old Elk Grove man who went missing, was found early this morning 70 miles away in Grass Valley.Robert Grappi relies on regular medication and has shown signs of dementia, according to Officer Christopher Trim, Elk Grove Police Department spokesman.Grappi left his Elk Grove home about 3:30 p.m. Monday after arguing with his wife. He was believed to be driving his 1998 Toyota RAV4 to his son's house in Nevada County, but he never arrived.Police knew Grappi's credit card was used twice at Grass Valley gas stations early Tuesday.Grappi was found this morning about 3 a.m. by Grass Valley police after they conducted a vehicle stop. He was checked by ambulance personnel and given a clean bill of health before being returned to family, police said.Grass Valley police first suspected Grappi was a driving under the influence when they spotted his vehicle. Once an officer had a chance to speak with Grappi, it was discovered that he was reported missing from Elk Grove.""He was very cooperative and was picked up by his son-in-law here at the police department,"" said Capt. Rex Marks with the Grass Valley police department.Starting Tuesday, the California Highway Patrol began issuing bulletins called Silver Alerts in cases where at-risk people 65 and older go missing. The Grappi notification was distributed to authorities and media outlets in Sacramento, Placer and Nevada counties about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.However, Grappi was not located due to the new Silver Alert, police said. Finding him had more to do with an observant officer in a small town seeing someone driving in manner that suggested he was under the influence.""We are a small community and at 3 a.m. pretty much anything that is moving is suspect,"" said Marks. ""Fortunately, he was found safe and sound.""Marks said Grappi indicated that he was ""visiting the high country"" and that he was lucid at the time.""Obviously he was very fatigued, quite tired,"" said Marks. ""He was quite happy to see our officers.""Unlike Amber Alerts, the decade-old system used to locate missing children, Silver Alerts do not appear on electronic highway signs.The CHP issues alerts based on several criteria, including health risks, inclement weather, suspicious circumstances or other perilous conditions.Elk Grove police learned late Monday that Grappi was missing, Trim said. After working on the case overnight, they informed the CHP they had a Silver Alert candidate. The CHP decides whether to issue an alert.Trim said his department typically issues news releases in such cases, but those don't have as broad a reach as the new Silver Alerts."\u000a

V"This game didn't score much with style points by any means, and judging by coach John DePonte's postgame frown, a crash course is in order to clean things up with the next, taller hurdle looming.The Pleasant Grove Eagles won their first Northern California Division I boys basketball game Wednesday night in Elk Grove by doing just enough to hold off scrappy, athletic Castlemont of Oakland 64-57.There was a degree of satisfaction in that achievement, to be sure, but there wasn't an Eagles player, coach, fan, parent or booster to be found who would scream that this was a championship effort.Pleasant Grove (24-6) had moments of good play  sharing the ball and defending  but there were enough erratic stretches to make any coach or team captain groan.Next is the proverbial beast of the East Bay, as in top-seeded De La Salle of Concord, the defending NorCal champion and a decades-long power that emphasizes defense and team play to smother teams.Pleasant Grove plays at De La Salle on Saturday in a second-round NorCal contest and is every bit capable of competing, yes, but can it do more? A win would surely rate as a stunner given the season results for both teams, with De La Salle fresh off its 10th North Coast Section title and Pleasant Grove advancing to the NorCals as a Sac-Joaquin Section semifinalist.""We should be at the point of the season where we shouldn't have to clean up anything,"" DePonte said. ""It's some of the same mistakes, same turnovers that keep teams in (games) and hurt us. We can play better.""Pleasant Grove played without floor leader guard Malik Thames, who was out because of the flu, but it got solid efforts from the usual crew of Cody Demps (20 points), Cole Nordquist (13) and Matt Hayes (11). In addition, Matt Smrekar, Caleb Jackson, Ben Nguyen and D.J. Dunn provided valuable minutes and contributions.Dunn, an All-Metro linebacker headed to the Air Force Academy, said his team is excited about the challenge of facing De La Salle, understanding that a Pleasant Grove victory would rattle the field. What's more, a De La Salle contest is his kind of fight. Dunn is a powerfully built inside player who lives to get physical, which is De La Salle in every regard.""That's what I love  a physical game,"" Dunn said, all smiles. ""We know we can play better, and we know we have to play a perfect game. We can do it.""Pleasant Grove girls 66, Palo Alto 56  Despite not having point guard Marissa Wimbley (knee), the Eagles pulled a road upset behind Avonna Lee (18 points) and Deja James (15) and a 10-0 run to finish the game. Pleasant Grove was coming off an emotionally charged section semifinal loss to Kennedy."\u000a

V"The Kennedy High School girls basketball team has not reached this point on talent alone. In fact, it's another ""T"" word that tells the tale of its success this playoff season: Trust.The Cougars played the final 1:20 of a pressure-packed Northern California Division I first-round game Wednesday without standout junior Lynette Johnson and gutted out a 52-49 win over Castlemont of Oakland.With the score tied 43-43 with just under four minutes to play, sophomore guard Jessica Lauderdale hit two free throws to give the Cougars (24-8) a two-point edge.""I get nervous sometimes,"" Lauderdale said after the game. ""But I always feel like I can do it because I've got all these girls behind me helping me out. We all trust each other.""Several possessions later, Lauderdale stepped in front of Castlemont's Tynisha Adams, set her feet, and took a charge, denying the Lady Knights of an easy layup attempt. On the ensuing trip down the floor, Lauderdale hit the Cougars' lone three-pointer of the second half to put them up by five points.""Everyone on the team has a certain skill set,"" Kennedy coach Dave Parsh said. ""And the five on the floor at any one time know each other well enough to take advantage of those skills.""Castlemont (16-12) got its deficit to 48-47 and appeared ready to pounce when Johnson fouled out.""I was really disappointed to be out, but I couldn't show it,"" Johnson said. ""I had to stay positive and let them know that I believed in them.""Her sub, senior swing Mele Kolokihakaufisi, hit a spinning circus shot in the lane with 30 seconds left for what proved to be the winning margin. Senior forward Amayla Greer hit both of her free throws with 5.7 seconds remaining to make the score 52-49.Adams picked up the ball after it rolled all the way over the timeline, dribbled once and heaved a long three-point attempt with four seconds left. The ball hit the backboard and fell into Lauderdale's waiting hands, and she hugged it like a life preserver until the buzzer sounded.It appeared early on that Kennedy, which won a double-overtime thriller over Oak Ridge in the Sac-Joaquin Section final Saturday, was going to run away from the Oakland Athletic League runner-up, as the Cougars led 9-2 and 14-7 in the first quarter. Castlemont closed the period on a 6-0 run, led by Kaya Johnson, who finished with 17 points."\u000a

V"Armond Armstead stopped by familiar turf Friday night in Elk Grove, his grin and good cheer the only things more striking than his 6-foot-5, 290-pound frame.Freshly signed by the New England Patriots, the defensive tackle embraced teachers and coaches at Pleasant Grove High School. He waved to family friends and alumni. Mostly, Armstead leaned against the baseline wall in the crowded gym because there were no available seats  and it was an attempt to stop his head from spinning.Armstead's story has been well chronicled. He starred at USC and was projected by scouts as an NFL first-round draft pick. Armstead's draft hopes, however, were squashed when he suffered a heart attack. Viewed as a risk and damaged goods despite a battery of tests giving him a clean bill of health, he went undrafted. Armstead last August sued USC, claiming he was recklessly administered painkilling injections that, his doctors say, caused the heart attack.Armstead had a productive season in the Canadian Football League this fall for the Grey Cup champion Toronto Argonauts. More than 15 NFL teams inquired about bringing in Armstead for a workout, and he signed a three-year deal with the Patriots. After his Elk Grove visit, he reported to the Patriots on Sunday.Armstead has been instructed by his new bosses not to discuss his NFL status. He did offer this: ""I'm doing great.""Argonauts general manager Jim Barker told ESPNBoston.com the Patriots landed the equivalent of a top pick: ""I don't think it's very often that an NFL team can get a first-round pick without using a first-round pick.""Jesuit lineman picks DartmouthJesuit High offensive lineman Garrett Strohmaier has verbally committed to Dartmouth of the Ivy League.Strohmaier is an honors student who said he appreciated the academic and football tradition of Dartmouth, never mind all the snow in Hanover, N.H., at this time of year.Prep hazing falloutSt. Patrick/St. Vincent High in Vallejo terminated football coach Chris Cerbone and expelled five players for a sexual hazing incident on younger players last fall.

""I live for this. I play for my team, my school, my family, my friends  and for my dad. Always my dad. He'd love this team.""He'd love the guard, too. Good is a senior honors student who aspires to study science and chemistry in college. He won't play football after this fall, realizing there's not much of a market for 5-foot-10, 195-pound blockers. So it's no wonder Good plays every snap as if it means something.Good's father, Bobby, died in 2002 from liver failure. A construction worker, the elder Good suffered with a broken body. He fell off a two-story building. He blew out discs in his back and crushed his shoulder. The job's grind also caused him to blow out a knee six times. Good wonders about his father, who and what he was, and he found some closure to that query this summer. In talking to teammate Hank Humphers, they realized Good played at Mira Loma in 1982, the same time Humphers' father, Dave, got his coaching start. Dave Humphers now heads the Nevada Union program. Good scrambled to find Mira Loma football game programs from his grandmother to connect the dots, then raced to the Humphers' house to connect some more. Coach Humphers did coach Bobby, and he recalled a tough, cooperative pupil. Bobby Good was a halfback who wore jersey No. 22.""It was pretty emotional but neat at the same time,"" coach Humphers said. ""We had no idea.""Said Good, ""Pretty crazy. Coach Humphers knew my dad more than I knew my dad. He told me about side talks and motivational speeches he had with my dad. It was very powerful. This really makes it special for me.

Almost bamboolike, the graceful leaves are striped with bright, silvery white. That striping carries over to the pale-green flower heads, which make excellent dried arrangements. The one drawback: All parts of this plant are toxic. You can see specimens in the arboretum teaching nursery on the UC Davis campus.Why it's a favorite: ""A bamboolike grass (but not invasive) with graceful, drooping seed heads,"" said arboretum volunteer Christy Dewees.

V"HOME CHECKLIST  The final weeks of winter can seem like the longest. You're aching for spring and eager to get outdoors  if only the weather cooperates.There's plenty to keep you busy indoors  you just need to focus. Courtesy of State Farm Insurance's Learning Center, here are some suggestions for late-winter projects to make your home safer, cleaner and cozier: Clean out clutter. This task probably is still waiting on your list of New Year's resolutions. Give yourself a head start on spring cleaning by streamlining the contents of overloaded shelves and overflowing drawers. Get rid of items you no longer need.Where to start? In your kitchen, toss out expired goods from the back of your cabinets or pantry, and then rearrange shelves by product.In the garage, reorganize a cluttered workbench or overcrowded storage cabinet to store items safely. In the bathroom, dispose of expired medications. Corral scattered supplies such as bandages and pain reliever into a first-aid kit. Replace slippery rugs. According to the National Safety Council, falls are the second-leading cause of accidental deaths at home. Remove that danger by replacing worn area rugs. Add a non-slip pad under each rug to give it a good grip. A new rug can give a room a new look, too. Freshen the kitchen. Give it a quick and inexpensive update with a fresh coat of paint. Refresh cabinet doors with new hardware. Replace a worn faucet or stained sink. Add a pretty tile backsplash. Clean your dryer vent. If your clothes are taking longer than usual to dry, this could be a sign that it's time to clean the vent. Proper maintenance also is key to preventing dryer fires. Always clean the lint trap after each dryer run. Regularly inspect the exhaust vent and clean out the built-up lint and debris.For more ideas, click on http://learningcenter.statefarm.com.GARDEN CHECKLISTIt's starting to feel a lot like spring  which means it's time to fertilize:  Feed fruit trees before flowers open with a fertilizer specifically labeled for fruit trees. Feed other mature trees and shrubs as spring growth appears. Feed strawberries and asparagus. Feed spring-blooming plants and established perennials. Check for aphids on new growth. Knock them off with a strong spray of water or a squirt of insecticidal soap. Look out for snails and slugs. Hand-pick them off plants an hour after nightfall. In the vegetable garden, plant seed for beets, carrots, celeriac, celery, collards, endive, fennel, jicama, kale, leaf lettuce, mustard, peas, potatoes, radish, spinach, Swiss chard and turnips. In the greenhouse or indoors, start seed for summer and winter squash, peppers, eggplant and tomatoes. They'll be ready to transplant in late April or May. For spring and summer flowers, plant seed for aster, cornflower, cosmos, larkspur, nasturtium, nicotiana, periwinkle, portulaca, rudbeckia, salvia, snapdragon, verbena and zinnia.

V"""We are heading into the studio in December to start in earnest on a new album. It's been 17 years, and so it's a big deal for us.""Glen Phillips, the lead singer of Toad the Wet Sprocket, is genuinely excited for the new venture. The band, which includes guitarist Todd Nichols, bassist Dean Dinning, and drummer Randy Guss, produced a pretty steady stream of hits back in the early 1990s  ""All I Want,"" ""Walk on the Ocean,"" ""Fall Down,"" and ""Something's Always Wrong,"" the principal ones.But that last title heralded an eventual breakup in 1996. Since their reuniting for occasional engagements six years ago, and then completely three years ago, they've performed primarily as a retro act  happy to do so as they primarily will at Harrah's Tahoe but also eager to try themselves in a new age.""The record company two decades ago gave us time to grow, but it's all product now. And everything has changed. I remember when we bought actual albums and, even if we were not happy with one we would still play it over and over until we found something we liked. Now, we can have 20,000 songs on our iPad and we have Pandora.""On the good side, that's why there are so many cool bands now.""Phillips himself didn't take much time off when Toad disbanded (""I've been obscure but I've never stopped""). He released several albums on his own and played in three other bands: Works Progress Administration, Plover and Remote Tree Children.Toad the Wet Sprocket was a radio-friendly band, and Phillips attributes their sound to Nichols' unique way of playing guitar, as well as to their mix of two guitars, bass and drum.He says the new songs have been generated pretty much the way the old ones were with the other band members starting the creation and his finishing it up, but ""even though we'll write the old-fashioned way, we will not be anachronistic.

V"Some events never lose their charm  or their drawing power.Camellias continue to captivate Sacramento. Thousands of flower fans will turn out this weekend for the 89th Sacramento Camellia Show and sale at Memorial Auditorium.Featuring hundreds of flowers, this free event remains a must-see tradition. For the past three years, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson took time out from his hectic schedule to officially open the show, noted Carol Schanz, president of the Camellia Society of Sacramento. He's expected again today.Johnson isn't the only local dignitary to come smell the camellias. After his return to Sacramento as a downtown resident, Gov. Jerry Brown dropped by unannounced to tour a recent show while walking first dog Sutter.""He just wanted to see the camellias,"" recalled club secretary Julie Vierra. ""Everybody was really excited. He said he went to shows with his mother when he was a child and always liked the flowers.""Bernice Brown, wife of Gov. Edmund G. ""Pat"" Brown and Jerry's mom, was among many prominent supporters of the show celebrating Sacramento's official flower. Other California first ladies also participated in opening ceremonies and show-related events.""We are the Camellia Capital,"" said Schanz. ""People don't forget.""Revered for their winter beauty, camellias still live up to this year's show theme: ""Flower Power.""""We look at the camellias as a flower that brings so many people together,"" Schanz said. ""It has the power of attention.""They have a huge amount of history in Sacramento,"" she added. ""We're the oldest camellia show in the U.S.  89 years! That's quite remarkable. We're also one of the largest shows in the nation.""Camellias have flourished in Sacramento since the 1850s. By the 1920s, Sacramento had earned the nickname ""Camellia City of the World."" Scores of heritage bushes and trees  some dating back almost a century  still dot the gardens of downtown homes and landmarks.""We actually have some of the best camellias in the nation,"" Schanz said. ""In the Southeast, their season is already over. We get visitors from other states and they're amazed by our flowers.""Home to many decades-old camellias, the Capitol continued to do its part with Camellia Day on Thursday. Volunteers from the California State Capitol Museum distributed hundreds of handmade corsages made from heritage camellias grown on the Capitol grounds.Dedicated in 1953 as a living memorial, Capitol Park's Pioneer Camellia Grove still boasts 183 bushes, many no longer available commercially. More than 800 camellia bushes are scattered throughout Capitol Park.As part of another long tradition, the show will offer its official button for sale today and Sunday. For the second consecutive year, local artist Joanne Tsukamoto created the winning design, chosen from dozens of entries.""We've been selling buttons since 1964,"" said Schanz, noting the proceeds help pay for the auditorium's rental. ""The price is still $1. That's got to be a record for lack of inflation.""Besides table after table of exhibition blooms, the show features arrangements made with camellias and a photo contest. The society also will sell about 200 plants, many unavailable at local nurseries.On Sunday, artists will paint camellia-related scenes or still lifes and offer their work for sale.This winter's wacky weather has been a little rough on these February flowers.""It's been a little more challenging season because of the cold weather,"" Schanz said. ""The blooms have not been opening up like they should.""This week's sunny days came just in time.""We'll have lots of beautiful flowers,"" she added. ""With warmer weather this week, the show should be just spectacular.""89th ANNUAL SACRAMENTO CAMELLIA SHOW AND SALEWhere: Memorial Auditorium, 1515 J St., SacramentoWhen: 3-6 p.m. today, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. SundayAdmission: FreeDetails: www.camelliasocietyofsacramento.orgEntries: The public is invited to enter cut camellia blooms from 7 to 10:30 a.m. today.

V"Through triumph, turmoil and relocation talks, Jerry Reynolds remains one of the most beloved members of the Kings organization. In his 28th season with the NBA team, the former coach and general manager now serves as director of player personnel and broadcaster.When he's not on television or courtside, Reynolds spends most of his time in his Roseville home. It has everything he needs: a treadmill, a TV and a comfortable recliner.""It's the secret to a long and happy marriage,"" Reynolds quipped.Over their almost three decades in Sacramento, Jerry and Dodie Reynolds have thought about moving. But they stay in the same Roseville house they bought new almost 24 years ago. Jerry, 69, still mows his own lawn. Dodie works in her garden.Dodie gets credit for finding the 3,000-square-foot, four-bedroom ranch house, tucked into a quiet cul de sac. With comfortable furnishings, tile floors and lots of golden oak, the modest home remains understated  just like Jerry.""When I went house-hunting, Jerry said it had to be 15 minutes from the arena,"" she recalled. ""And it was 15 minutes  at 10 in the morning.""These days, Reynolds' commute to Sleep Train Arena takes considerably longer, but the couple love their quiet neighborhood.A do-it-yourselfer, Dodie has remodeled both bathrooms and the kitchen, which opens into the spacious family room  her favorite part of the house. She's now updating the oak kitchen again with new paint and blinds.This winter, Dodie tore out a backyard deck to make room for terraced planters next to their lap pool. She also created a four-level water feature from flagstone.""I used to do everything myself, but now I know when to bring in some expert help,"" said Dodie, a retired teacher. ""I try to get projects done while Jerry is on the road.""Said Jerry, ""I know when to stay out of the way.""During various projects, many mementos from Reynolds' long career have been tucked away in large oak cabinets in the living room, den and man cave.""Over the years, you accumulate a lot of stuff,"" said Reynolds. ""I don't particularly have a favorite 'thing.' What I value most are the memories, the people; that's what sticks with you.""Photos of basketball colleagues dot the walls of the family room and hall. In one frame, Reynolds and then-coach Bill Russell laugh together before a Kings game. Near the den's fireplace is a shot of good friend and NBA legend Larry Bird, standing next to the fireplace with Reynolds  the second most famous product of French Lick, Ind.Willis Reed and other NBA greats peer out from other photos, bringing back fond memories.Married for 45 years, Jerry and Dodie Reynolds came to Sacramento with the Kings from Kansas City in 1985. At that time, Jerry was an assistant coach. If the Kings leave for Seattle, they won't be moving again.""This is our home,"" Jerry said. ""I try not to think about it. I've been blessed to be part of this great community for 28 years. I'm staying."""\u000a

V"The Sacramento Bee hosts a network of high-quality news providers and bloggers in the Sacramento region. Here is a sampling of the best of the current Home & Garden blogs. Check out the full postings: sacramentoconnect.sacbee.com Sacramento radio host ""Farmer Fred"" Hoffman, author of ""The Farmer Fred Rant,"" discusses how ""season creep"" is confusing plants in our gardens as well as challenging farmers and nature:""Should gardeners be concerned about global warming? Politics aside, climate change is already manifesting itself in our yards. The Climate Nexus think tank explains that what we are seeing is called 'season creep'; winters are shorter and milder, causing some plants to bloom earlier than we would normally expect. For example, many area fruit and nut trees were ahead of their typical blooming curve, sending out blossoms in an atypically warmer early February before gardeners were ready to apply their last round of dormant spray. Although that is more of an inconvenience than a problem, climate change is producing other, more profound effects in our yards, according to Climate Nexus.""Read more at: http://farmerfredrant.blogspot.com"\u000a

V"I was once told of the invasion of an unwanted squirrel into my Carmichael orchard/forest. But I can't remember which  gray or red?Which squirrel should I not dispatch? And why? Marion Gribskov, CarmichaelFirst, know the difference between tree squirrels and ground squirrels.According to UC Master Gardeners Annie Kempees and Mary Griggs, four species of tree squirrels are active in California. All are classified as game mammals with the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife. None is listed as endangered in California.Douglas squirrels and Western gray squirrels are native and not considered major pests. The Douglas squirrel is also known as ""chickaree"" or ""pine squirrel.""The other two  the Eastern fox squirrel and Eastern gray squirrel  are introduced species.The Eastern fox squirrel is also known as the ""red squirrel,"" the ""fox squirrel"" and the ""red fox squirrel."" This redhead is the one considered a major pest in California.The Eastern gray squirrel is a pest for only a limited range. Originally introduced into Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, they also are established in areas of Calaveras and San Joaquin counties in California and may be expanding their range.Tree squirrels are classified as game animals, so in general, a permit is required to hunt, take or control them. However, if the Eastern fox squirrel is damaging a person's property or crops, they may control them any time and by any legal means.But if the Eastern gray squirrel is the pest, a person must still obtain a permit from Fish and Wildlife.For information on identifying which tree squirrels you are seeing in your yard, detailed information is in the ""Tree Squirrel Pest Note"" that is available online at www.ipm.ucdavis. edu. This pest note also includes extensive information on management of the squirrels using such methods as habitat modification, exclusion and trapping (when appropriate).For a hard copy of this pest note, please send a self-addressed, stamped business-size envelope to: PN 74122, UC Cooperative Extension, 4145 Branch Center Road, Sacramento, CA 95827.Ground squirrels are another matter.Although ground squirrels look similar to tree squirrels and can climb trees, when frightened they will retreat to a burrow, whereas tree squirrels will climb a tree or tall structure and not use a burrow.Tree squirrels are distinguished from ground squirrels by their long bushy tails and lack of flecklike spots or stripes. Ground squirrels can create havoc by digging lots of holes.If ground squirrels are a problem in your yard, additional information on their control can be found in the ""Ground Squirrel Pest Note"" at www.ipm.ucdavis.edu. For a copy of this pest note, please send a self-addressed, stamped business-size envelope requesting PN 7438 at the above address.GARDEN QUESTIONS?Questions are answered by master gardeners at the UC Cooperative Extension services in Sacramento and Placer counties.Send questions to Garden Detective, P.O.

V"DEAR HELOISE: Is there a difference between liquid and dry measuring cups? I know there are cups made for wet ingredients and ones for dry ingredients, but does it really matter which one I use? Linda W. In IndianaDEAR LINDA: A cup is a cup by liquid or dry ""volume."" A liquid measuring cup typically is glass or plastic so you can see through it, and the measurements are inscribed on the side. It has a spout with a handle on the side for pouring. A 1- or 2-cup probably is the most-used cup in American homes. I have three: two 2-cup ones and one 1-cup one, and two sets of dry- measuring cups.Dry measuring cups may be made of plastic or metal and have a flat top. These usually come in sets starting with 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup and up to 1 cup. Most are attached by a ring. They are designed to be filled with dry ingredients and leveled off with a knife or spatula.However, it may matter which one you use, particularly when baking. Most baking uses measurements that are precise, and it is difficult to measure dry ingredients accurately in a liquid 1- or 2-cup measuring cup.DEAR HELOISE: I am a butter lover. Knowing when to take the butter out of the refrigerator so it will be spreadable is something I have never been able to master. Softening it in the microwave oven doesn't work for me, either.I use my cheese slicer for my butter. This slicer is the planer or server type, not the wire type. It will slide across the top of the stick of butter and produce long, thin sections that melt quickly and evenly for my toast, pancakes and waffles.I use what is left over for cooking. Susan R. In VirginiaDEAR HELOISE: I always have green olives in my refrigerator. I use my melon baller, which has a small hole in the center, to get the olives out of the jar. I can do this without contaminating the brine. I also am able to drain the brine that comes out because of the small hole, leaving me with just the olives, and no messy liquid everywhere. Diane J., Via EmailDEAR HELOISE: When I make bread recipes calling for 3 tablespoons of honey or molasses, I find it exasperating to wait for the first tablespoon to drain so I can add the next. If the recipe also calls for oil, I add the oil first, then measure the sweetener using the now-oil-coated spoon. It pours out in a flash. Mary D. In VirginiaDEAR HELOISE: I read your hints often, and I have something to share with your readers. I use oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs when I make meatloaf or salmon patties. It works well, I don't even taste the oatmeal and it's healthy. E.S. In Louisiana"\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/09/5176915/at-bail-hearing-prosecutors-detail.html,"Prosecutors on Friday said investigators found explosive materials, including nitroglycerine, in UC Davis chemistry researcher David Snyder's blast-damaged apartment  and said he had been warned in the past not to make explosives at his university's labs.""He already knew it was against the law,"" said Martha Holzapfel, Yolo County deputy district attorney.Ultimately, she said, Snyder ""did something so dangerous, even he couldn't control it. This is what he likes to do and he's not going to stop just because you told him, 'No.' ""Snyder, 32, pleaded not guilty at his Friday bail hearing in Yolo Superior Court. He remains held in lieu of $2 million bail at Yolo County jail on 17 explosives and firearms-related charges connected to the early morning blast Jan. 17 at his Russell Park apartment in Davis.Prosecutors added seven firearms counts in an amended complaint against the chemist, one each for weapons investigators recovered from the apartment, along with what Holzapfel said were ""multiple boxes of ammunition.""Yolo Superior Court Judge David Reed denied Snyder defense attorney Linda Parisi's request to lower Snyder's bail to $500,000, saying his alleged actions put friends, neighbors, colleagues and first responders at risk.Three weeks after the blast, Snyder sat quietly in the jury booth, his damaged left hand in a substantially smaller wrap than at his first court appearance. Snyder listened as Parisi described him as an inquisitive tinkerer and hard-working chemist involved in an unfortunate accident. Though Snyder has family in Texas and Colorado and his stint at UC Davis was to end in January, Parisi insisted the Davis man was neither a flight risk nor a threat to the community.""There's nothing to suggest animosity or ill will"" toward the university, Parisi said, calling Snyder a ""prolific worker"" at laboratories at UC Davis.Snyder, who earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from UC Davis in 2004 and completed doctoral studies in 2011, was a junior specialist at UC Davis on a two-month contract, said campus officials.Yolo prosecutors quickly sketched out their own portrayal of Snyder as a man with a dangerous penchant for making and detonating explosives.In Snyder's apartment, prosecutors allege he had several common explosives: a vial of triacetone-triperoxide, known by its initials TATP; hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, or HMTD; and RDX.Also known as cyclonite, the powerful RDX is a primary ingredient in military C-4 explosives and in blasting caps. Holzapfel said Snyder remains a danger to the community, citing the explosives, his refusal to talk to authorities who responded to the scene and a call prosecutors say a blast-injured Snyder made to a friend allegedly telling him to dispose of the materials in city and campus trash containers.Authorities later questioned the unidentified friend. Prosecutors say the person is connected to UC Davis but is not a faculty member.Parisi downplayed prosecutors' explosives claims following the hearing, saying the materials were in ""very small amounts"" that would require ""some force to detonate.""UC Davis officials declined to comment on Friday's hearing, but said campus administrators in 2011 had received a complaint stemming from a 2009 incident in which Snyder and a classmate allegedly made small firecrackers in a chemistry department lab.The complaint was reviewed and the case closed, university officials said.Meanwhile, UC Davis police continue to stress that they had ""no evidence to suggest Snyder had broader plans.""Snyder is scheduled to return March 14 to Yolo Superior Court for a prehearing conference."\u000a

McGee is 84. Despite the fact that they're a few decades older than most first-time half-marathoners, they don't really know why people are making a fuss about them.""We're just walking,"" said McGee, a retired Sacramento teacher. ""I've never trained, and I'm not training now. I'm offended by that. For 30 years, I've exercised.""The Running of the Elk half-marathon in Elk Grove on Sunday will provide a lot of exercise for both women. The plan is for them to be a relay team, with Baker walking the first 7.5 miles, while McGee finishes up the remaining distance  about 5.5 miles.While running a marathon might be a more impressive feat, as would walking the entire half-marathon distance, it remains inspiring when fit and healthy older adults pair up to complete a distance event.They do not shuffle their feet, these two.""The people who start to shuffle tend to be the ones who sit all day and watch TV,"" said Minette Harper, who manages the retirement community with her husband, David. ""You see it all the time. If you don't use it, you lose it.""I think Helen and Phyllis have approached being seniors in the best way possible. The more active you are, the healthier you are, not just physically but also mentally and emotionally.""Years ago, before she and her husband, Tom, bought their first treadmill, she was overweight, McGee said. Exercise helped her slowly lose pounds and keep them off.Now the McGees are on their fourth treadmill, which she cranks up to a steep angle and walks on for an hour every weekday.""For me, it's just a lifestyle,"" she said.Similarly, Baker said she was frequently ill when she was younger, and exercise helped her keep going.""I always had a garden, and I went out and did a lot of hoeing and picking and all that,"" said Baker, a widow and retired Sacramento school employee. ""I've always done a lot of walking, and I haven't stopped.""She walks for an hour or two several times each week along the streets near the seniors residence. And she likes to say that her walking shoes bear the dust of the four continents where she's traveled.Her leg of Sunday's half-marathon ends in front of the dairy farm where she was raised  now a suburban street near Franklin High School.A Camden Springs staff member plans to walk alongside Baker during the event, and McGee's daughter plans to walk with her.""It's a challenge for both of them,"" said Harper.

V"Average home prices in the Sacramento metro area rose 6.1 percent last year, but they'll decline 5.4 percent by this fall, according to Brookfield, Wis.-based Fiserv Inc., a global technology provider serving the financial services industry.The Fiserv Case-Shiller Indexes, which track home-price trends in more than 380 U.S. metro markets, said Sacramento-area prices will then see a 10.4 percent growth spurt between this year's third quarter and the third quarter of 2014.The marginal home-price downturn projected by Fiserv this year is counter to projections made by other residential real estate analysts who cite high demand and low home inventory throughout the region.Fiserv projections are based, in part, on Federal Housing Finance Agency data.Nationally, Fiserv projects home prices will increase 0.6 percent from last year's third quarter to this year's third quarter.

V"When top-ranked Sheldon played St. Augustine Catholic of San Diego on Saturday for the championship of the Torrey Pines Holiday Classic, not everyone was there to see the local upstarts or their star player, UC Davis-bound Brynton Lemar.St. Augustine had upset nationally ranked Salesian of Richmond 56-42 in a semifinal the night before and was the first San Diego-area team to reach the top-tier National Division title game since 2004.Many in the crowd, clad in the red-and-black colors of San Diego State, were there to watch Sheldon's senior duo of Dakarai Allen and D'Erryl Williams.The 6-foot-6 Allen and 6-4 Williams have signed national letters of intent with the Aztecs, who already have a Sacramento-area connection with former prep stars Chase Tapley (Sacramento) and Xavier Thames (Pleasant Grove) now helping to lead the nationally ranked team.Allen and Williams didn't disappoint the Aztecs faithful or coach Steve Fisher, who was also in attendance, as they helped key the Huskies' 64-47 victory over the Saints to complete a four-game sweep in the tournament.Allen earned National Division MVP in finishing with 21 points and dominating in all facets. Williams, who missed Sheldon's first six games and is still recovering from a nagging ankle injury, scored nine points and made all-tournament.Both overcame a head-to-head collision with each other in the first quarter that left Allen bloodied, bandaged but not undaunted.Freshman Devin Greene scored 12 points and senior Jalen Hicks, another Husky battling back from an ankle injury, also played well as Sheldon rebounded from a disappointing 2-2 finish in the Jerry Tarkanian Classic in Las Vegas the week before.In Torrey Pines, Sheldon beat Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Montebello 72-39, Mundelein of Illinois 82-68 and, in a semifinal, Windward of Los Angeles 60-50, behind Ryan Manning's 20 points and Williams' 12.Next up for Sheldon is the All-State Sugar Bowl Classic Thursday through Saturday in New Orleans.Antelope tested  Despite winning only once in four games at the Maxpreps Holiday Classic in Palm Springs, Antelope competed well against several top out-of-state programs.The Titans fell 55-50 to USA Today's national No. 16 Fort Bend Travis of Richmond, Texas, and its Kentucky-bound senior twins Aaron and Andrew Harrison; lost to Minnesota-bound Alvin Ellis and Chicago power De La Salle 61-57 and dropped a 74-70 decision to Rainier Beach of Seattle, the defending 3-A Washington state champions.Antelope opened the tournament with a 74-71 win over Bellevue, Wash.Titans senior forward Gabe Bealer scored 95 points in the four games.Cougars win in Auburn  Credit team chemistry, stellar fundamentals and depth for No. 9 Del Campo's nine-game winning streak, capped Saturday with a 78-66 win over host Placer in the championship game of the Kendall Arnett Tournament.Del Campo jumped to a 16-2 lead, then made 22 of 24 free throws to keep the Hillmen at bay. Tournament MVP Vasilije Saraba, a 6-3 junior wing, led the way with 35 points. He made 17 of 18 free throws.Saraba scored 19 points in a 67-57 win over Woodcreek in a semifinal and 33 points in the Cougars' 70-67 win against Colfax in the opener.But Saraba wasn't the tournament's leading scorer.

V"Floyd ""J.R."" Rothenberger made the agonizing decision to close two of his three J.R.'s Texas Bar-B-Que restaurants over the weekend, but he vowed Monday to ""fight on until I don't have any more breath.""With his business facing debt, declining revenue and rising costs amid what he calls a sluggish economy, Rothenberger on Saturday pulled the plug on his restaurants at 3445 El Camino Ave., and 232 Jibboom St. (near Interstate 5 and Richards Boulevard).The J.R.'s Texas Bar-B-Que at 180 Otto Circle  the original J.R.'s restaurant that opened 25 years ago featuring mesquite-smoked, Texas-style barbecue  remains open.Ominously, that restaurant is near the Campbell Soup Co. plant scheduled to fade to black this summer after gradually shedding 700 blue-collar jobs.Even so, a feisty Rothenberger said Monday that he was determined to stay in the game.""I'm going to fight it out. I'm going to go down swinging,"" he said. ""I was down $1 million in 1982 and I eventually paid everybody back. I still can't figure out what the word 'quit' means.""I'm going to be the best I can be.  I want the community to know that I don't want to go anywhere.""And besides, Rothenberger added with a chuckle, ""I can't go anywhere because my brisket is too good.""The financial alarm bells went off in early January, when local TV stations reported that Rothenberger's three restaurants would likely close within days.At that time, Rothenberger complained that annual sales were down about 50 percent from a previous peak of around $1.1 million.The news reports prompted a flood of customers to the Otto Circle restaurant, and Rothenberger said he received a $20,000 personal loan ""from a friend.""For a while, that was enough to keep orders of smoked brisket, pork and beef ribs, pork shoulder, chicken, turkey and hot links on the tables.While Rothenberger said he was touched by the customer response, he said it tailed off after about two weeks. His fiscal situation had not improved enough to enable him to carry on with three establishments.""So, I've come back to Otto Circle,"" he said. ""I just got $8,000 in catering, so maybe that's a sign.""The closing of two J.R.'s restaurants resulted in the loss of seven jobs. Five people remain to staff the J.R.'s restaurant at Otto Circle.Rothenberger added that while the city of Sacramento is concentrating on keeping the Kings, he believes it's not paying enough attention to keeping small businesses.

V"Ross Hammond the musician has a lot in common with Ross Hammond the music festival curator. Both are creative entrepreneurs who understand the importance of timing, patience and knowing when to make something happen.Hammond identifies himself primarily as a jazz musician, which covers a lot of territory these days. Hammond's In the Flow Festival similarly takes in a wide range of improvisation and groove-based performance. Hammond started the midtown event in 2008, feeling progressive music needed celebrating in Sacramento, and he's consistently grown and developed the idea. This year's In the Flow features six days and nights of performances across five venues from Wednesday through May 14.""As a musical experience it's grown every year, and word of mouth has just continually built it up,"" Hammond said. The festival incorporates jazz and improvised music from artists up and down the West Coast from Los Angeles to Seattle, with a strong Bay Area contingent and musicians from the foothills. Hammond himself selects and books all the performers, many of whom have come through his long- running series at Luna's called Nebraska Mondays.Inquiries from groups looking to play the festival have multiplied each year since Hammond inaugurated the spring event.""I started getting email from people looking to get booked into the festival as far back as the fall,"" Hammond said.""These are bands I haven't heard of, or bands that are new, and it makes me feel like the word's getting out about us a lot more."" This year's festival moves from Bay Area legends Broun Fellinis to the fresh-faced Sacramento band Cave Women. As much as the festival is based in improvisation, modern bands resist genres and categories, so the music might move from what sounds like chamber jazz to thrash punk. While much of the material is original, composers from Duke Ellington to P.J. Harvey could be represented.There's broad-based institutional support from organizations including the Midtown Business Association as well as more likely suspects such as the hipster free music newspaper Submerge. ""Now we have more local businesses who want to help sponsor us or be partners,"" Hammond said.""It's just easier now to get people on board, and you really need that.""Hammond will have In the Flow events at five venues this year  Antiquit Maison Privee, Luna's Cafe and Phono Select Records, which hosted events last year, along with Bows & Arrows and the Sacramento Poetry Center at California Stage, which both are new to the festival. ""We've always had poetry, but this is the first time it'll be at a poetry venue. It'll be a poetry-and-music marriage night,"" Hammond said.""Bows & Arrows draws a different crowd than some of these other places do, so it'll be great to mix it up a little bit. To survive, you need to spread your audience around.""Hammond can see the day when he celebrates 20 years of In the Flow Festivals as he continues growing the event.""It feels like we've taken this grass-roots approach and built it up very organically by musicians, for musicians, very DIY. It's still true to that."""\u000a

V"Ever since the April 20 Gulf of Mexico Macondo oil well blowout and Deepwater Horizon rig explosion, which killed 11 men, the three mega corporations involved have stood in a triangle pointing fingers at each other.Now, the presidential commission investigating the disaster, which led to the largest oil spill in the nation's history, says they're right, in a way: All three are to blame -- as are government regulators.More ominously, the panel, co-chaired by Florida's former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham and former EPA administrator William K. Reilly, warns that another such spill could happen today. The Obama administration must tighten oversight of offshore drilling to make sure it doesn't.Only one chapter of the commission's full report, due out next week, has been released, but it's an important one because it deals with the blowout's causes. British Petroleum, major owner of the well, Halliburton, which was pumping cement into the well when it blew, and Transocean, the drilling contractor, all took shortcuts to save time and money when less risky options were possible, the commission says.Those shortcuts, plus a failure of the three companies and their subcontractors to communicate with each other better, caused the well eruption, rig explosion and subsequent spill of nearly five million barrels of oil into the Gulf.``Better management by BP, Halliburton and Transocean would almost certainly have prevented the blowout by improving the ability of individuals involved to identify the risks they faced, and to properly evaluate, communicate and address them. A blowout in deep water was not a statistical inevitability,'' says the report. To read the complete editorial, visit www.miamiherald.com."\u000a

""But I think it's in the top two.""That likely impacted the no-show rate for marathon-ers. Of the 9,300 people who registered, 6,474 started the race and 6,185 crossed the finish line, officials said.There were 809 relay teams that finished and 2,000 joined in the 2.62-mile fun run.A race spokesman said the marathon finishers included all dozen men who had run the first 29 CIMs.""My goal was to not have to walk,"" said John O'Neill, 71, of Diamond Springs, the oldest of the group who finished in 4:22:22 and said it didn't come to that.

The 10-year-old's entry, ""Surgeo,"" beat ""Stitch"" and about 250 other submissions from elementary school students in the Buckeye Union, Folsom Cordova and Rescue Unified school districts, hospital President Michael Ricks said.""It just makes sense,"" said Hunter, who attends Oak Meadow Elementary School in El Dorado Hills, with a shrug.He wore a surgical cap and sky-blue nurse scrubs over his clothes and challenged Ricks to beat his score on the robot training software.""He's definitely competitive like surgeons are,"" said Dr. Tim Phelan, an OB/GYN at Mercy Hospital.Phelan, who said he uses the new robot for hysterectomies, said he was the first Mercy Hospital of Folsom doctor to operate with the machine after the hospital bought it for more than $1 million in June. ""Surgeo"" has been used in 126 operations since, Ricks said.""The equipment allows us to do more complicated surgeries in a less-invasive way,"" said Phelan.He said he trained on pigs before performing his first procedure on a patient.He said many of his patients are intrigued when they learn a robot will help perform their surgery.Surgeons use stirrups around their thumbs and forefingers and foot pedals from a console to operate the three robotic arms on ""Surgeo,"" produced by Intuitive Surgical, Inc.""The biggest change for the surgeon is to be stepping away from the patient's bedside and do surgery,"" Phelan said.He said the technology helps him make more precise, smaller cuts that allow patients to go home sooner.Mercy Hospital also awarded Oak Meadow Elementary School $500 as part of its student's prize.

V"The man already accused of inflicting corporal punishment on students at his Roseville basketball academy was arrested again Wednesday on seven felony counts related to financial transgressions. Francis Amiteye Ngissah, 24, was first arrested Jan. 8 after four students of his CCSE Preparatory Academy told the Roseville Police Department that they had been forced to stand in a corner, restrained with zip ties and sometimes had clothespins clamped on their nipples as punishment. He was arrested again on Feb. 13 on forgery and fraud charges for allegedly buying furniture with bad checks.Wednesday's arrest stemmed from three additional fraud cases, authorities said.Ngissah is suspected of paying two Roseville businesses for auto parts and groceries with checks from closed accounts.He also is suspected of signing over the deed to the home he was renting as collateral to a bail bondsman, said Dee Dee Gunther, a spokeswoman for the department. The home's owner, Steve Putnam, said he is in the process of evicting Ngissah and said he is owed $21,000 in back rent. Earlier this month police were called to the home Ngissah rents from Putnam after there was a disturbance when the landlord tried to enter the residence. At that time, Putnam displayed copies of bad checks he said were written to him by Ngissah.""This guy is just one thing after the other,"" Putnam said. He said it has been a struggle to get the rent from Ngissah from the beginning of their relationship. Ngissah was arrested at the rental home Wednesday without incident and booked into the Roseville city jail. The charges include two counts of forgery, two counts of burglary (entering a business with the intent to commit fraud), theft and other related charges. He is being held in lieu of $55,000 bail. The CCSE academy opened in summer 2012, with several international students arriving, but the reality never matched the glossy dreams promised on the school's website. For tuition of $10,000  plus another $5,000 for live-in students  the school said it would help student athletes get accepted into elite college basketball programs.Students lived and were taught in the six-bedroom home rented from Putnam and practiced basketball at a local gym.The athletes did not play against other area high schools but were scheduled to play games and in tournaments against other specialized basketball schools throughout the country.Only a handful of games were played before the team's coach quit, saying he hadn't been paid. The school was closed after Ngissah was arrested in January. Even after all of the students were gone and an eviction loomed, Ngissah remained in the six-bedroom home.Ngissah made at least one earlier attempt to start a school, submitting an application to the Robla School District in 2011 to create a ""sports and entertainment academy."" Robla Superintendent Ruben Reyes said the district board had some serious problems with the plan and rejected it.According to information on the Robla application submitted by Ngissah, he started a company at age 16, patented an invention while in high school and was a freshman on a U.S. champion Academic Decathlon team.After his clash with Putnam earlier this month, Ngissah declined a request for an interview, referring calls to his media department. It's unclear whether one exists.Wednesday night, Ngissah remained in jail in Roseville."\u000a

V"It seems only fitting that Matt Contreras knows what happened to one of Bella Vista High School's original soccer goal posts after a new field was built at the Fair Oaks school several years back.""I planted it in my back yard,"" Contreras said. ""Whenever my kids looked out the window, I wanted them to see a soccer net.""  I tell my wife (Diane) all the time that she married a soccer ball. It's my passion.""Matt is the elder statesman of Bella Vista's first family of soccer.Contreras, 51, played on Bella Vista's first boys soccer league championship team in 1978. After starring at Cosumnes River College and Sacramento State, he became the Broncos' boys coach at age 24 in 1984. In his 12 seasons, Bella Vista lost three times in Sac-Joaquin Section championship matches.Matt now assists younger brother, Zack, 47, on Bella Vista's defending section Division II championship team, which is undefeated this season.Zack also is a former Bella Vista standout (he played on the Broncos' first section runner-up team in 1981) who played at Pacific, moved to North Carolina briefly and lived for 13 years in Rohnert Park before returning to Sacramento in 2001.Matt and Zack have coached sons at Bella Vista.Matt's son Anthony, who played on the brothers' first section championship team in 2008 and was an all-Capital Valley Conference MVP, is a starting sophomore defender at Claremont-Mudd-Scripps College in Southern California. Daughter Melina played for Bella Vista's girls team nearly a decade ago.Zack's oldest son, Zack Jr., who played goalie on their D-III section runner-up teams in 2006 and 2007, played at Whitworth University in Spokane, Wash., and Zack Sr.'s youngest son, Jackson, is a star freshman center back on the Broncos' 16-1 JV team.When Zack was offered the freshman boys job at Bella Vista in 2004, he agreed, so long as he could bring along his brother. They had never coached together.""It's really fun coaching with my brother,"" said Zack, a pharmacist. ""Our personalities mesh so well. The boys really respond to Matt. His heart, passion and personality come out in the game.""I'm more serious. I push and push and hammer away to keep them in line, to keep them focused. I'm the worrier.""In playing for four years for the brothers, senior center back Preston Davis said their personalities are like night and day.""Matt's funny, Zack's a lot more serious,"" said Davis, who will play at Sacramento State next fall. ""But over the four years, they've been really consistent in their coaching. They're both great coaches.""Senior forward Tyler Miguel, Bella Vista's other four-year player, says what makes the brothers unique from other coaches he has had through the years is their attention to the mental aspects of the game. Each season, players receive a written handout titled ""Developing a Winning Attitude.""""It's one page  front and back  but it's pretty detailed,"" Miguel said. ""It talks about food, rest, mental thoughts. It emphasizes having a 'big dog attitude'  that you come into a match knowing you are going to win.""Bella Vista has been a perennial boys soccer power, collecting three section titles and seven runner-up finishes. Since the Contreras brothers took over the varsity team six seasons ago, Bella Vista has reached the section final five times and is on the precipice of emerging from the shadows cast by nationally recognized programs Jesuit, Davis and Granite Bay.This week, Bella Vista debuted in the Region VIII poll at No. 13. The poll ranks high school teams from across the Western United States. Jesuit is No. 1.Beating then-nationally ranked Granite Bay 4-1 on penalty kicks for the D-II championship last season was a huge confidence builder.Now the Broncos want more.They are 14-0-2 after beating Oakmont 7-1 Tuesday and have most of their key players back from last year's team, plus a couple of new wrinkles.Davis and Miguel are team captains along with senior midfielder Justin Childs, a three-year starter and the team's cerebral leader. Mathew Waldron, Mark Caliguire, Stefan Sarkovich and Galen Herron are other standout seniors.The team's leading scorer is senior midfielder Trevor Jackson (18 goals, nine assists), a transfer from Arizona. The goalie is 6-foot-3 freshman Drake Callendar (nine shutouts).""To get us to the next level, it would be big to go back-to-back,"" Davis said of a section title repeat.While Matt and Zack Contreras have spent most of their adult lives coaching competitive youth club soccer teams, they prefer the high school game.""Playing for your high school is like playing for your country,"" Zack Contreras said. ""There's pride and opportunity to play with your buddies from the neighborhood. And because these kids also play club, a lot of their friends are on rival teams. So there's always bragging rights.""A nursery store manager, Matt has been coaching soccer teams in one form or another since he was 15.""I love coaching high school because it's such a challenge,"" said Matt, who also is an assistant to Bella Vista girls coach Christie Wheeler. ""You bring together 24 different personalities who play in different systems and for five days a week in three months you try to get them to play as one to win a league title, a section championship."""\u000a

V"It was a source of community pride  the first candy-colored iMac computers, the ones that fueled Apple's comeback in the late 1990s, were assembled at the company's Elk Grove campus.Now, eight years after Apple Inc. stopped manufacturing in Elk Grove, city officials are wondering if a comeback is possible.Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, fueled much of the speculation on Thursday by declaring the company intends to start manufacturing Mac computers again in the United States next year.Cook told Bloomberg Businessweek magazine and NBC's ""Rock Center with Brian Williams"" that Apple expects to invest more than $100 million to resume U.S. manufacturing.His comments came several days after the website TechCrunch reported that some Macs are already undergoing final assembly in the United States. TechCrunch said a possible site is Elk Grove.""I've heard the scuttlebutt,"" said Mayor-elect Gary Davis.Before the assembly line closed in 2004, Elk Grove was Apple's last in-house manufacturing site in the United States.In recent months, Apple has come under fire because of working conditions at Foxconn, its Chinese supplier. Foxconn, which does have some operations in the United States, said Thursday it plans to expand its U.S. manufacturing.Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley consultant, said Apple must have figured out how to make computers again in the U.S. without sacrificing profit.""You don't do this just for publicity,"" said Bajarin, who runs a company called Creative Strategies.He believes a new Apple facility in Austin, Texas, could be a likely site for manufacturing.Elk Grove officials, however, are contacting Apple to see if manufacturing might return to the Laguna Boulevard campus. Davis and Randy Starbuck, the city's economic development director, haven't yet gotten any answers from the notoriously secretive company.Apple didn't respond to inquiries from The Bee.Apple employs as many as 1,800 workers in Elk Grove, mainly in customer support, marketing and distribution.The company ramped up hiring around the time the new iPhone 5 was released this fall, Starbuck said.He said the Laguna campus has undergone some renovations lately, but he believes the changes are mostly connected to improving compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act."\u000a

The quarterback-linebacker has verbally committed to Boise State.As a junior, he had 152 tackles, two sacks and an interception that he returned for a touchdown. He also combined for 1,800 passing and rushing yards with 31 touchdowns. He made first team all-Idaho on offense and defense.But his best sport may be baseball, where some experts see him as a possible first-round draft pick in June. ESPN ranks the third baseman as the No. 1 corner infielder in the high school class of 2013 and the No. 26 prospect overall.There was some question whether Martarano would be allowed to play Saturday after he reportedly threw a punch and was ejected early in Fruitland's 58-7 win over Ontario, Ore., last Friday night.The ejection was overturned on appeal (some observers reported that Martarano only reached out to push away a player who had grabbed his face mask after a play), and Casa Roble coach Norm Ryan figures that the Grizzlies wouldn't come to California without their best player.""No. 2 looks good on film,"" Ryan said. ""On one play, he cut back against the grain and outran everyone 60 yards down the sideline. My first thought, 'He's too big to do that.' ""Ryan says Fruitland runs an old-fashioned wing-T in which Martarano sometimes tosses the ball to a running back, then delivers a crushing lead block.""He's even more devastating at linebacker,"" Ryan said.It will be an interesting team matchup and one Ryan thinks will be competitive despite the enrollment ratio difference of nearly three to one between the schools.Fruitland has played in the past six 3A Idaho state championship games, winning twice, and has another Boise State commit in 6-4, 235-pound senior tight end-defensive end Alec Dhaenens.""Looking at the film, that's a football team,"" Ryan said. ""They tackle and block just like us. The only difference is they practice in the middle of a corn field. And I thought Orangevale was rural.""The 10 a.m. start was made to accommodate Fruitland's two-way players and concerns about the heat.Casa Roble, which traditionally platoons, is in a minor rebuilding mode after 38 seniors, including 19 starters, graduated from last year's 10-3 team.Casa Roble usually runs a balanced spread attack, but its biggest success this year has come with talented senior Kody Jones running behind 6-foot-5, 385-pound tackle Chris McKnight and 6-2, 270-pound guard Eddie Chastain, both seniors.Jones, the area's leading rusher, has gained 410 yards and scored two touchdowns on 34 carries through two games, a 28-20 win over Rio Americano and a 49-34 loss to Woodcreek last Friday.Although it's a nonleague game, tonight's game could be pivotal to Casa Roble's hopes of reaching the playoffs for the 10th time in Ryan's 11 seasons.Teams need at least five wins, sometimes six, to reach the postseason. Next up for the Rams are games at No. 8 Placer on Sept. 14, No. 9 Folsom on Sept. 21 and No. 13 Del Campo, the Rams' Capital Valley Conference rival, on Oct. 5.""That's our version of murderer's row, and we still have to face a CVC in which everyone appears to have improved, with the possible exception of us,"" Ryan said."\u000a

One year after crude from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion reached Floridas shores, cleanup crews are still unearthing the sticky hardened bits of oil.Theyre about the size of your finger nail, said Buck Lee, a lifelong Pensacola native and executive director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority, which oversees beach projects.While the oil rig exploded on April 20, 2010, it wasnt until June 4 of the same year that tar patties made landfall on Pensacola. The plumes of oil sheen slowly drifted across nearly 200 miles of the Panhandles beaches  from quaint beach towns like Watercolor and Seaside in Walton County to the spring-break metropolis of Panama City Beach.Though much of the goop has been skimmed from the water and plucked from the sand, the region still pays the price of one of the nations most devastating oil spills. Workers and mechanical sifting machines continue to remove unsightly tarball specs from the Panhandles pristine beaches, many business owners are still fighting to recoup lost profits from BP and the future impact on the rest of the economy and environment may take years to truly learn.For now, theres some positive news: Visitors are returning to the Panhandle beaches in record numbers and spending at hotels and storefronts that were hurting for cash last summer.What a year its been, said Lee, who spent the last year in countless conference calls and meetings with BP and federal officials.

V"Foothill's Drew Hibbs and Franklin's Jesse Formaker are two of the area's most successful boys basketball coaches.Hibbs' teams have won two CIF state titles, captured last season's Sac-Joaquin Section Division III championship and made the playoffs all 15 seasons he's coached the Mustangs.Formaker's Wildcats have won the Delta Valley Conference the last four seasons and been to every postseason since he started coaching them in 2004.But this season has been different for two coaches used to 20-plus-win seasons.The victories are fewer and the challenges greater as both their teams showed during the 11th annual Father Kelly Tribute showcase and charity benefit Saturday at Jesuit High School.The event pitted four area teams, including No. 3 Pleasant Grove and No. 12 Jesuit, against four top Bay Area programs.In the opening games, Foothill fell to Campolindo of Moraga 75-59 and Franklin lost to San Leandro 60-43.Franklin led San Leandro by four points and Foothill trailed Campolindo by one at the half before things imploded for both in the second half.So with league play beginning this week for both teams, Foothill is 5-10 and Franklin 6-9.Graduation, inexperience and inconsistency have hit both programs hard. So have changing times.""In the last three or four years, we've started to see kids moving around, and the formation of these super teams,"" Formaker said. ""So I think you're going to see more ups and downs for purely neighborhood teams like ours.""Washington scholarship signee Darin Johnson, a star last season as a junior, would have been Franklin's go-to player this season, but he transferred to top-ranked Sheldon, a state power. Formaker said he had no problem with that decision.Foothill had to drop its freshman boys program this season because of a lack of interest.""We're not going to be at a Sac High level or a Sheldon level,"" said Hibbs. ""We don't get kids wanting to come to Foothill, and I don't understand that because we've been successful.""Hibbs and Formaker still enjoy coaching, and say they are mentoring good kids with a strong desire to improve this season.""As coaches, you can't help but cheer for them,"" Formaker said.Here is a recap of Saturday's games:Deer Valley-Antioch 79, Jesuit 59  Marcus Lee, a 6-foot-10 post, put on a show of dunking, shot blocking and behind-the-back dribbling as the Wolverines (10-3) topped the Marauders (8-8). Lee and guard Kendall Smith each scored 21 points. Sophomore Isiah Bailey topped Jesuit with 16.No. 3 Pleasant Grove 64, Newark-Memorial 57  Down 53-48 with 3:37 left, the Eagles (12-3) outscored the Cougars (6-6) 16-4. Captains Malik Thames (22 points), Matt Hayes (20) and Cole Nordquist (19) scored all but three of the Eagles' points.Campolindo-Moraga 75, Foothill 59  Sophomores Chris Hansen and Matt O'Reilly combined for 40 points to lead the Cougars. Douglas James topped the Mustangs with 15 points.San Leandro 60, Franklin 43  The Pirates unleashed six second-half three-pointers to overcome a four-point halftime deficit. San Leandro's Kennon Noble scored 24 points, including five threes. Marvin Timothy led Franklin with 12 points."\u000a

V"ALBANY  A favorable new trend of late among high school boys basketball heavies is to actually meet on the court and decide things fair and square.That has become increasingly more significant this season with the introduction of the CIF Open Division playoffs in March, after the state's 10 sections complete their tournaments. The Open playoffs will pit the best against the best.Saturday in the East Bay, MaxPreps Northern California No. 1 Salesian of Richmond held off Bee No. 1 and NorCal No. 3 Sheldon 69-60 in a game dripping of Open rematch intrigue.The only downer here  both teams and a full crowd at Albany High School agreed  was the three-man officiating crew that has become something of the norm for big prep showdowns. With an extra man in stripes comes an extra flurry of calls. Both coaches bemoaned the officiating and the 44 total calls.But make no mistake. Nationally recognized Salesian (21-3) is the real deal, every bit as good as advertised with superb ball handlers, team defense and an over-the-top talent in guard Jabari Bird.The 6-foot-6 Bird, headed to Cal, had 22 points and eight rebounds. He was shut out in the first quarter, thanks to strong defense by Darin Johnson, but he broke free. Bird soared for three dunks and showed his overall game by snatching two offensive rebounds for late putbacks to provide ample breathing room for Salesian.Bird's first putback and three-point play gave the Pride a 58-53 lead with 3:04 to play, and his long offensive rebound and fadeaway put his team in front 60-53 as Salesian gave the Huskies (18-5) just their second in-state loss this season.The other setback was in December to NorCal No. 2 Mitty of San Jose, a team that was later beaten by Salesian.Salesian and Sheldon expect to see each other again.Both teams have a regular season to finish, and to qualify for the prestigious Open, they must be repeat section champions. Sheldon seeks a Sac-Joaquin Section record four-peat in Division I, and the Huskies still have to clear rival and Bee No. 2 Pleasant Grove in the expected Delta River League championship later this month.Salesian is 90-7 the last three seasons in playing a national schedule.""If we win our section, we may get a No. 2 or 3 seed behind Salesian,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said. ""We'll probably see them again. This will fire us up. We didn't play well. But for as bad as we played, and for it to be a seven-point game ""We'd rather lose now than later. We'll learn from this.""Sheldon was out of sorts in the first half in being held to a season-low 21 points at the break.Fast-break passes just missed. Three-point shots rimmed out. Free throws hit the front of the rim.Sheldon played tired, but Salesian also wears out teams with its defense.Guard Markel Leonard scored 14 points for Salesian.Dakarai Allen led Sheldon with 16 points and six rebounds before fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Johnson scored 14 points and Antonio Lewis 11.D'Erryl Williams scored eight points for Sheldon, including a three-pointer to get his team within 64-57 with 50.1 seconds left. A Lewis three cut the lead to 67-60."\u000a

V"Running and eggnog, both quite enjoyable when experienced separately, can lead to queasy and potentially propulsive results when combined.But that's the fun of it, apparently. The act of chugging the rich and viscid yuletide liquid and then running as fast as you can, then chugging and running some more until you've either completed a mile around the track or your digestive tract completely rebels, has become something of a tradition for a loosely affiliated group of friends, friends of friends and even some brave strangers.For the fifth straight year, current and former prep and college cross country runners with a taste for adventure will meet Saturday morning at the American River College track to partake in the Sacramento Eggnog Mile. Conceived on a whim by two high school runners from Elk Grove who are now finishing up college, this holiday ritual has grown from 25 the first year to nearly 100. What began as a single race for a bunch of skinny guys now has grown to multiple heats and registration at http://active.com. It's drawn interlopers from the Bay Area and even farther south, as well as the occasional elderly (that's over 40) participant.The modest success of the Eggnog Mile is as surprising as it is heartening to organizers Ryan Freitas, 22, and Spencer Christy, 21. It also could be considered a testament to the power of the Internet  in this case, a message board  to unite people for a common purpose in, you know, the actual flesh. ""Ryan and I back in 2007 were talking that we should do something, a capstone for the end of the year for cross country, maybe like how some people do beer miles,"" said Christy, a senior at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. ""We figured cross country ends in the winter, and it's the holiday season. What would be a ridiculous thing to do? Why not eggnog? It's a difficult thing to drink and it's holiday themed. We threw the idea out there to everyone else and before we knew it, it was happening.""What exactly happens on ""race"" day is either wildly hilarious or really gross, depending on one's sensibilities. Put another way, if you chortle at Judd Apatow movies, you'll be way into the Eggnog Mile. The rules are simple, the task anything but: Each runner must drink a 12-ounce cup of eggnog at the starter's gun, then take off on the first of four laps that add up to a mile. After laps one, two and three, runners must stop and drink another 12-ounce cup before resuming. Anyone who vomits during the race is penalized by having to run a fifth lap (mercifully without having to down yet another cup on nog).These are guys, so they aren't predisposed to introspection. Still, when asked to reflect on why the Eggnog Mile has become so popular and why they're willing to spend big bucks on cartons of eggnog, they say it's for the camaraderie.""That first year, it was so fun, I decided immediately that I want to do this forever,"" Christy said. ""Every winter, I look forward to it even though I have school and finals at the same time I'm getting things together for the Eggnog Mile.""Added Freitas: ""People are expecting it now. It's like, we get together every year.""But such fellow-feeling is good only up to a point. The young men and women want to win. Which leads them to push their cardiovascular and digestive systems to the max. Which occasionally leads them to bending over, hands on knees, their abdominal muscles contracting and  you know the rest. Those with a strong constitution can check out a video of last year's elite race on YouTube (www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsK1o0BpZPU). Even those participants who can keep the nog down finish the race looking peaked and nauseated and with a globs of off-white drink running down their singlets to their aptly named bib numbers.""Less than half the people vomit during the race,"" Christy said. ""After  ""Freitas said the key to success is a cast-iron stomach more than great endurance. In the four previous years, he's seen celebrated prep and college runners humbled by failure of the small intestines to accept one more drop of eggnog.""We had a guy a few years ago who threw up 10 feet before the finish line, and he would've been in the top three. It was the most sad thing I've ever seen. But it was good for me because I was behind him.""Freitas' personal best is 5 minutes, 36 seconds  32 seconds behind record-holder Nate Beach, a junior on Cal's cross country team and a former all-state prep runner from the East Bay. Those times might seem slow to some, but, remember, eggnog is the great equalizer.""What happens is this: After you drink the first cup and run the first lap, you're absolutely fine,"" Freitas said. ""There's no issue. But once you finish that second lap, that's when you start breathing heavily and it starts to take a toll on your body. You realize that eggnog is not water.""This year, Freitas is ready for a personal record. ""I've been practicing,"" he said. "" I've bought four cartons of eggnog and just been pounding them as quickly as I can swallow it  and keep it down.""EGGNOG MILETo sign up for the fifth Sacramento Eggnog Mile, 10:30 a.m. Saturday at American River College, go to http://sacramentoegg nogmile.blogspot.com.

V"Gov. Pat McCrory says he signed off on the controversial pink licenses that will be issued to some young illegal immigrants who were granted protection from deportation for two years. The new North Carolina governor said he thought it was important that the drivers licenses for immigrants clearly distinguish between legal presence versus legal status.Critics have decried them as a modern-day scarlet letter. The new drivers licenses will have a bright pink stripe and bold words NO LAWFUL STATUS, written in red capital letters across the front, according to mock-ups.McCrory said he wanted to make sure the licenses were granted but also ensure that they clearly differed in appearance from other licenses issued by the state to prevent misuse.I thought it was a very sound resolution based upon on federal and attorney generals ruling, McCrory said.After weeks of controversy, N.C. Transportation Secretary Tony Tata announced this month that licenses would be issued to thousands of participants in the Obama administrations Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It blocks deportation and grants a two-year work permit to undocumented youths who came to the United States before they turned 16, are not older than 30, and are high school graduates, attend college or have served in the military.At first, the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles said it would grant licenses to immigrants in that class. But then the department delayed a decision until it received a legal opinion from Attorney General Roy Cooper. Last month, Coopers office said those in the program should be eligible for driving privileges.Last week, a group of Republican legislators, including Rep. Mark Brody, R-Monroe, introduced a bill to put a temporary moratorium on issuing the licenses. Brody said Tata overstepped his authority. The department is supposed to begin issuing licenses on March 25 to program participants who pass tests and provide documentation.More than 15,600 people in North Carolina have been accepted to the federal program announced in June. An estimated 18,000 are eligible. Critics of the new license design, such as Armando Bellmas of the Latin American Coalition in Charlotte, charged that the proposed license design was discriminatory and created a class of inferior citizens.The way these licenses have been issued is a direct attack on the immigrant community in North Carolina, he said in a statement.McCrory is in Washington this weekend for the National Governors Association Conference winter meeting and discussions on the economy, health care, national security and natural resources. On Monday, he will join other governors for a dinner with President Barack Obama and the first lady."\u000a

V"KALANGERA, Malawi  The farm fields here are cemeteries of cornstalks: A severe drought has left them brown, withered and dead. Normally, a failed crop like that signifies starvation. Then television cameras arrive and transmit images of famished children into American and European living rooms. Emergency food shipments are rushed in at huge expense. Yet there is a better way, and it's unfolding here in rural Malawi, in southern Africa. Instead of shipping food after the fact, the U.S. aid agency, USAID, has been working with local farmers to promote new crops and methods so that farmers don't have to worry about starving in the first place. Jonas Kabudula is a local farmer whose corn crop completely failed, and he said that normally he and his family would now be starving. But with the help of a USAID program, he and other farmers also planted chilies, a nontraditional crop that doesn't need much rain. ""Other crops wither, and the chilies survive,"" Kabudula told me. What's more, each bag of chilies is worth about five bags of corn, so he and other villagers have been able to sell the chilies and buy all the food they need. ""If it weren't for the chilies,"" said another farmer, Staford Phereni, ""we would have no food."" President Barack Obama has made agriculture a focus of his foreign aid programs with mixed results. On the plus side, these initiatives are smart, cost-effective and potentially transformative. On the negative side, they're boring. At a time when there's a vigorous political debate in America about foreign aid, outreach to African farmers doesn't wow Congress or the American people. But if it's boring, it's also succeeding. I'm on my annual win-a-trip journey with a university student  this year, it's Jordan Schermerhorn of Rice University  and we have seen fields here being irrigated for the first time, powered by foot-pedal treadle pumps (resembling elliptical machines from an American gym). Some of the farmers are trading up from foot power. Evelyn Kadzamira, a barefoot entrepreneur, showed off a $110 gas pump that she purchased with help from her village savings and loan association. She waters her crops with it and plans to soon start renting it out to others as well. USAID can work with only a tiny minority of farmers. But agricultural innovations can go viral, and that's how Kadzamira got started. ""We saw others irrigate last year and were successful, while we didn't irrigate and went hungry,"" she said. ""So, this year, we decided to irrigate."" The backdrop is that for half a century, agriculture has been one of Africa's failures. Agricultural yields in Africa are only one-third of the global average, and they have risen much more slowly than in the rest of the world. As a result, Africa's share of global agricultural trade has fallen from 8 percent in 1960 to around 3 percent today, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute. Only 3.5 percent of African cropland is irrigated, compared with 39 percent in South Asia, according to the United Nations. Asia applies almost 20 times as much fertilizer as Africa. And plant scientists have developed few crop varieties tailored for Africa. The upshot is that about 47 percent of children under 5 years old in Malawi are stunted from malnutrition. Yet now there are signs that African agriculture is poised to surge, despite warnings from climate scientists of weather changes linked to rising carbon emissions. The improved prospects reflect growing efforts to place agriculture at the center of efforts to fight poverty. Malawi itself has also made progress by defying global experts and subsidizing fertilizer. This went against international advice  African governments have been pressured to cut subsidies of all kinds  but more fertilizer use led to huge increases in harvests, and Malawi has become a net corn exporter. Another challenge for farmers has been poor storage: Up to 40 percent of the corn crop is lost after harvest because of rodents, insects and moisture. So CARE, the international aid group, is showing farmers how to construct mini-silos  made of mud and resting on stilts  that reduce spoilage to about 5 percent. In Kasungu, in northern Malawi, a woman named Viknesi Chimbonga showed me two of these new mud silos that she had built. These allow her to store her corn for months and sell it in the ""hungry season"" just before the next harvest, when prices are five times higher. Chimbonga never went to school, but she is planning to use the profits to send her son to university. He would be the first student from her village to go. So, sure, there's no less glamorous kind of foreign aid than chilies, irrigation pumps and mud silos. But if this kind of assistance can help end famine and emergency aid, and if it can send kids to college, then let's celebrate boring aid!"\u000a

V"Sometime Friday, the federal government will take the first step toward cutting spending in dozens of departments and programs after the two major parties each tried and failed to muscle partisan alternatives through the Senate.With the last-minute effort to avert the automatic spending cuts failed, the House of Representativs adjourned, the Senate wrapped up its scheduled business for the week, and most members went home.That raised the stakes for a Friday meeting at the White House with President Barack Obama and the leaders of both parties in Congress as they debate how or whether they can change course in the days ahead as the spending cuts take effect over timeTomorrow I will bring together leaders from both parties to discuss a path forward, Obama said after the congressional votes failed. As a nation, we cant keep lurching from one manufactured crisis to another, he said. Middle-class families cant keep paying the price for dysfunction in Washington. We can build on the over $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction weve already achieved, but doing so will require Republicans to compromise. Thats how our democracy works, and thats what the American people deserve.With Congress gone, even a last-minute breakthrough agreement that no one expects likely would come too late to stop the first moves to start cutting $85 billion from this years $3.5 trillion budget. Sometime before midnight  the 2011 law requiring the cuts stipulated only that they start going into effect on March 1  Obama is expected to sign a directive ordering the White House Office of Management and Budget to start putting the cuts into effect. With much of the federal budget such as Social Security off limits, the cuts will be concentrated on a smaller part of the government, split evenly between defense and non-defense programs. Many will take weeks or even months to go into effect.The 2011 law set the automatic cuts to force Congress and Obama to come up with a more palatable alternative to curb deficits by $1.2 trillion over 10 years. But Democrats insisted insisted on adding tax increases and smaller spending cuts. Republicans insisted that it all be done with spending cuts.And thats where they ended up again Thursday in the Senate.Democrats proposed curbing projected deficits with a minimum 30 percent tax on millionaires, the closing of tax loopholes, and spending cuts to military and farm programs.Republicans proposed keeping the same amount of spending cuts but giving Obama flexibility in how the cuts are implemented.What were about to go through is in some respects a charade because we know that the proposal on that (Democratic) side will not succeed with 60 votes, said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The proposal on this side will not succeed with 60 votes. Meanwhile the clock moves on until some time tomorrow night.The Republican bill fell far short of the 60-vote threshold on a procedural vote and was defeated with 38 senators for and 62 against. Nine Republicans  McCain and Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Kelly Ayote of New Hampshire, Susan Collins of Maine, Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada and Mike Lee of Utah voted against the measure. Two Democratic senators, Mark Warner of Virginia and Max Baucus of Montana, voted for the Republican bill.The Democratic measure failed 51-49. Democratic Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada voted with Republicans against the bill.Both sides seemed publicly cemented in their positions Thursday. At the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney mocked the Republican proposal, asserting that no amount of flexibility changes the fact that these severe cuts threaten thousands of middle-class jobs and slash vital services for children, seniors, and our troops and military families.Obama hopes that Republicans, whether its the short term or the long term, are ready to talk seriously about compromise and making sure that Washington is not inflicting wounds on the economy right when the economy should be growing and creating jobs, Carney said. Boehner and McConnell didnt sound like they were in compromising moods Thursday.The president and the Democrat leaders have failed to pass a solution of their own, Boehner told reporters. My message at the White House will be the same as what Im telling you today. Its time for them to do their job.McConnell said he plans to make clear to Obama Friday that the American people will simply not accept replacing spending cuts agreed to by both parties with tax hikes.No more protecting waste and broken programs at the expense of those who actually need government help, McConnell said. The American people were promised more spending control, and Republicans are going to help them see that that promise is fulfilled  and in the smartest way possible.Even before Thursdays votes and Fridays meeting, congressional Democrats and Republicans were looking ahead, suggesting that the cuts could be restored, or at least reconsidered, in budget fights to come. Thats likely to come over the next three weeks when government funding expires March 27, requiring new budget legislation called a continuing resolution. What I would hope is that the Republicans there, both of them, would agree with their Republicans around the country that we should have a balanced approach to get rid of this and look forward to the sequestration, which is the 27th of next month, Reid said. It would be so easy to do. There are things that theyve agreed to in the past on taking  getting rid of some of the tax loopholes and doing things of that nature that we could have a balanced approach."\u000a

V"The White House on Sunday ramped up its campaign to avoid across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to take place in less than a week by releasing detailed estimates of what reductions could mean in every state.In California, for example, 1,210 teachers and aides could lose their jobs, according to the White House. In Florida, 7,450 fewer children could receive vaccines for diseases. In North Carolina, 800 victims of domestic violence could go without treatment.This is a small sample of the consequences in the states across the country in everything from education, national defense, environment, public health, Jason Furman, principal deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters Sunday.Five days before the cuts are slated to take place, Obama administration officials, members of Congress and governors continued to point fingers for the cuts while warning about the possible dire consequences.The automatic cuts  known inside the Beltway as sequestration  are the result of a bipartisan deal struck in 2011 to raise the nations debt ceiling. Congress agreed that if a 12-member committee failed to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over the next decade, the cuts would come from government spending. This sequester is going into effect because Republicans are choosing for it to go into effect, Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer said. Theyve made that choice.The first round of cuts -- now estimated at $85 billion -- was set to start in January. But the White House and Congress agreed to delay that until March 1 as part of a deal that raised taxes on the richest 1 percent of Americans. ""Republicans in the House have voted - twice - to replace President Obamas sequester with smarter spending cuts, said Michael Steel, a spokeman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The White House needs to spend less time explaining to the press how bad the sequester will be and more time actually working to stop it. Obama is urging Congress to delay the reductions, even by a few months, by passing a package of modest cuts and additional revenue by eliminating tax loopholes benefiting certain industries or the wealthy.But many Republicans oppose increases in revenue. Some want to the cuts occur while others are eyeing an 11th-hour change to the law that would allow agencies to determine how to best administer the reductions.Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos the worst of the cuts could be alleviated with some flexibility. We can get all through this, he said. The best way to do it is just allow flexibility. If you allow flexibility you dont have to shut down the carrier.White House spokesman Jay Carney has insisted for weeks that the agencies have no flexibility. Administration officials did not respond to questions Sunday about whether they would support a change in law to gain flexibility.But on Sunday some Democratic lawmakers continued to say the best course of action is a compromise between the Republican-led House an Democratic-controlled Senate to avert the cuts.Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said on Fox News Sunday that Defense Department officials have said even if we did some kind of flexibility move at the 11th hour, its too little, too late in terms of what theyve got in motion.In recent days, the White House has directed Cabinet secretaries to begin speaking about the potential cuts with both Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood appearing on talk shows Sunday.LaHood said travelers will likely endure 90-minute waits flying to major U.S. cities such as New York and Chicago because of fewer controllers on staff.Its the Congresss opportunity this week, as they come back from listening to their constituents about all the hurt thats going to be taking place in the country as a result of this sequester, he said on NBCs Meet the Press. I believe these members of Congress will push their leaders to say lets fix this before Friday.Staff writer Lesley Clark contributed to this report."\u000a

V"Pete De Toro is a gregarious, self-assured cybersecurity expert who has worked 16 seasons as a Bella Vista High School assistant football coach.But when he glances at new Broncos head coach Tom Ingles, he can't help but harken back 35 years to his days as a rudderless 15-year-old in a new town and state.Ingles helped set De Toro on the right course.He coached De Toro in football and basketball at Liberty High School, a newly opened school in Renton, Wash. But Ingles offered the Southern California transplant a lot more than how to tackle and rebound.""I grew up without a father, so he was like a father to me,"" De Toro said. ""He had a huge influence on my life as far as how to treat people, work ethic and giving back. Even then, I knew I was playing for someone special.""Many of the players on this year's Bella Vista football team are starting to realize the same thing.While junior quarterback Austin Harmer already knew Ingles is in the Washington State Coaches Association Hall of Fame with an impeccable record of success, he was shocked last spring when the 63-year-old Ingles wanted to meet individually with him, something he would do with every Bella Vista player.""I've never had a coach do that before,"" Harmer said. ""I got the sense right away that he wants to know more about you as a person than just as a football player. He's unlike any coach I have ever had.""Senior running back Joe Anderson is used to coaches yelling and screaming to get attention. Ingles has a different approach.""What stands out to me is his calm tone,"" Anderson said. ""Even when you know he's upset with you, he remains calm.""They appreciate his patience, attention to detail, sense of humor, magnetic storytelling and throwback conditioning drills.""We're working harder than ever, and yet it doesn't seem like hard work, even though it's exhausting,"" Harmer said.Ingles coached varsity football for 33 seasons in Washington, winning 248 games and three state championships.He moved to Woodland to join his wife, Zena, who works as a junior high principal in Davis. Ingles had stayed in Washington to provide end-of-life care for his parents.""At first, I didn't miss coaching,"" said Ingles, who last coached at Puyallup High in 2009. ""I was so busy with the move down here. But after a while my wife told me I needed to find something to do. It wasn't exactly an ultimatum, but I was missing football.""Ingles had seen Bella Vista play a couple of times and through De Toro had gotten to know then-head coach Matt Polston and some of the players. When Polston stepped down at the end of the 2011 season, Ingles applied and was hired.""When I learned he got the job, I was excited for BV and the kids,"" said De Toro, also an assistant boys basketball coach at Bella Vista. ""Someone with his quality and credentials doesn't come along every day. That I get to share this coaching experience with him, I have to pinch myself.""Ingles' goals are simple. Elevate the football program to the level of championship caliber established by the boys' soccer, basketball and baseball teams on campus.Bella Vista finished 3-7 last season (0-5 in the Capital Valley Conference). The Broncos have been to the playoffs just once in the past eight years, so Ingles isn't predicting any miracles.""There is some really good high school football here,"" Ingles said. ""I've been weeding through film of our league rivals, and from what I've seen so far, we've got our work cut out for us. It takes awhile to put a program into place.""Ingles also is trying to adjust to the football culture shock.He's amazed at how much parental fundraising and booster support is required at Bella Vista compared to his days in Washington; the contrast in the quality of the facilities; and how close schools are to one another geographically  thwarting the concept of school loyalty.""The financing is very different,"" Ingles said. ""In Washington, (student body) fees pay for everything. Here, you have parents cutting the grass, washing the uniforms, raising money for coaching stipends.""Up there, we had two Astro-turf fields, and we never played on grass (Bella Vista's stadium has a grass field). So that's going to be a big change.""Bella Vista has played in the shadows of neighboring powerhouse league rivals Del Campo and Casa Roble, which are within 10 minutes of the Fair Oaks school.""In Washington, the schools are so geographically spread out that kids grow up wanting to play for their neighborhood schools,"" Ingles said. ""You knew if a kid came to your school as a ninth-grader, you'd have him until he was a senior.""Ingles' biggest personal adjustment has been acclimating to the summer heat. He's drinking copious amounts of water as the thermometer has hovered around 100 degrees since practice started Aug. 6.""The heat is a dramatic change for me,"" Ingles said during another steamy practice. ""I bring out six, 20-ounce waters and drink them all.""In Washington, I'd drink water maybe once during a practice. But 80 degrees up there would be a really hot day."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/12/09/5041709/fans-turn-out-and-are-not-disappointed.html,"Saturday night proved why Sacramento is a hotbed for high school sports.A crowd of more than 10,000 filed into Sacramento State to watch De La Salle of Concord play Folsom in the inaugural CIF Division I Open Division championship football game, perhaps the most important prep event in area history.A few miles south, a near-packed house of 1,100 watched national boys basketball powers Archbishop Mitty of San Jose and Sheldon tussle at Sheldon High School.The fans were well entertained.Behind star 6-foot-8 post Aaron Gordon's 24 points and jaw-dropping athletic play, Mitty held off a feisty and injury-depleted Sheldon 71-65.Mitty is the two-time defending CIF state D-II champion and ranked 12th nationally by USA Today and Maxpreps.com.Still, Sheldon (ranked No. 16 by Maxpreps) played the Monarchs tough despite missing four key players with injuries and another waiting to clear transfer eligibility. Among them is returning Bee Player of the Year D'Erryl Williams, out with a bone bruise in his foot.Sheldon's veterans Dakarai Allen (14 points) and Ryan Manning (12 points) battled foul trouble guarding Gordon, a national Top-10 recruit, who also missed time in foul trouble.But 5-9 freshman point guard Devin Greene, Sheldon's next emerging star, dazzled with 20 points, and senior Antonio Lewis added 17 points, including a three-pointer that had the Huskies within three, 68-65, with 23 seconds to play.But Gordon made three of four foul shots and Allen couldn't connect on two attempts from the floor to close it out.""We didn't play up to our potential,"" said Sheldon coach Joey Rollings. ""We kept making that run but falling short. Still, I'm proud of my guys. They battled against a good team and a great player in Gordon.""Like the De La Salle-Folsom game, CIF officials hope that non-league matchups like Mitty and Sheldon will be a prelude to reinvigorating this season's NorCal and state basketball playoffs, which are held at Sleep Train Arena in March.In past years, megapowers such as Sheldon and Mitty played for different divisional titles based on enrollment. Last year, Sheldon won the CIF NorCal Division I title and Mitty won the D-II crown.But the CIF approved a groundbreaking open division this season that will put as many as eight of Northern California's strongest boys teams in the same bracket. That likely will include Sheldon and Mitty.The idea is to try to infuse new blood into the divisional playoffs, give public schools a better chance of winning state titles and, with some new schools in the playoff pool, boost NorCal and state playoff attendance.In the last two years, private schools have won all 10 boys and girls state titles, even though 92 percent of the state's 1,500 high schools are public schools.Rollings has mixed feelings about the concept. He thinks it penalizes a public school program like his that competes with the top monied private schools.""It is what it is,"" Rollings said. ""Now every game is going to be like a final, so you aren't going to be able to rest, and that's going to hurt. But once we get all our guys back, I think we're going to be pretty good."""\u000a

V"Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood wants to hear from whistle-blowers with inside information about how the Gulf Coast Claims Facility is operating.Hood believes GCCF administrator Ken Feinberg ""stiff-armed"" claimants on emergency and interim claims because they required no release of the right to sue BP and other parties responsible for the April 2010 Gulf oil catastrophe. When claimants grew desperate, Hood believes, GCCF rolled out final payments that do require waiving the right to sue.""They're not following the law,"" Hood said. ""They're just trying to coerce people into signing these releases."" Hood has urged Gulf residents to continue filing interim claims, which provide quarterly payments for documented losses without legal releases. The interim payments cover only losses already suffered. Final payments and ""quick"" final payments also cover future losses.Feinberg said the proof is in the numbers: ""The idea that 90,000 people have been misled or have been compelled, I don't buy that argument for one minute. To me, the statistics don't lie. If 90,000 people for the entire Gulf have taken the quick pay, it is because they have been adequately compensated or they have no further damage that they can document. It's an opportunity for them to get additional money.""I think any other argument is made up. It's lacking any foundation in reality here. That's my view.""Quick payments are $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for businesses. Losses do not have to be documented, but only claimants already compensated on an emergency basis are eligible.Read more of this story at SunHerald.com"\u000a

Lifting frozen birds did a lot to lift the spirits of those in need.""I'm very impressed with these young men for donating their time,"" Sally Richards, 60, of Elk Grove said. ""They have a new fan in me. I'll be watching them.""That's exactly why Huskies coach Joey Rollings rallied his team for this cause. With high-profile status comes more responsibility, he said. Sheldon is ranked No. 3 in the state in the preseason by CalHiSports.com and No. 4 by MaxPreps.com. The Huskies went 29-6 last season and return most of their roster.""People know who these kids are, this team, and we wanted to give back,"" Rollings said. ""We can do our part.

V"Less than 24 hours after a contentious meeting with parents, Rio Americano High School principal Brian Ginter on Tuesday relieved football coach Christian Mahaffey of his duties and reinstated 11 players who left the team in support of a teammate.The move left Ginter searching for a head coach, a hire he hopes to have in place today. Rio Americano plays its Capital Athletic League opener Friday at Cordova.Ginter met Tuesday with the coach and told Mahaffey he was bringing back the 11 players with a one-game suspension ""for insubordination.""""He felt he couldn't be able to coach effectively if that happened and that he would not do that,"" Ginter said. ""So at that particular time, I had to let him go.""The players told the coach last Wednesday they no longer would play unless he reinstated senior receiver-defensive end Guillermo Salazar.Salazar was forced to quit the team Sept. 25 when he informed Mahaffey he would miss the Raiders' home game against Whitney on Oct. 13 to attend a weekend baseball showcase in Peoria, Ariz. Salazar, a pitcher-infielder, is considered a college baseball prospect.Mahaffey said Salazar couldn't remain on the team if he was going to miss the league game to attend an out-of-season event. The Raiders' three-sport star also has been reinstated.Mahaffey, who has coached football at the school for 17 seasons, the last four as head coach, refused to resign.""I felt I was painted into a corner,"" said Mahaffey, an off-campus coach who teaches special education in the San Juan Unified School District. ""I tried to stand up for the right thing and still think I have.  I couldn't coach a group of kids who bullied their way back on the football team.""Mahaffey's longtime assistants, Jason Wallace and Kendall Hutchings, also were relieved of their duties in supporting their leader.""There wasn't a cross word,"" Mahaffey, 44, said of the meeting that included athletic director Karen Hanks. ""There is no animosity. Sometimes, coaches get fired.""Brian was put in a bad position, and he had to make a choice. I don't agree with the choice, but that's what a principal does.""Senior quarterback Mark Lyon, one of the 11 players who battled to get back on the team, said he supports Ginter's decision and agrees with the punishment of having to sit out Friday's game for walking out.""It wasn't handled the best way on either side,"" Lyon said. ""We understand the principal's decision to have us sit. We're a family at Rio, and we need to promote players doing other sports.""Ginter said there was a ""perception"" of Mahaffey applying his no out-of-season sports rule in a ""contradictory"" manner to other players for missing practices or games. Mahaffey said that claim was ""ridiculous.""""Based on the fact that there weren't any rules, guidelines or expectations given to the players in a written format that they had signed off on, I felt like I didn't have anything that could support the decision he made,"" Ginter said.Mahaffey and Ginter on Monday night held a meeting with parents and players that was emotional and contentious and during which, according to several sources, Mahaffey remained steadfast in his opposition to the players' return. The meeting was closed to the media.""I left the meeting reeling,"" Gabrielle Meindl, the parent of a player on the team, wrote in an e-mail to Ginter that she shared with The Bee. ""Coach Mahaffey showed no self reflection of his actions whatsoever.  This situation was handled abominably. Guillermo's opportunity should have been celebrated, not punished. And, I am proud for the seniors who stood up for the ill treatment of their teammate  to me, that shows character.""But Mahaffey felt it was he, his assistants and the 21 players who remained who showed character, not those who departed.""I gave them a chance after they came to me as a united group and gave me and my staff an ultimatum,"" Mahaffey said. ""We gave them 24 hours to make the right decision."""\u000a

V"Galt High School forfeited Friday night's home opener against Argonaut  a first since Galt started playing football in 1924  because of low player numbers and safety concerns.The Warriors are down to 13 healthy players after a rash of injuries sustained in a 38-7 opening-night loss last week to Orestimba and during practice this week.In consulting with the school administration, Warriors first-year coach J.J. Woodward begrudgingly agreed to sacrifice a game to regroup and heal for a Sept. 7 nonleague contest at Amador.The 30-man Galt junior varsity played Argonaut on Friday. Galt administrators and coaches didn't want to thin the junior varsity roster to fill the varsity's need out of concern that some 15-year-olds may not be ready for a jump in competition.At Galt, where the community has supported the football program for decades, the forfeiture was a blow on many layers, including a loss of thousands of dollars in gate receipts and concession sales that are vital for any high school's athletic programs.Woodward played high school sports in Half Moon Bay, a community big on athletics, 20 years ago.He said community support attracted him to Galt after recent coaching seasons in Stockton.""Football matters here, big time  people can't wait for Friday nights,"" Woodward said. ""Not playing a game hurts a lot of people, but at the same time, we have to be smart about this. We'll be back. We have a good group that won't fold.""Programs hindered by small rosters is a growing concern around the state.Sac-Joaquin Section Commissioner Pete Saco said last week that he fears varsity programs will fold in ""deciding that the fight just isn't worth it anymore.""Also Friday, Skyline of Oakland, coming off a 7-4 season, forfeited its game at Acalanes in Lafayette because of insufficient numbers.The Galt forfeit also brings up a brewing debate as to whether a second high school should have opened in a town where housing growth has stalled.Nearby Liberty Ranch, coming off a 9-4 playoff season with its first senior class, has 1,300 students with 39 varsity football players and 71 on the JV. Galt's enrollment has dipped to 985 this academic year.The Warriors last fielded a winning team in 2005 under famed coach Erv Hatzenbuhler, in his second tour back with the program after success in the 1970s and '80s. Galt has gone 16-45 since.Liberty Ranch and Galt share the latter's stadium, and the programs aspire for a decades-long rivalry.""I feel for Galt and for any program low in numbers,"" Liberty Ranch coach Bryan Golder said. ""Galt has lost a lot of students, and some are coming to Liberty Ranch, not just athletes.""It happens when new schools open, and it can make it hard on the old school."""\u000a

Grammy-nominated saxophonist Brown, with his generosity, changed Hunt's life.At 73, Brown performs every other month for the older adults living at Emeritus Senior Living's Laguna Creek facility. So when the nationwide Emeritus chain had a talent contest for seniors last year, Brown entered  and beat out 300 other participants to win.The prize? A year's free stay at an Emeritus facility of his choice, worth $50,000.He and his wife of 52 years, Janet Brown, 71, own their Laguna home  and they weren't looking to move into a seniors residence. For one thing, they're raising a 13-year-old granddaughter.And for another, said Brown, ""I'm too busy traveling.""I told the organizers I'd just give the prize to someone else. And I started calling around.""Enter Pat Beal, executive director of the Senior Center of Elk Grove, where Brown has performed through the years. Brown called, and Beal answered  and thought of longtime senior center participant Edna Hunt, who was looking for a new residence.""When we thought of someone who could use this service, we thought it would be a great opportunity for Edna,"" Beal said. ""I'm thrilled for her.""Said Hunt, ""I didn't really know what was going on. I couldn't afford this at all, but I'd been thinking about seniors housing.""Brown's donation is part of a lifetime of helping other people in need  starting, perhaps, with himself. As a young boy in St. Louis, he was shot in the face, leaving him blind by the age of 12. He began playing the saxophone at the Missouri School for the Blind, and by the time he was in high school, he said, he was playing with Ike Turner.Through the years, he also performed with Little Richard, Etta James, Lou Rawls and Jackie Wilson, he said.But Brown also stayed in school, eventually receiving a doctorate in clinical psychology, and he worked for decades in the prison systems in Arizona and California.""My function was to get inmates to take responsibility for their behavior,"" he said. ""I'm from the ghetto. We had something in common, but I didn't go to prison. I understood their dynamic. I'd say to them, 'If I can accomplish something without sight, can you imagine what you can accomplish with yours?' ""Since 1997, he's performed solo, putting out seven CDs and playing at private parties and senior centers.""He just wanted to come do it,"" said Brenda Chappell, Emeritus at Laguna Creek executive director. ""He's so unassuming.""Not surprisingly, Brown didn't want his talent show prize to go to waste, and he's pleased that Hunt has settled in so nicely in the small Emeritus apartment she's occupied since November.""People always ask, 'Why did you give it away?'

Rocklin (18-8, 6-3) needs a win to tie Granite Bay (18-8, 7-2) for league top honors. Granite Bay will be in the D-I playoffs and Rocklin in D-II.Also in Placer County tonight, No. 13 Colfax (21-5, 7-2) hosts No. 15 Lincoln (20-6, 7-2) for the Pioneer Valley League championship. Lincoln won the first meeting 57-46 Jan. 25.Colfax and Lincoln have played each other for 50 seasons. According to Mike Ray of the Gold Country News Service, Colfax in 1975 beat Lincoln 56-51 in the regular-season finale for the school's first league title with junior point guard Mike O'Connell, now the Colfax coach.In 2004, Colfax and Lincoln tied for the league title. Colfax later won the D-IV section title by downing Lincoln, then coached by O'Connell. This postseason, Lincoln will be in D-III and Colfax in D-IV.Buzzer beaters  Friday featured two last-second game winners to tighten league races.Devin Moss dribbled the length of the court for a layup at the buzzer to lift Rocklin past Roseville 82-81 in overtime. Meanwhile, Michael McNamara of No. 14 Placer threw a length-of-the-court pass to Peter Kean, who whipped the ball to a cutting Brennen Entz for the decisive basket in a 48-47 victory over Lincoln. It was Placer's second win over Lincoln this season.Nelson honored  At halftime of Sheldon's game tonight, the Huskies will retire jersey No. 21 in honor of DeMarcus Nelson.

Sophomore Bret Lynch leads the Mavericks in scoring (15.3 average) and senior Roman Zazhitskiy paces the team in rebounding (9.9).Blue Devils suspension  The fallout from a heated Delta Valley Conference game Wednesday between Davis and Monterey Trail resulted in a one-game school-enforced suspension for Blue Devils senior forward Kevin Sorensen.Davis rallied from 19 down to win 67-65 and clinch a playoff berth in a game that included intentional fouls and technical fouls.Sorensen was suspended after he yelled an obscenity toward Monterey Trail coach Ken Manfredi upon fouling out.Davis athletic director Dennis Foster and a Davis police officer made sure the postgame handshake line was peaceful. Both sides admitted that emotions had crossed the line.Sorenson missed a 73-59 loss at Franklin in a regular-season finale Friday."\u000a

While in its infancy, the proposal from the Wilton Rancheria is to take 160 acres of farmland into federal trust and eventually build a casino on the site in unincorporated Sacramento County northeast of the city of Galt. The proposed site is south of Arno Road between Highway 99 and the Union Pacific Railroad.The tribe has yet to file an application to start the multi-year process of taking the land into federal trust, said Carmen Facio, realty officer for the Sacramento office of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.Tribes seeking to take land into federal trust  a required step before a casino can be opened  must meet federal environmental rules, Facio noted. In addition, traffic and infrastructure requirements must be studied. ""There are a lot of things that go into it,"" Facio said.Getting state approval would present another significant obstacle.Late last year, the tribe met privately with Sacramento County and Elk Grove city officials. The 7 p.m. presentation at today's Galt council meeting will be the first time the plan will be discussed before a public body. The council meets at 380 Civic Drive in Galt.

This will be the first step in what will likely be many opportunities for public comment.""A tribal official offered to detail the plan today.Behrmann said it's too early to say whether benefits, in the form of job creation or infrastructure improvements, will outweigh negative impacts. In 2009, shortly after the Wilton Miwok were restored by the federal government as a tribe, their plan to build a casino near Wilton rankled Elk Grove and Sacramento County officials.A 2011 memorandum of understanding between the county, city of Elk Grove and the Rancheria, settling a lawsuit, gives the city and county more leverage in mitigating impacts, said Sacramento County Supervisor Don Nottoli. ""If you are going to locate more intense types of uses  people are all better served when they are located where there is access (to transportation and services),"" Nottoli said.Wilton Rancheria Indian Tribe is formed from Wilton Rancheria Miwok and the Me-Wuk Indian Community of the Wilton Rancheria. It has more than 500 members. Call The Bee's Ed Fletcher, (916) 321-1269. Follow him on Twitter @NewsFletch."\u000a

Eric Denio has seen the pain of it at Denio's Roseville Farmers Market.""I ran across a fella in his mid-30s who had  this brand-new jetted tub, and it was still wrapped. It had the jets and the motor and everything. I asked him, 'Do you own a construction company? Are you closing something out?' ""He said, 'Yeah, I had a six-bedroom home in Los Lagos (Granite Bay), and I didn't think about the reality of the housing market. I got too big for my britches. 'I lost everything. I'm out here liquidating. I just bought this particular tub. I was going to do a job. The deal fell through. I've got to get rid of it.' ""Denio took home that $3,000 tub for $500. He said there have been many other queries at the flea market run by three generations of his family.""There was one the other day, a lady, just a sweetheart of a person,"" said Denio, the company's marketing manager. ""I talked to her for a while, and she had lost a 4,000-square-foot pad. They foreclosed on her, and she had to move into a 1,000- square-foot apartment.""She didn't know what to do with all the stuff she had.  I told her, 'Bring the stuff out here and you can move it a lot quicker than taking it to a house and hoping a lot of cars drive by.' ""A lifetime opportunity?A flea market just might be a home for a lifetime  or two lifetimes, if children take the reins. Jenny Abernathy will retire in two weeks after 40 years at the Folsom Boulevard Flea Market, 8521 Folsom Blvd., in Sacramento.

Three years ago, Abiking Lirio took over the Denio's booth where his parents had sold artificial trees and arrangements for 20 years.""I saw the benefits of working this business. I got my two houses from it,"" said Lirio, who has a degree in marketing from California State University, Sacramento.Abernathy, 74, worked other jobs at local restaurants and at the Sacramento Convention Center, but whenever she wasn't working for someone else, she was working for herself.

V"The swift arrest Sunday of a local teenager who threatened a campus shooting on Facebook underscored how seriously communities take online comments in the wake of violent school incidents.The Sacramento County Sheriff's Department found no evidence that a 17-year-old El Camino Fundamental High School student was planning to carry out his threat, Sgt. Jason Ramos said Monday. But the student was arrested hours after parents and fellow students saw his post and notified officials.""Sometimes, people are venting or blowing off steam,"" Ramos said. ""But we can't be flip or naive about investigating these cases. Today's climate being what it is on school campuses, sensitivity is elevated.""Attendance at El Camino was noticeably lower Monday, possibly the result of parents keeping their kids home as a precaution, the school district said. Actual attendance figures weren't available.An extra security officer was on duty at the Arden Arcade high school, and a deputy's car was stationed on the street corner near the campus.Ramos said the suspect posted a threat Sunday afternoon to commit a shooting Monday morning at the high school. He did not direct his remarks at any specific individual.Between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. Sunday, sheriff's officials received about 15 calls from concerned parents.""Kids were tweeting and Facebooking each other, and this almost immediately went viral,"" Ramos said.Working with San Juan Unified School District and El Camino staff, deputies quickly learned the identity of the boy, found his address and went to the home.""His parents were extremely cooperative, and they granted us permission to search the house,"" Ramos said. ""We were looking for means for him to carry out the threat and found nothing like that.""The boy was arrested on a felony charge of threatening to commit a crime resulting in serious injury. His name was withheld because he is a juvenile.Ramos said deputies decided to arrest the youth and take him into custody, citing the high number of potential victims at the school.Trent Allen, a San Juan spokesman, said schools take seriously any posts that threaten someone physically or emotionally, including remarks about self-inflicted harm. Some postings are referred to school counselors for investigation.""How often do students make Facebook posts that are poor choices, or can contain threats, either veiled or unveiled?"" Allen said. ""The truth is, it happens too often. The lesson we're trying to drive home is, whether it's an offhanded comment or you're saying it with intent, we will treat it the same. Be careful what you say.""Allen said the district will seek disciplinary action against the student.Ramos said a specific threat of a school shooting in the Sacramento area is rare. He praised students for telling their parents, and parents for taking the threat seriously. At least one student reportedly took a screen shot of the posting before the suspect removed it, which helped law enforcement locate the youth. Call The Bee's Anne Gonzales, (916) 321-1049."\u000a

V"A California state lawmaker is calling for a federal investigation into the alleged ""dumping"" of a Nevada mental patient last month in Sacramento.Hospital and health officials in Nevada, meanwhile, vowed to look into the circumstances surrounding the patient's release and issue a public report about what happened.""We don't take this lightly at all,"" said Dr. Tracey Green, Nevada's state health officer.The patient, James Flavy Coy Brown, 48, disappeared onto Sacramento's streets last month, a day after he arrived by Greyhound bus from Las Vegas, according to staffers at the Loaves & Fishes homeless services complex near downtown Sacramento. According to staffers who spoke to him, he said he had no family in Sacramento and had never visited the capital city.Brown was frightened and confused when he arrived at the Loaves & Fishes complex on Feb. 13, staffer Molly Simones said. He carried his discharge papers from the Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services psychiatric hospital and a schedule detailing his 15-hour bus ride from Las Vegas.The medical discharge papers, obtained by The Bee, ordered that Brown be taken ""to the Greyhound bus station by taxi with 3 day supply of medication,"" including one drug to treat schizophrenia and another for depression.Brown told Loaves staffers that he and four other patients were sent to the Las Vegas mental hospital a few weeks ago, after their group home shut down. Simones said Brown told her that, upon discharge from the hospital, he was given a bus ticket to Sacramento and told to call 911 when he arrived. Instead, he went to a local police station. She said he told her his four former housemates were shipped to other California cities.After Sacramento police took Brown to Loaves, Simones gave him bus fare to UC Davis Medical Center. It is unclear whether Brown made it to the facility or to the Sacramento County Mental Health Treatment Center across the street. ""I just hope he's OK,"" Simones said.California state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, a Sacramento Democrat, said he believes Nevada engaged in ""patient dumping"" by sending a mentally ill man to California without showing that he had relatives here or a place to get care.Late Monday, Steinberg sent a letter to the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, accusing the Nevada facility of engaging in interstate ""Greyhound therapy"" and calling for an investigation.Steinberg noted that the hospital is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and accredited by the federal Joint Commission. Hospitals that violate regulations governing those programs risk losing critical federal funding.""Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services has unequivocally failed to meet many of these conditions, including an evaluation of the patient's needs upon discharge, a standard discharge plan, and an appropriate arrangement for the patient's transfer to California,"" Steinberg wrote.The hospital's handling of Brown's case ""is a clear violation of the patient's civil rights, tantamount to abuse,"" he wrote. ""It is imperative for the rights and future safety of patients that those responsible are held accountable.""Patient dumping has been the subject of several lawsuits in recent years. In one case successfully prosecuted by the Los Angeles Public Counsel, a hospital released an elderly woman still wearing her hospital gown onto the streets of that city's Skid Row. California law prohibits such ""dumping"" of patients within the state, said Patrick Dunlevy, directing attorney of the counsel's Consumer Law Project.If Nevada did, in fact, transfer Brown across state lines, the case likely would fall under the federal civil rights law, Dunlevy said. ""Something like this is so outrageous, there have to be federal laws that do apply,"" he said.Green, the Nevada state health officer, said the state does not practice patient dumping and is looking into the circumstances of Brown's release.""We just do not let people go without a plan,"" Green said.She said a report should be available to the public in about a month.

V"Lawyers in the molestation case against former Citrus Heights principal Robert Adams sparred Monday over his statements to police and whether they amounted to an admission that he touched young girls inappropriately.Citrus Heights Police Officer Joe Rangel concluded his third day of testimony in Sacramento Superior Court by recalling that Adams said he was ""scared to death"" in the summer of 2011 when he was being arrested after the closure of his private Creative Frontiers School.Rangel indicated that Adams gave conflicting stories as he interviewed the 61-year-old about allegations from students that he had touched them inappropriately.""I did not touch her or anybody,"" Rangel said Adams claimed when he asked about one alleged victim.But Rangel added that Adams also gave other responses as he interviewed him.Under questioning from prosecutor Kevin Jones, the officer said he asked Adams twice whether the accusers were all lying. Adams paused both times and did not answer, Rangel said.He also asked about a 4-year-old girl's claim that ""Mr. Bob touched my pee-pee"" and said Adams responded, ""Yeah.""Rangel also said he asked Adams if the touching of girls could have been an accident.""Obviously, no, it wasn't an accident if we are here,"" Rangel quoted Adams as saying. ""Obviously not.""But defense attorney Linda Parisi painted a different picture, noting that Adams, who was treated for chest pains the day of his arrest, had complained during the interview of feeling ill and dizzy.She noted that her client had categorically denied any inappropriate behavior and had himself authored the school touching policy on how to properly interact with children.She also noted that the school had cameras throughout most areas  which Adams had installed after facing a 1999 complaint about touching girls  and that video recordings seized by police did not show any inappropriate acts.Judge Kevin J. McCormick ordered the hearing to resume this morning. He must decide whether there is enough evidence to order Adams to stand trial.Citrus Heights detective William Sanderson is expected to continue testimony today. He took the stand for a brief period Monday and described interviewing two alleged victims just last month.Sanderson said he conducted the interviews via Skype video conferences with two young women who were girls when their allegations were first investigated in 2000.Charges were not filed at the time, but the two are included in the six felony molestation charges and one misdemeanor count Adams now faces.Sanderson said one interview was with a woman who is 21 now and was 8 at the time of the 2000 investigation. That probe involved allegations that Adams had molested her and one other girl around that time, and Sanderson said he played a video recording for her of the interview she gave authorities when she was 8.The woman said in 2000 that she believed she had been molested 20 to 25 times, but told Sanderson last month that she now estimates it happened at least 10 times.The woman, identified only by her initials, ""told me that Mr. Bob would grab her and put her on his lap and would not let her go,"" Sanderson testified. ""He would call her Barbie.""Adams would reach up under her shirt and feel her chest area, Sanderson said, adding that the woman said it ""felt like a spider going up her shirt.""The allegations against Adams involve students dating from the late 1990s to 2011, when the state Department of Social Services shut the school down.

V"The latest chapter of Wal-Mart's ever-expanding presence in the Sacramento area is producing demand for about 265 workers at a soon-to-open general merchandise store in Elk Grove.Officials said they expect the 148,200-square-foot Elk Grove store at 10075 Bruceville Road to open in March.To screen job candidates, Wal-Mart has opened a temporary hiring center at 9561 Laguna Springs Drive, Suite 110, in Elk Grove. The hiring center is open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday. Applicants can also apply online at www.careers.walmart.com.""We are hiring both full- and part-time associates,"" said Jorge Sabido, store manager. Sabido said workers are needed in all areas of the Elk Grove store, including supervisory positions. The majority of hires will begin work in February to help prepare the store for its grand opening.The store opening is part of a lengthy process that prompted some Elk Grove residents to oppose Wal-Mart's past plans, citing the potential for traffic, noise and crime.Wal-Mart raised eyebrows in March last year when it said it had hired a general contractor to begin work on a general merchandise store at the site, even though it had not yet received a building permit from the city of Elk Grove.At the time, Wal-Mart officials said the company had a site permit from the city for grading and other work already under way.City officials said Tuesday that Wal-Mart has, over time, operated within its requirements for building at the site.Since spring 2012, Wal-Mart's presence in the Sacramento region has grown significantly, including in Elk Grove. In November, Wal-Mart opened a Neighborhood Market on Elk Grove Boulevard, the fourth new store opening in two months.On Sept. 19 last year, Wal-Mart simultaneously opened the doors on five Neighborhood Market stores in the Central Valley, three of them in the Sacramento area, touting a boost of more than 350 jobs.Started in 1998, Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Market chain now includes 200 stores nationwide. The stores tout quick, convenient and affordable shopping for groceries, pharmacy items and general merchandise.The markets also have put more pressure on older, unionized grocers such as West Sacramento-based Raley's."\u000a

V"The Environmental Council of Sacramento and the Sierra Club have sued Sacramento County over its approval of the Cordova Hills development on the eastern edge of the county.Environmentalists complain that the project is a continuation of suburban development that leads to more driving and pollution. They also worry about the loss of vernal pools, seasonal wetlands that provide habitat for protected species such as shrimp.""This project is classic leapfrog sprawl development,"" said Sean Wirth, conservation chair for the Mother Lode Chapter of the Sierra Club, in a news release.In late January, county supervisors approved the 2,700-acre development, which calls for up to 8,000 housing units and commercial development off Grant Line Road next to Rancho Cordova.Developer Ron Alvarado defended the project.""Cordova Hills has been collaboratively planned under some of the most stringent, substantial and environmentally sensitive criteria ever seen for a land-use plan in the region,"" he said.In the lawsuit filed Friday in Superior Court, environmentalists accuse the county of violating the California Environmental Quality Act. They ask the court to set aside the county's environmental impact report and overturn its approval of the project.The county's environmental impact report failed to take into account that the developer has not secured a university for the project, which means residents of the new development will drive more to reach employment and create more pollution, the lawsuit claims.The impact report wrongly makes the assumption that the university will offset pollution that would otherwise be expected, according to the lawsuit.""The premise of the application is that this project is justifiable, regardless of location, because it has a feature that helps reduce the impact,"" said Rob Burness of the Environmental Council of Sacramento. ""When the university disappeared, that argument went away.""County supervisors approved the project even after the head of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments told them it could push the region out of compliance with Senate Bill 375, a state law that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through land-use and transportation planning.County spokeswoman Chris Andis said the county would not comment because it has yet to see the petition.In the past, county officials have pointed to the developer's agreement to commit time and money to try to attract a university to the project, and to give the county land set aside for the university if he is not able to find a school for the site.County officials have also defended the project by saying that it will contain a number of environmentally sensitive features, such as a shuttle service.

V"A jury in federal court has found that Sacramento County sheriff's deputies violated the constitutional rights of two men by subjecting them to excessive force while they were jail inmates.The eight-member panel, however, awarded each man only $1 in damages.This was the second trial of a civil rights lawsuit brought against the county by Robert E. Hunter and Howard Eley. A jury in 2008 rejected their highly publicized claims that they were attacked while in custody for no legitimate reason.But a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that the jurors were not properly instructed on the law by U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. and sent the case back to him for a retrial.Friday's verdict allows the men's attorney, Gary Gorski, to ask Burrell to order the county to pay his fees and costs. It will be up to the judge how much money Gorski is entitled to based on the work he did and the mixed-message verdict.Gorski filed a motion over the weekend asking Burrell to make certain findings of fact based on the outcome of the trial, including that the deputies' unlawful actions grew out of a long-standing ""practice or custom  that constituted a standard operating procedure"" at the jail.The motion also seeks a permanent injunction from Burrell barring such behavior by deputies in the future.""The issuance of an injunction will serve the public interest in that it will prevent, or at least minimize, any future constitutional harm suffered by plaintiffs and others within the county of Sacramento at the hands of main jail deputies,"" the motion states.Hunter claimed the toilet in his detox cell was clogged and overflowing and he signaled deputies to alert them and requested access to another toilet.Instead, he alleged, he was thrown to the floor and subjected to force that resulted in an elbow fracture, stretched tendons and nerve damage.Eley alleged that he and then-Deputy William Kevin Sowles had a verbal exchange, ""following which Sowles shoved, slapped and then choked Eley without provocation."" Sowles was fired, but he was dismissed as a defendant in the suit because he was never served with it. Call The Bee's Denny Walsh, (916) 321-1189."\u000a

V"Jesuit baseball coach Joe Potulny agreed that last week was a ""wet and wild one"" for area teams.Some programs had just enough tarp to protect infields from rain and hail and squeezed in games to avoid a four-game schedule this week.Jesuit was No. 2 behind Oak Ridge entering last week's play. The Delta River League rivals flip-flopped in the rankings this week, a fitting turnabout to support what a number of coaches contend are the area's top programs to this point.Last week, Jesuit won two of three tightly played games against Oak Ridge, two coming down to the last at-bat. ""We've got a good thing going (with Oak Ridge), a fun rivalry,"" Potulny said. ""I'm impressed with both teams.""Last Tuesday, Jesuit won the first game 1-0 on a pitching gem by Logan James and a walk-off home run by Andre Gregory. His homer landed over the left-field fence and in the area where his father, Quinn Gregory, coaches Jesuit's freshman team.In a doubleheader Saturday at Jesuit, Oak Ridge won the opener 3-2 on a seventh-inning sacrifice fly by Cody Uharriet that scored Lance Berringer. Cody Morris slugged a two-run home run for Oak Ridge, and Sacramento State-bound pitcher Alex Fitchett struck out eight for the Trojans.Jesuit won the nightcap 6-3 as the teams combined to use five pitchers and had 11 hits each. Julian Barron earned the win in relief for Jesuit.

During Tuesday night's 44-40 Division I semifinal win over visiting Gunn of Palo Alto, she committed just two fouls.""I told the team that wasn't going to happen again,"" Johnson said. ""I was embarrassed.""With the score 40-40 with just 10 seconds left, Johnson got the ball on the left wing and dribbled right before cutting into the lane. She attempted a runner and appeared to have been fouled. But the officials, who called a loose game, did not blow a whistle.In swooped sophomore Jessica Lauderdale, who continued her playoff heroics. She gathered the ball and alertly went up for a shot right into the defender's arms with 4.6 seconds left, drawing a foul.""I knew based on the way they called the game, Lynette probably wouldn't get that call,"" Lauderdale said.Lauderdale made both free throws, and after Gunn's inbound pass went the length of the court untouched, she was fouled on the Cougars' ensuing inbound play with 1.8 seconds remaining. She converted both free throws to ice the game.""I'm motivated by not wanting to lose,"" Lauderdale said.That attitude has permeated the Kennedy squad, which has rolled to seven straight playoff wins after finishing third in the tough Metro Conference. The Cougars (25-8) have beaten bigger, faster foes and, in beating Gunn (21-7), outlasted a team that entered Tuesday having allowed only 57 points in two NorCal playoff games.

V"We think of branding as something ranchers do to their cattle. But it's also what pimps do to women and girls they control across America. Taz, a 16-year-old girl in New York City, told me that her pimp had branded three other girls with tattoos bearing his name. When she refused the tattoo, she said, he held her down and carved his name on her back with a safety pin. More about Taz in a moment. That kind of branding isn't universal, but it's very common. An alleged pimp indicted last month in Manhattan is accused of tattooing his street name on a prostitute's neck, along with a bar code. He allegedly tattooed another prostitute with a symbol of his name on her pubic area, along with a dollar sign. In each case, the message was clear: They were his property, and they were for sale. Such branding is a reminder that women being sold on the streets in America are  not always, but often  victims rather than criminals. That consciousness is spreading, and we are finally seeing considerable progress in tackling domestic sex trafficking. So far, in 2012, states have passed more than 40 laws relating to human trafficking, according to Megan Fowler of Polaris Project, an anti-trafficking organization. Prosecutors and police are increasingly targeting pimps and johns, and not just the women and girls who are their victims. In Manhattan, the district attorney's office recently started a sex trafficking program and just secured its most comprehensive indictments for sex trafficking. Likewise, a federal prosecutor in Virginia brought sex trafficking charges last month against a man accused of selling a 14-year-old girl in several states. Now President Barack Obama is said to be planning an initiative on human trafficking. I'm hoping that he will direct the attorney general to make sex trafficking a higher federal priority and call on states to pass ""safe harbor"" laws that treat prostituted teenage girls as victims rather than criminals. The other important shift is growing pressure on Backpage.com, a classified advertising website that dominates the sex trafficking industry. Calls for Village Voice Media, which owns Backpage, to end its links to sex trafficking have come from attorneys general from 48 states, dozens of mayors from around the country, and some 240,000 Americans who have signed a petition on Change.org. Resolutions are pending in the Senate and House calling on Village Voice Media to get out of this trade. At least 34 advertisers have dropped Village Voice Media publications, including the flagship, Village Voice in New York City. In its defense, Village Voice Media notes that it screens ads and cooperates with the police. That's true, but Taz  the 16-year-old with her former pimp's name carved into her back  told me that three-quarters of her ""dates"" had come from Backpage. I met Taz at Gateways, a treatment center outside New York City. She told me that she ran away from home in New York City at the age of 14 and eventually ended up in the hands of a violent 20-year-old pimp who peddled her on Backpage. Skeptics mostly believe that prostitutes sell sex voluntarily, while anti-trafficking advocates sometimes suggest that they are almost all forced into the trade. The truth is more complicated. Taz wasn't locked up, and, at times, she felt a romantic bond with her pimp. She distrusted the police  with reason, for when officers found her in December, they arrested her and locked her up for four months in juvenile detention. Yet Taz wasn't exactly selling sex by choice, either. She said her pimp issued his four girls a daily quota of money to earn; if they didn't, he would beat them. They could never leave, either, Taz said, and she explained what happened when her pimp caught her trying to run away: ""I got drowned,"" she recalled. ""He choked me, put me in the tub, and when I woke up, I was drowning. He said he'd kill me if I left."" Another time, Taz says, she tried to call 911. ""He hit me over the head with a glass bottle,"" she recalls. Then he ordered another of his girls to sweep up the broken glass. I bet the police looked at Taz and saw an angry, defiant prostitute who hated them and didn't want to be rescued. There was an element of truth to that. But there's another side as well, now visible, and it underscores the importance of helping these girls rather than giving up on them. Taz is emerging as a smart, ambitious girl with dazzling potential. She loves reading and writing, and when I asked her what she wanted to be when she grows up, she smiled a bit self-consciously. ""I'd like to be a pediatrician,"" she said."\u000a

V"Thursday was a busy day for Franklin High School senior Crystal Vega.There was the 6 p.m. graduation at Power Balance Pavilion, then the post-grad party afterward at an area bowling alley.But there was another piece of business to take care of earlier in the day  helping her Franklin girls soccer team achieve history.The Wildcats defeated Turlock 1-0 in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I semifinals to advance to their first championship final.Franklin (18-4-2), will play St. Mary's on Saturday at Cosumnes Oaks or Lincoln of Stockton. The Rams beat Folsom 2-1 in overtime.Vega is the captain and one of only two seniors on a team that has grown up fast.Franklin beat and tied perennial power and defending D-I champion Davis to win the Delta Valley Conference. In the playoffs, Franklin beat another perennial power, St. Francis, 2-1 and edged Vintage of Napa 5-4 on penalty kicks in Tuesday's quarterfinals.Thursday's game, which started at 1 p.m. to accommodate the graduations of Vega and Ashley Matarelli, wasn't as close as the score indicated.Although junior Tatyana Garrett scored the game's only goal midway through the first half, the Wildcats dominated play against Turlock (4-4-5) with at least a half-dozen near misses on goal.""That was a little frustrating,"" said Vega, who missed several close shots, including a blast that bounced off the far post. ""But we played well. This was fun to be able to make a little bit of history for girls soccer at our school.""Franklin coach Eliseo Lopez enjoys watching his team play.""I didn't think they were going to be this good because we are so young,"" said Lopez, in his eighth season as coach. ""But they have chemistry and they are hungry.""They also have depth.Lopez's junior varsity team went undefeated even though he elevated freshman sensations Lauren Williams and Kyra Taylor to the varsity seven matches into the season.Both made all-Delta Valley Conference, and Williams leads the team in scoring with 23 goals, although the forward wasn't in the lineup Thursday. She was participating in a 5 vs. 5 international tournament in Munich, Germany. But she's expected to fly back to Sacramento early Saturday morning.""I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we'll have her for the championship,"" Lopez said. ""But either way, I think the girls are ready to show their talent."""\u000a

V"The Northern California Regional football championship that debuts this weekend was created to crown the best from the North to play the best from Southern California in CIF State Bowl games.But the leaders of the state's top-ranked team, one with a winning pedigree second to none, questioned the NorCal concept as a bit flawed.When asked what they thought of the NorCal Open game matching the best two teams in the North  De La Salle of Concord against undefeated Folsom  De La Salle athletic director Leo Lopoz offered a thumbs down, defensive coordinator Terry Eidson scrunched his eyebrows and nodded, and veteran head coach Bob Ladouceur sighed.De La Salle certainly doesn't fear Folsom (14-0), its opponent Saturday at Sacramento State in what could be considered the top high school sports event in area history. The Spartans (13-0) have played a national schedule for years and won the last three CIF State Open championships.The De La Salle brass said they think the best two teams in Northern California should each have a shot at winning a bowl game the following weekend in Carson instead of one knocking off the other. De La Salle is ranked No. 1 in the state by Cal-Hi Sports and Folsom is No. 3. The teams are 1 and 2 in Northern California by Cal-Hi and MaxPreps.Meanwhile, Granite Bay (11-3) plays St. Ignatius of San Francisco (10-3) on Friday in the NorCal Division I championship, which means a three-loss team will represent Northern California in a bowl game.No one from De La Salle disputes how far those teams have come or how strong they are, but, ""There's going to be a great team  left home from state,"" Eidson said.Said Ladouceur: ""(After Saturday), one of the two best teams from Northern California is off the board.""Added Lopoz: ""We want the best NorCal teams in the state bowls.""The counter-argument is that the two best Northern California teams should play each other to determine which one takes on the South winner. And Folsom coaches and players are itching for a shot at De La Salle, which last lost to a Northern California team in 1991. De La Salle is 4-0 against Sacramento-area teams (Valley in 1988, El Camino in 1987, Nevada Union in 1997 and 1998) and 31-0 against Sac-Joaquin Section teams since Ladouceur became coach in 1979.Section Commissioner Pete Saco hatched the regional idea and likes the format.""For all the respect I have for coach Ladouceur and De La Salle, it is going to lose sometime,"" Saco said. ""Maybe it'll be in a NorCal Open. That's the fun of this.""Coach Cat steps down  A day after his father, Butch Cattolico, stepped down following a storied 41-year career as coach at Los Gatos, his son also stepped down. Joe Cattolico, the only varsity head coach at Pleasant Grove since the school opened in 2005, told his shocked team Tuesday. He will remain as a social studies teacher.The younger Cattolico, regarded locally as a top-tier coach and person, won four Delta River League championships, reached the D-I section finals three times and won the title in 2010.Cattolico couldn't be reached for comment, but athletic director Jeff Caton said, ""He's tired. Balancing football and family and teaching is hard. I'm not totally surprised ... but it is kind of a blow. He's a great coach.""Said junior quarterback Dre Terrell, ""We love Coach Cat, not just as a coach but as a person as well.""Editor's note: This story was changed Dec. 5 to correct the year that De La Salle beat Valley."\u000a

V"It doesn't matter if Cassidy Denny slams the ball over the net for a kill or dinks it between two defenders. The senior outside hitter for El Camino High School gets the job done.She is the emotional and vocal leader for the young Eagles squad that lost six seniors from last season's Sac-Joaquin Section title team and repeated this year, beating Gregori of Modesto 25-19, 22-25, 25-23, 25-18 in the Division II final Thursday night at the Pavilion at UC Davis.""She is the everything player,"" El Camino coach Marty Soyama said. ""She plays great defense, she hits well, and she led her team tonight. She reminded everyone what the game plan was. She really led the way. I am so proud of her.""Said Denny: ""I feel this is my team. I realized this is my year. I knew we were going to go as far as I wanted us to go, and I want to go to state.""Soyama said the first D-III section title in 2011 was great but feels this one is a little sweeter. ""Last year, we were expected to win,"" Soyama said. ""No one expected us to win this year. So it is a testament to our kids, and they really came together.""Led by Denny and sophomores Devin Herenda and Mikaela Nocetti, the Eagles led 1-0 before Gregori came back in the second set. But with Denny, whom Nocetti says the younger players are ""really going to miss,"" the Eagles won the final two sets with more than just talent.""We have a lot of heart,"" Denny said. ""We struggled, but we pulled it through because we really believe in each other.""Division I  Behind seniors Gabriella Palmeri, Allie Wegener and Loni Kruen, St. Francis won its second straight title, 25-23, 25-14, 25-10 over Granite Bay.It is the 12th section title for St. Francis.""They are all sweet,"" Troubadours coach Alynn Wright said, ""since it is always a different group of girls that have different goals and priorities. For them to achieve those goals is always rewarding.""Division III  In her second year as Oakmont's coach, Shelby Weinberger took the Vikings to the top of the section with a comeback 3-2 victory over Vista del Lago.Down 2-0, the Vikings looked tentative and nervous against the Eagles, who won the past two D-IV section titles before moving up this season.""I think a lot of people were nervous and weren't ready,"" Oakmont sophomore setter Ally Wubben said. ""But this was just another game, and we needed to play our game no matter what.""Vista del Lago took the first set convincingly, and Weinberger said her team was not the same one that went 10-0 in the Capital Valley League en route to a No. 1 seed for sections.""I honestly was thinking we looked nervous as can be,"" Weinberger said. ""I didn't know if we had it to come back, but once we got settled down and got into a rhythm, we said, 'We can do this, and we deserve to be here.' ""After the Eagles took the second set, dissatisfaction set in for Weinberger.""I thought, what a disappointment to come all the way here and not be to prove we deserve to be here because what I saw from my team wasn't my team. It wasn't the team we have built,"" she said.But with a heavy dose of senior Katie Carte, the Vikings came back. They took the third set 27-25 and finished with a 25-18 fourth and a 15-4 fifth. The title is Oakmont's first in girls volleyball.Division IV  Bear River won its third section title with a 25-22, 20-25, 25-19, 25-23 win over Ripon Christian.Division V  Woodland Christian beat Le Grand 3-0 to win the school's second section title.Division VI  No. 3 seed Turlock Christian beat No. 8 Valley Christian in three sets for the title."\u000a

The Pride won its past 27 games, losing only on the road to Florida powers Monteverde Academy and Blanche Ely, nationally ranked No. 15 and No. 18, respectively, by USA Today.Against Price (26-9), Salesian overcame a slow start, then rode the dunks, layups and jumpers of 6-foot-5 forward Jabari Bird, one of the nation's top juniors, and the interior play of 6-8, 305-pound senior center Freddie Tagaloa.Bird finished with 24 points, hitting 10 of 16 shots, and had four rebounds.Tagaloa, a Cal football scholarship signee, had a team-high nine rebounds and two blocks and made all three of his shots while battling Price's 6-8 Skylar Spencer (14 points, nine rebounds) and 6-7 Khalil Johnson (17 points, seven rebounds).La Jolla Country Day 72, Salesian-Richmond 41 in the Division IV girls final  Junior guard Kelsey Plum scored 32 points, including a record-tying five three-pointers, to lead the Torreys (32-1) past the Pride (31-5).

V"Jason Samuels is one of the smart ones of the bunch.The Oak Ridge High School senior quarterback with a 4.0 grade-point average takes care of those who take care of him, specifically the offensive linemen: five big-body sorts who appreciate contact and a chance to belly up to the dinner table.The line has provided protection for Samuels throughout a 4-0 start for The Bee's sixth-ranked Trojans, Oak Ridge's best team since moving up to Division I three years ago and perhaps one of the best in the 30 years of the varsity football program in El Dorado Hills.Samuels has led the way with 731 passing yards, 10 touchdown passes and a quarterback rating of 120. He's been sacked once with one interception  both coming in a 42-6 season-opening rout of Vista del Lago.Since then, his linemen have kept their quarterback's jersey clean.""Oh, I reward those guys,"" Samuels said Tuesday before practice. ""We have them over once a week for dinner. It's the bribe system  tri-tip and good, hearty meals.""Good thing, too, since the Trojans sport an all-you-can-eat brigade of blockers including twin tackles Hekoti and Tuita Chapman, both 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds, center Kareem Ballal (6-1, 255) and guards Jacob Proul (6-2, 275) and Cory Gregersen (6-3, 220).Samuels has excelled like a player eager to make up for lost time. He missed the five-game Delta River League schedule last fall because of a collarbone injury. Watching his teammates compete while he wore a sling hurt more than the actual injury, Samuels said.Since 1990, Oak Ridge has produced a number of fine quarterbacks, including Jon DeVille, Sam Clemons, Chandler Clemons, brothers Sean and Shane Steichen, Vinnie Miroth, Connor Benander and Will Tostenson.Like Samuels, they all threw out of the pro-set in an era of wing-T and spread offenses.At 6-3 and 185 pounds, Samuels could surpass all of them, said Mark Watson, former Trojans head coach (1989-99) who is now the quarterbacks coach. Friday, Samuels threw three touchdown passes in a 42-14 win over Grant, prompting Pacers coaches to suggest he may be the best passer in the Sac-Joaquin Section this season.""Jason's so good, so talented, with great footwork, and he's smart out there  not forcing things,"" Watson said. ""Football means a lot to him.""Sometimes, Samuels concedes, it means too much. Football is a family way of life. His father, Doug Samuels, was a Utah State quarterback from 1978 to 1982, flanked by twin brother James, a tight end.James Samuels has one son, Austyn Carta-Samuels, starting at quarterback at Vanderbilt and another, Kyle Carta-Samuels, starting at Bellarmine Prep High of San Jose.Jason Samuels said he inherited his competitive drive from his father.""I hate to lose,"" Samuels said. ""Pingpong, video, cards, playing dad in hoops. I've gotten better with it over the years, not letting it bother me, but it's hard to lose. It's how I am.""We have a basketball court in our yard, and dad and I go at it. He used to beat me until I was 15. Now I've got him. Now he complains about a quad or something when he loses.""Samuels is a perfectionist in shoulder pads and in front of a computer screen. He breaks down his own film. He critiques himself on incompletions, though he will force himself to appreciate success, too. Samuels also studies Tom Brady of the New England Patriots  everything about him, from his approach to the game to his skills and results.Samuels has a Brady poster on his bedroom wall, and he said he cherishes his ""chalk talk"" two years ago with the late Tom Martinez, the Bay Area coaching icon who helped groom and mentor Brady.Samuels even resembles Brady with the short hair and smile. But unlike Brady, Samuels jokes that he does not have a supermodel on his arm to show off around town in his two-door Hyundai.""Too busy with football for that,"" he cracked.That Samuels was in good spirits days before another big game  Vac-aville  pleased Watson and head coach Eric Cavaliere. To know Samuels is to understand that he has to remind himself of the joys of the game.Samuels said he has put a lot of pressure on himself since the spring to get on the recruiting radar. He understands a scholarship is a rare and treasured opportunity, with less than 1 percent of American high school athletes receiving a full ride. Despite his ideal size and strong pedigree, Samuels is still without an offer.""I got caught up in the whole scholarship thing and pressured myself, but I'm in a better place now,"" he said. ""My dad said to enjoy the season, and others said that, too.""Including Cavaliere.""I pulled Jason aside after practices before,"" Cavaliere said, ""and told him, 'You're not having fun out there, and if you're not going to have fun, then this will not be a good deal for you.'""He's taken it to heart. He's relaxed, loosened up a little, but he's stubborn.""Samuels agreed. He said he wants to study psychology in college, joking he'd make a pretty good case study himself.Editor's note: This story was changed Sept. 21 to add Chandler Clemons to Oak Ridge's line of fine quarterbacks."\u000a

V"SAFETY VALVESIf the 49ers lose safety Dashon Goldson, here's a look at how they might replace him: C.J. Spillman: He is every bit as hard-hitting and aggressive as Goldson, and the 49ers have used him in goal-line and short-yardage situations the past two years. He got a lot of practice with the first-team defense in 2011, when Goldson was shopping himself in free agency and Reggie Smith was hurt. However, Spillman lacks game-day experience and to this point has been more of a tackler/enforcer than a player who understands the nuances of coverage. Darcel McBath: He's a restricted free agent this year who has a history with defensive backs coach Ed Donatell. McBath mostly was limited to special teams last season. But it's noteworthy that when Goldson had to briefly leave a game, McBath replaced him. The 49ers are likely to use the lowest possible tender to retain McBath for one more season. He was a second-round pick by Denver in 2009. Trenton Robinson: The team's 2012 sixth-round pick mostly spent his rookie campaign learning. He garnered high praise from coach Jim Harbaugh at the scouting combine  really, though, when has Harbaugh ever not dunked one of his players in praise?  and showed a nose for the football at Michigan State. He's small for the position (5-foot-9, 193 pounds), which would make for a decidedly short safety tandem with Donte Whitner (5-10, 208). Michael Thomas: He spent last season on the 49ers' practice squad but garnered interest from other squads by the end of the season. Like Robinson, Thomas is sub-6-foot, but as you would expect from a Stanford product, he's also very smart. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio coached Thomas at Stanford and likes him. Other options: The safety position is solid in free agency and the draft, which perhaps is why the 49ers feel secure in allowing Goldson to test the open market. It includes one of the two best safeties in the last decade and a half, Baltimore's Ed Reed, as well as several college players expected to go in the first or second rounds such as Texas' Kenny Vaccaro, LSU's Eric Reid, Florida's Matt Elam and South Carolina's D.J. Swearinger. Matthew Barrows"\u000a

He also paid to have the organization's national education trainer fly in from New York for Monday's session.""He wants to use his profile as a professional athlete to help,"" Palmer said. ""He wants to become a volunteer for the organization and become more active. He really learned a lot today.""Culliver was being interviewed by comedian Artie Lange five days before the Super Bowl when Lange asked him about gay players in the locker room.""No, we don't got no gay people on the team; they got to get up out of here if they do,"" Culliver responded. ""Can't be with that sweet stuff.""The comments were widely circulated and criticized, and Culliver apologized and promised to educate himself on the issues involving LGBTQ youth.Others from the 49ers, including vice president of football affairs Keena Turner and public relations director Bob Lange, also met with representatives from the Trevor Project on Monday.Trevor Project spokeswoman Laura McGinnis said Culliver could become a crisis intervention volunteer or work with programs directed at young people. McGinnis said there was no reason to suspect Culliver, 24, wasn't sincere in his desire to understand and help at-risk youth.""Chris is a young guy himself,"" McGinnis said.

V"NEW YORK  Darrelle Revis is moving closer to returning to action. Whether that's with the New York Jets next season remains to be seen.The three-time All-Pro cornerback addressed being the subject of trade rumors in an interview with Seattle fullback Michael Robinson for ""The Real Robinson Report,"" posted on YouTube on Monday night.Revis said the trade rumors ""definitely hit home."" He also was asked specifically about the possibility of being traded to the 49ers, one team rumored to be interested.""I would just be an addition to help them win that trophy,"" Revis said. ""Would it be awesome? Yeah. My main goal as a player, and I think of all of us players in the NFL, is to hold that Lombardi Trophy up in the air and wear that ring.""Doctors said Revis' rehabilitation from a torn left ACL is ahead of schedule, Jets general manager John Idzik said during a conference call with season-ticket holders. But Idzik wouldn't address Revis' murky contract situation. Revis is entering the final year of his contract and wants to be among the league's highest-paid players. If the Jets believe they won't be able to re-sign him next offseason, they will be more apt to try to get something  presumably high draft picks  for him in a trade.Raiders  Offensive lineman Mike Brisiel has restructured his contract to give Oakland salary cap relief.Brisiel converted $3 million of his $4.35 million base salary into a guaranteed roster bonus paid next week, agent Jeff Sperbeck said.Meanwhile, the Raiders didn't use the franchise tag on any of their 17 prospective unrestricted free agents.The decision doesn't mean the Raiders aren't interested in bringing back some or all of those players.They have until March 12 to reach deals with key players such as linebacker Philip Wheeler, tight end Brandon Myers and defensive lineman Desmond Bryant before other teams are allowed to make offers.Ravens  Given the going rate for successful quarterbacks, Joe Flacco knows his status as the highest-paid player in NFL history may not last long, and he's OK with that.The Super Bowl MVP signed his new contract worth $120.6 million over six years. He will receive a $29 million signing bonus, $52 million in guaranteed money and $51 million over the first two years of the deal.""I know that this isn't going to hold up for that long, but that's not a priority of mine to be the highest-paid guy,"" Flacco said. ""The priority of mine was to get that respect that I felt, that I feel now from this organization.""Cowboys  Linebacker Anthony Spencer, Dallas' sack leader last season with 11, received the franchise tag, designated at $9.6 million, for the second straight season. Chiefs  Kansas City agreed to a five-year contract with wide receiver Dwayne Bowe. The Contra Costa Times and Kansas City (Mo.) Star contributed to this report."\u000a

V"GLENDALE, Ariz.  Spring training often brings bold proclamations from players who say they can better their output from the previous season.Matt Cain knows there's no way for him to make any predictions and sound rational.The right-hander is coming off a banner year that included a World Series title, an All-Star Game start and the first perfect game in franchise history.""Yeah, a lot of things went really, really well last year,"" Cain said, smiling. ""If you're trying to sit there and repeat all of that, it's just asking for a lot. Do you want to do it? Yeah. But realistically, I don't think you can be mad if you come up short.""Cain, who threw three innings in Monday's 6-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox, has set a simpler goal for this season, his ninth in orange and black.""I want to make all the starts,"" he said. ""I want to throw as many innings or more than I did (last year).""That may be difficult.Including the postseason, Cain threw 249 1/3 innings last season, the most by a Giants pitcher since 1978. If he can throw at least 200 regular-season innings again, Cain will be the first Giant with seven consecutive 200-inning seasons since Juan Marichal's streak of 10 (1962-71).Despite the heavy workload, Cain, who has transformed his body over the course of his career, said he didn't feel the need for extra rest this offseason. The routine was the same as always, even if it started later than usual because of the postseason.""It definitely went by quick,"" Cain said of his offseason. ""All of a sudden, you turn around, and you're working out again, but you're prepared for it.""Cain said topping last season will be tough, but there is one honor he will garner this season for the first time. Cain already has been named the Opening Day starter, which made Monday's outing against the Chicago White Sox a strange one. Because Ryan Vogelsong is on a strict schedule to prepare for the World Baseball Classic, Cain was brought out of the bullpen for the first time since 2006. He gave up three hits and two runs in the fifth.""I'm glad we let him start in the playoffs and didn't bring him out of the bullpen,"" manager Bruce Bochy joked.Vogelsong was charged with three earned runs in three-plus innings in his final appearance before joining Team USA."\u000a

V"The subject of California's first Silver Alert, an 82-year-old Elk Grove man who went missing, was found early Wednesday in Grass Valley.Robert Grappi relies on regular medication and has shown signs of dementia, according to Officer Christopher Trim, Elk Grove Police Department spokesman.Grappi left his Elk Grove home about 3:30 p.m. Monday after arguing with his wife. He was believed to be driving his 1998 Toyota RAV4 to his son's house in Nevada County, but he never arrived.Police knew Grappi's credit card was used twice at Grass Valley gas stations early Tuesday.Grappi was found about 3 a.m. Wednesday by Grass Valley police after they conducted a vehicle stop. He was checked by ambulance workers and given a clean bill of health before being returned to his family, police said.Grass Valley police first suspected Grappi was driving under the influence when they spotted his vehicle. Once an officer had a chance to speak with Grappi, it was discovered that he was reported missing from Elk Grove.""He was very cooperative,"" and was picked up by a relative at the Police Department, said Capt. Rex Marks with the Grass Valley Police Department.Starting Tuesday, the California Highway Patrol began issuing bulletins called Silver Alerts in cases when at-risk people 65 and older are missing. The Grappi notification was distributed to authorities and media outlets in Sacramento, Placer and Nevada counties about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.However, Grappi was not located because of the new Silver Alert, police said. Finding him had more to do with an observant officer in a small town seeing someone driving in a manner that suggested he was under the influence.""We are a small community and at 3 a.m. pretty much anything that is moving is suspect,"" Marks said. ""Fortunately, he was found safe and sound.""Marks said Grappi indicated that he was ""visiting the high country"" and that he was lucid at the time.""Obviously he was very fatigued, quite tired,"" Marks said. ""He was quite happy to see our officers.""Unlike Amber Alerts, the decade-old system used to locate missing children, Silver Alerts do not appear on electronic highway signs.The CHP issues alerts based on several criteria, including health risks, inclement weather, suspicious circumstances or other perilous conditions."\u000a

Not one stands 6-foot or taller. Not one is generating even a sliver of college recruiting interest, yet the sled yields, moved over yards of terrain, lifted high into the air.If not for the fences that surround the school grounds, the linemen might drive that sled up and down Elk Grove Boulevard.""Hammerheads, it's who we are and it's a way of life,"" explained Herd senior Casey Whalen, a 5-9, 200-pound left guard and a team captain. ""It's great to be a lineman, and it's great to know you don't have to be the biggest guy to succeed.""Only right tackle Marcus Worthy and left tackle Jaime Cruz tip the scales at more than 240 pounds for the 2-0 Herd. The others  right tackle Noah McMahon, center Matt Loller, tight end Noah Letuligasenoa, and ""Z"" or ""X"" down-field blockers Mikey Wright and B'won Canada, weigh between 175 and 205 pounds.""Great motors,"" is how Elk Grove line coach Moe Loller describes his group.The Hammerheads may not pass the initial eye test, but results do not lie. And the sled work pays dividends, ingraining fundamentals and maximizing conditioning.Elk Grove is ranked No. 2 in Northern California by MaxPreps.com, still achieving as a wing-T running juggernaut. Herd tailbacks credit the linemen for their success.Elk Grove opened the season with a 35-21 victory at Lincoln of Stockton (No. 1 in the Sac-Joaquin Section and No. 2 in NorCal in preseason rankings) and last Friday followed with a 48-0 rout of a 2011 playoff team, Beyer of Modesto, rushing for 497 yards behind backs Robert Frazier and Wadus Parker.That rushing total against Beyer was the highest by the Herd since the 1998 section Division I title game against Atwater, when they went for 577. Fullback Lance Briggs, now a seven-time Pro Bowl linebacker with the Chicago Bears, ran for most of those.Elk Grove was 14-0 that season, setting national records on offense and considered one the best teams in section history. Chris Nixon was the offensive coordinator for the Herd in 1998 and is the head coach now. He remains loyal to the linemen.""Got to love the Hammerheads,"" Nixon beamed.But Hammerheads? The origin of the name dates back to Sacramento State in the early 1980s, when coach Bob Mattos employed a power run game.Loller was a Hammerhead on Sac State's last playoff team in 1988. Dave Hoskins, a Hornets coach for that '88 group, brought the Hammerhead mentality to Elk Grove in 1997 as co-head coach.Loller coached for eight years in the Elk Grove junior youth program, proclaiming, ""You're never too young to be a Hammerhead."" Many of his former youth linemen play under him now at Elk Grove.Nixon, a UC Davis wide receiver in the 1980s, admits it's tough to use a Sac State-born moniker.""I had no choice,"" Nixon said. ""The two most important people in my life right now are my line coach and my wife, Tina, and she's a Hornet, too.""Nixon studies every lineman on the sled. He'll bark, 'Hips! Hips! Hips!"" to remind them of their form, and he'll stop the group to go over footwork.Blocking, Nixon and Loller insist, is as much technique and execution as it is talent.""It's not brute strength and a lot of slapping around in there,"" Nixon said. ""It's leverage, technique and feet. At home, my family watches vampire movies and I'm watching 17-year-olds on the sled. It's who I am.""Loller still looks the part of a Hammerhead, thick-bodied and calves to match. Center Matt Loller did not inherit his dad's body type. The son looks more linebacker stout, but they share the same passion.""I'm a big guy trying to get little, and we have smaller guys trying to get bigger on our line,"" Moe Loller said. ""The sled benefits everyone  . I'm very impressed with my son. It's been so fun to watch.""The only lineman with a long face these days is guard Michael Tsukamoto. Although he hasn't been able to play, he has watched every practice until today, when he will have surgery for a broken collarbone. He was injured in a preseason scrimmage.On Tuesday, he admitted to suffering from withdrawals.""What do I miss the most? The sled,"" Tsukamoto said. ""I'm crazy like that."""\u000a

V"The Natomas Unified School District board is expected to vote Wednesday night on whether the district should shell out incentive money to teachers willing to give notices of their resignations before the end of March.Early notice from teachers intending to retire or leave the district before the next school year allows the district to send out fewer preliminary pink slips in March and final pink slips in June, according to a staff recommendation.School districts are required to send out preliminary pink slips in the spring to any teacher who may be laid off at the end of the school year. The March deadline, however, falls well before the state has finalized its budget, so districts usually have to send out far more preliminary layoff notices in March than final notices in June.Sending fewer pink slips improves staff morale, enables the district to keep quality recent hires and improves the efficiency of the school staffing process, according to district information.District staff are recommending that employees who submit an ""irrevocable notice of retirement"" by 4 p.m. March 7 receive $2,500. If teachers submit the same notice between March 8 and March 29, they can receive $1,250.The meeting is set for 7:15 p.m. Wednesday at district headquarters, 1931 Arena Blvd., Natomas."\u000a

V"Niel Valmores and Ana Burch have been through a lot together.They've played basketball on the same team since the sixth grade, and they have been four-year players and senior leaders this season for Christian Brothers.For the first three years, they saw their seasons end in disappointment in the Sac-Joaquin Section semifinals.But when they made it to Friday's championship game at Sleep Train Arena, they were not going to be denied.With Burch and Valmores playing their best at the end  and with a dominating all-around performance from junior teammate Alicia Gonzalez throughout  the top-seeded Falcons held off No. 2 Vanden 61-56 for the Division III title.After Vanden tied the score 47-47 on Toni Taylor's two free throws with 4:05 to play, Burch, Valmores and Gonzalez hit consecutive baskets and then outbattled Vanden in the final two minutes.""It took awhile to get used to the atmosphere and being here for the first time,"" said Valmores, who scored 15 points and committed only two turnovers against Vanden's fast and furious defensive pressure. ""But I think in the fourth quarter we buckled down.""Burch, a 5-foot-5 scrapper, grabbed an amazing 12 rebounds and scored seven points while Gonzalez had a game-high 18 points and eight rebounds.Mariah Williams led Vanden (27-4) with 17 points, Taylor had 16 and Kayla Blair seven points and 13 rebounds.It was a wild and physical game with bodies flying and hitting the floor  something one might expect from two programs that had won one girls section basketball championship between them.Both teams shuttled in players like a hockey team. The Falcons (24-7) played 12 and Vanden 11, so the pace was never slow. There were 51 turnovers and 44 fouls.""I embrace physical, by the way,"" Burch said. ""I'm so proud of my team and how far we've come.""It was Christian Brothers' second section title. The Falcons won a D-IV crown in 2008 in coach Ron Gully's first season.The second one was pretty special for Gully because the Falcons overcame several early injuries, especially the loss of Valmores. She missed seven games, five of them losses, because of a concussion.Now with everyone healthy, Gully thinks his team can contend for CIF Northern California and state championships.""These guys have a great balance of experience and youth,"" Gully said.

Two burglaries were successful. One was interrupted, and the other was an attempted break-in, according to a Police Department news release.Intruders entered through unlocked sliding doors and bedroom windows. Stolen items included laptop computers, jewelry, cash, cellphones, electronics and credit cards.The interrupted burglary occurred about 4:30 a.m. Sunday. Police said the victim briefly saw an intruder leaving through an open window. No information on the intruder was available.Police encourage residents to make sure all windows, doors, garages and side gates are closed and locked when not in use. They advise people to keep their doors locked when they are home and especially at night when they sleep. Burglars have consistently targeted unlocked entry points, police said.Residents also are urged to report suspicious activity, such as people walking or driving up and down the street, checking for unlocked doors, or looking in windows, backyards or vehicles.Vehicles cruising a neighborhood at very slow speeds, or people sitting in a vehicle for an extended period can be signs of suspicious activity, police say.Anyone who sees such activity is urged to call 911 from home phones or (530) 758-3600 from a cellphone.Police also recommend that residents inscribe or engrave their driver's license numbers on valuables and keep a record of serial numbers on all personal electronics, computers, cameras and gaming systems to aid in recovering stolen goods."\u000a

V"Patrick Patterson describes himself as a movie fanatic who  gasp  enjoys doing homework. He earned a college degree in three years, for instance, by cramming extra courses and summer semesters into his basketball schedule. His interests are global and eclectic, and include reading a good book, playing video games, dissecting 1980s game tapes and evaluating films nominated for Academy Awards.The son of retired Navy veterans, he is a combination of new age and old school. Hakeem Olajuwon is his favorite player. Quentin Tarantino is his favorite filmmaker. Though pleased that Tarantino won best original screenplay for ""Django Unchained,"" Patterson was disappointed the film failed to win for best picture.""Django,"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and then ""Argo,"" the backup power forward said after his Kings home debut Sunday at Sleep Train Arena. ""That was my list, in order.""Patterson, the key acquisition in the trade that sent rookie Thomas Robinson to the Houston Rockets, arrives with an intriguing portfolio that includes a close relationship with DeMarcus Cousins.Patterson traveled extensively until his parents retired in Huntington, W.Va., when he was in middle school. He was a Cub Scout, a good student, a standout athlete and something of a local sports historian. He recalls being enthralled by stories about prep legends Jason Williams and Randy Moss, teammates who starred at a high school 50 miles away.There is plenty more in the portfolio. There is his size (6-foot-9) and length. There are his considerable basketball skills. There is his reputation as a consummate pro. The Kings envision Patterson, 23, as a backup power forward who can space the floor with his deep shooting, set screens and improve the team's woeful defense both on the wings and in the interior.The only rap on the Washington, D.C., native is a subpar rebounding average. Despite his long arms and lithe but powerful physique, Patterson averages fewer than five rebounds per game. In their introductory conversation, Kings coach Keith Smart immediately challenged the third-year pro to boost his numbers.""He can be a much better rebounder,"" Smart said. ""There's not a lot of wasted motion in what he does. And for a guy who had his best (season), to come to a team, and he's coming off the bench  that's a cause for moping, to be upset and mad. But he has come right in and said, 'Hey, whatever I need to do.' ""In his home-court debut against Charlotte, Patterson hit a three-pointer, had two rebounds and set several forceful screens in his 16 minutes, and he did not contribute to the Kings' habit of overdribbling and ignoring open teammates.His presence in the locker room afterward was perhaps even more impressive: He aimed several playful but pointed jabs at Cousins, seated a few feet away.""He's just a big baby,"" said Patterson, a junior during Cousins' only season at Kentucky (2009-10). ""He shows that rugged face, that frown, but he's just a big kid.""Patterson went on to praise his teammate for continuing to reshape his physique, and suggested the center's improved conditioning has enhanced both his agility and stamina. Then, in a booming voice that carried throughout the room, he added: ""You look like a grown baby over there! How about getting some abs?""""I don't need abs,"" Cousins countered, while pinching his waist. ""See?""""Yes, you do!"" Patterson insisted.The banter continued for another five minutes. Patterson, teasing, smiling, unrelenting. Cousins, listening, grinning, not appearing offended.""We called him 'Grandpa' at Kentucky because he was older than most of us,"" Cousins said, ""and he gave me a lot of grief. He was always messing with me. But he kind of took me in, too. We did a lot of stuff together  dinner, movies. He'll be great to have around, and he's a good player. He can really help us.""The Kings didn't acquire Patterson so he could schedule play dates with the turbulent, immensely talented Cousins, but the locker room desperately needed a shake-up. Players on losing teams tend to be grouchy. And who knows? The brooding Robinson and the visibly discouraged Aaron Brooks, two recently departed Kings, might be invigorated and become more productive elsewhere.But Patterson's upbeat personality already is a welcome addition. Though initially ""shocked"" by the trade and the reality of moving from a contender to a franchise with an evolving roster and an uncertain future, he is embracing his environment, eager to further his career.""It's not a new start, not a new beginning,"" he said. ""It's just playing basketball, and being on the team with guys I've known makes it easier."" Call The Bee's Ailene Voisin, (916) 321-1208."\u000a

V"He's still the same man.The hearty handshake, the passionate narratives on players past and present, and embracing a plan. That's the Brian Katz package.The first time meeting Katz was in 1988 when he was coaching Center High School. In a short time, he elevated the new school into a regional basketball power. Now in his fifth season at Sacramento State, Katz sports a bit more gray, and the look of fatigue can be tied to his unshakable habit of getting up every morning at 4 in his quest to build the Hornets, who are on the cusp of history.Sac State (14-13) is a win from tying the program's Division I-era (since 1991) record for victories in a season. ""We're so close,"" Katz said of becoming a good program at a school known for losing.And Katz's good cheer masks some of the misery he has endured at Sac State.Losing scars coaches. The Hornets have trotted out a wounded lot of coaches through the decades. Since the program's inception in 1948, none of the previous 12 coaches left with a winning record.Katz is 42-100, seemingly always in an uphill climb to foster momentum. He has agonized over every setback, including four one-point losses this season.""Oh, this job can reward you, humble you and punish you,"" Katz said Monday. ""When I first took this job, people told me, 'You're crazy. It's the worst Division I job in the country.' And that's the beauty of it. You make something of it at a great school in a great city. I have no regrets.""Sac State isn't the worst gig, but it doesn't help the Hornets to have the most meager facilities. For all its charm, the 1,200-seat Nest is light years from a D-I look or feel. It's completely inadequate, but Katz never wavers. He works with what he has. Dick Vitale is not going to walk through those doors.""This is my world: We have a great group; we're a win away from something special,"" Katz said. ""People want to talk about the lack of an arena, and it's fair, but we are who we are. Our mantra is, 'We have two rims, one ball. Who's the better team? No excuses.' I'll tell a recruit on the phone that if the gym is an issue, we can get off the phone.""Katz also feels the vibes that the Hornets don't recruit Sacramento nearly hard enough. Not so. Katz has every name player in the region on his radar.He landed a sleeper last year in Cody Demps, a 6-foot-4 guard from Pleasant Grove in Elk Grove. He is the team's sixth man as a freshman and an honors student majoring in engineering. Area blue chippers generally leave town, in all sports, and that's why Sac State's roster includes players from Southern California.""Sacramento basketball has become so good, and I don't want to say it's become too good for us, but the best players are going to go to the high-major programs,"" Katz said. ""I understand that. We still want to evaluate all of the local players. We want high-major players, too. But how many high-major guys turn down a high-major for a mid-major? Never.""With perhaps one exception. The region's top center is Eric Stuteville of Casa Roble, Katz's alma mater. The 6-10 Stuteville said he will attend Sac State on scholarship because he wants to share Katz's vision and wants to study kinesiology.""I love coach Katz, I really fit there, and for some guys, a (mid-major) is the right place,"" Stuteville said.Said Katz, ""I can't begin to tell you how fortunate we feel to have him, the biggest sleeper on the West Coast. I'm not going to tell you that he's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but he's really, really good.""Stuteville is one of the rewards Katz was talking about. Katz guided state-ranked teams at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton over 15 seasons, averaging 23 wins a year. Now another great reward looms: a Big Sky Conference tournament invite. With two games left, the Hornets are 8-10 in conference and jockeying with five other teams for the final four spots in the seven-team tournament.""You've got to really enjoy doing this, because at this level, it's fierce,"" Katz said. ""I'm more into this now than ever. Can't wait to get to work. I get up every day at 4, whether it's Sunday or Thanksgiving, or Saturday in July because I'm ready to go."""\u000a

V"One of the city of Davis' busiest wells has been shut down after crews found extraordinarily high levels of manganese in the water.City officials said it could be summer before the well is operating again  at a cost of $2.6 million.City engineers measured manganese levels in city Well 30 on Davis' west side at 1,700 parts per billion, far exceeding the maximum 50 parts per billion allowed in drinking water, city utilities officials said Monday. The manganese level soared again in follow-up tests to as high as 2,400 parts per billion, said the city's principal engineer on Tuesday. ""It's been creeping up in manganese,"" Dianna Jensen said of Well 30, but added that a 2,400 ppb reading was still ""a bit of a surprise.""But the timing of the city's decision to shut down the well, days before Davis voters decide the future of the city's water supply in a special Tuesday mail-in election, has stoked both sides of the contentious issue. Opponents on Wednesday attacked the city's decision as a conveniently timed ploy to scare residents and influence the Tuesday tally.""We think it's very suspicious that city staff shut down Well 30,"" said Michael Harrington, a Davis attorney and a chief opponent of Measure I. ""We think they're manipulating the water supply system,"" Harrington said. ""It's a scare tactic.""Davis' Measure I asks Davis voters to proceed with a multimillion-dollar plan to join with Woodland to draw and treat water from the Sacramento River. The estimated $245 million Surface Water Project is slated to provide a combined 30 million gallons a day to the two cities  12 million gallons a day for Davis, 18 million for Woodland  to supplement the cities' groundwater. One of the city's highest-producing wells and responsible for more than 10 percent of Davis' water supply, Well 30 is also the highest-producing well on Davis' west side, pumping some 2,300 gallons per minute in the high-demand summer months, Jensen said.City water officials have been watching Well 30's manganese levels for some time, inspecting the well quarterly for contamination since 2008, Jensen said, far more frequently than state mandates requiring inspections once every three years.Manganese is a required nutrient, according to the California Department of Public Health, but at very high levels can pose a neurotoxic risk, particularly to children, according to the department.The well near Lake and Covell boulevards is one of 20 wells in a city that relies solely on groundwater. It's also the second of the city's six deep-water wells forced to shut down. The other is inoperable because of structural damage, Jensen said.Measure I proponents seized on the timing of the troubled Well 30's shutdown this week and earlier water woes, saying it proves the need for the water project.""The intermediate-level aquifers are failing. Now we're seeing deep-level aquifers have contamination as well,"" said Elaine Roberts Musser, chairwoman of the city's Water Advisory Committee and a main proponent of Measure I and the water project. ""We need to diversify our water portfolio. You can't keep relying on well water,"" Musser said. ""What do you do if in the summer peak time you have to shut down a well?""While Davis works to answer that question, the measure's opponents say the project is too expensive  Davis' share of the costs is estimated to exceed $100 million.They say Davis leaders haven't fully explored other less-costly options including working a water delivery deal with West Sacramento or a regional water plan with Woodland, West Sacramento and UC Davis.Supporters say the project would ensure that Davis has a clean, long-term water supply while saving millions of dollars by joining forces with Woodland to comply with state clean-water requirements. Meanwhile, treating and reopening Well 30 will be a costly fix. Jensen estimated the cost at $2.6 million.Meanwhile, Davis is mulling its options.Davis has an agreement with UC Davis to pull water from university wells if needed. The city may also be able to apply for a permit to use the well on a very limited basis, Jensen said. City staffers will soon talk with state Department of Public Health officials to determine the next steps.In the interim, Jensen said Davis will have to fall back on lesser-quality wells, including wells with higher levels of selenium and other materials, she said.""What it means for us is that we will be using wells that are lower down the list,"" she said."\u000a

V"PHOENIX  Sean Doolittle's sharp rise from Class A to the major leagues last season showed a knack for fast learning from the first baseman-turned-relief pitcher. But apparently that doesn't apply to everything.As a last-chance offseason getaway before ramping up preparation for spring training, Doolittle and fellow A's relievers Jerry Blevins and Ryan Cook went on vacation to the Central American nation of Belize. They stayed on the beach, took water taxis into the city, snorkeled and visited Mayan ruins.Doolittle and Cook also took a day to go fishing on the open water, with Doolittle's brother, Ryan, a pitching prospect in the A's organization.Ryan Doolittle, Cook said, ""kept pulling fish out of the water like it was going out of style.""And Sean?""He was the worst,"" Cook said. ""I think we gave him credit for 1 1/2 fish. We threw one of them back.""Doolittle didn't even take credit for the half, saying, ""I only caught one.""So it doesn't quite stand up to the true fish story that was Doolittle's 2012 season, when the left-hander, whose position-playing career was derailed by injuries, emerged as one of the key members of the Oakland bullpen after joining the team in June.Doolittle, who started the year at Advanced-A Stockton, went 2-1 with a 3.04 ERA in 44 games for the A's, striking out 60 hitters and walking 11 in 47 1/3 innings. Among American League relievers with at least 40 innings pitched, his 5.45 strikeout-to-walk ratio ranked fifth.A's manager Bob Melvin calls Doolittle ""one of the great stories in baseball last year.""Now the question is, what Doolittle will do for an encore? To start, the A's are monitoring his workload closely this spring after Doolittle threw 72 1/3 innings across all levels in his first season of professional pitching. He has pitched just once in their first nine Cactus League games.""We want to monitor and make sure, because there's no track record with him as far as innings,"" Melvin said. ""But our training staff does a great job of monitoring these guys. To this point, knock wood, he's handled everything.""Doolittle said he was ""surprisingly nervous"" before his first spring outing  one scoreless inning last Friday. He was happy with his fastball location and, perhaps more pertinently, mixed in three changeups and two sliders.Doolittle blazed through the A's system last season largely on the strength of his fastball, which he threw on average at 93.6 mph in the majors, according to the analytical website FanGraphs.It could be quite a weapon coming from the left side, and Doolittle relied on it heavily, throwing it on 86.8 percent of his pitches.""That was what I would use to get ahead in the count, and then once I got ahead, I would use it to expand, elevate, try to get them to chase, bust them in,"" Doolittle said. ""It was just the pitch I had the most confidence in.""Developing that confidence in the off-speed pitches is an emphasis this spring. He has tightened the break on the curveball he threw last season to make it more of a slider.Pitching coach Curt Young said the hope is it can be more of a swing-and-miss pitch for Doolittle, particularly against left-handed hitters.""But I mean, I'm still going to attack with the fastball,"" Doolittle said. ""I'm still going to move it around the strike zone like I did last year. I don't think it's any secret that's still my bread and butter.""Doolittle said he didn't reflect much over the winter on his whirlwind rookie year. Cook and Blevins said the A's surprising playoff run didn't really come up in Belize either. Now that Doolittle is back in camp, though, the differences for him aren't so easily cast off.""(Last spring), I was trying to prove to people that I could be a good pitcher, not just a good pitcher for a guy that used to be a hitter,"" he said. ""It's hard to believe that one year ago I was here, and then, first cuts, I was out of here. To think about it like that is crazy."" Call The Bee's Matt Kawahara, (916) 321-1015."\u000a

""Educating people is important. If you know what you are up against, you know what your alternatives are.""Galt Police Chief William Bowen approached the six-school district with the idea after ongoing conversations about school security.Concerns were heightened following the shooting deaths of 20 students and six teachers in December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.In the months following the Newtown shooting, communities across the nation have discussed how to prevent similar tragedies on school campuses. Many proposals that have come forward have underscored bitter divisions in the post-Sandy Hook gun control debate.Some have called for tighter regulations, while others, such as the National Rifle Association, have argued for armed guards outside every school.Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Twin Peaks, introduced a bill last month that would allow schools to equip staff with firearms. Assembly Bill 202 would train ""school marshals"" and allow them to carry concealed weapons on campus.The California Teachers Association said it opposes any efforts to arm educators across the state. Galt officials said arming school staff isn't a part of their plan.""The intent is to give a basic understanding of different weapons,"" Bowen said.On Wednesday, there wasn't a divisive gun debate inside the Galt City Hall chambers, where the elementary district holds its board meetings. No one spoke against the firearm safety course.Galt elementary district board President Kevin Papineau said his district's plan seems like a common-sense approach to educate teachers on how to respond to a situation should it arise.""I'm glad the chief has brought this to us,"" Papineau said.Galt elementary district Superintendent Karen Schauer said she initially didn't know what to think of the request to train teachers and staff in firearm safety.Schauer said employees told her it was important, as long as it remained voluntary professional development.Bowen said staff time was the only financial consideration, and that the Police Department would help with most other costs."\u000a

V"SANTA CLARA  Dashon Goldson didn't mince words last month when he said he didn't want to be stuck with the franchise tag for a second consecutive year.""I felt that they wanted me to prove myself, and I think I did just that,"" the 49ers safety said as he was cleaning out his locker two days after the Super Bowl. ""So if I was in the position again with the franchise tag, I'd be very surprised.""Goldson got his wish Monday and escaped the franchise tag  it would have meant a one-year deal worth $7.45 million  but it's unknown if the 49ers or any other team will give him the long-term contract he desires.The 49ers currently have $1 million in salary cap space. They will gain $9.75 million more when they trade quarterback Alex Smith later this month, and there would be another $3 million in savings by releasing kicker David Akers, which is expected.Still, the 49ers already have given long-term contracts to several defensive players  Patrick Willis, NaVorro Bowman and Ahmad Brooks among them  in recent years, and there has been little progress yet in the negotiations with Goldson.In the past two years, Goldson has sought a deal similar to the one safety Eric Weddle signed with the Chargers in 2011  five years for $40 million. The 49ers have refused to match that, a stalemate that continues today.San Francisco general manager Trent Baalke would not get into specifics at the scouting combine last month, but he did say this about his free-agent class: ""It's all about value, making sure you get the right value on players. You can't pay everybody, and you certainly can't pay everybody if you're overpaying others.""The 49ers want to work a long-term deal with tight end Delanie Walker, another key contributor last season, who also appears poised to test free agency. They'd also like to re-sign one of their two free-agent nose tackles, Ricky Jean Francois and Isaac Sopoaga.Beyond that, they could stand to sign a defensive lineman, wide receiver or cornerback in free agency. Defensive lineman Cullen Jenkins, released by the Eagles last month, will visit the 49ers today.They also have some pricey contracts to consider in future seasons.Quarterback Colin Kaepernick is signed for two more years and can begin discussing an extension at the end of next season. Cornerback Tarell Brown and defensive end Justin Smith have only one more year on their contracts; wide receiver Michael Crabtree and linebacker Aldon Smith have two seasons remaining.Baalke said the 49ers also were examining contract extensions for a few players.""But it takes both sides to be able to come together on a number,"" he said. ""And sometimes you're able to do that, and sometimes you're not. We're going to work hard at it, be diligent at it, but we're also going to make sure we make good decisions.""Goldson has been one of the top safeties in the league the past two seasons, finishing with nine interceptions during that span and at times acting like a third inside linebacker against the opponent's running game.He was named to the Pro Bowl and, for the first time, the All-Pro squad for 2012.After the Super Bowl, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said Goldson was one of the players who ""deserved"" to be rewarded with a long-term deal. Goldson said he wanted the security of such a contract but would look beyond San Francisco if necessary.""Somewhere, anywhere,"" Goldson said.

V"There will be pain, guaranteed. And sleep deprivation, most assuredly. And nausea, probably. Competing in the Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run, which leads from Squaw Valley to Auburn along the vertically challenging Sierra and across blazing hot canyons, certainly will not be easy this weekend for a back-of-the-pack runner such as Randy Van Dusen. But the 37-year-old Sacramento police officer vows to keep running, walking, crawling  whatever it takes  to finish under the 30-hour time limit. Part of what will keep him going all day and through the night on Saturday and into Sunday morning is the thought that his K-9 colleague and man's best friend Bodie will be waiting for him at the Placer High School track to cover the final 0.1 miles.""He's going to be with me on the last lap, whether I have to carry him or he'll hobble along with that peg leg he's got now,"" Van Dusen said. Bodie himself has endured his own physical challenges of late. The police dog was critically injured after being shot during a foot chase with a suspect in a Land Park neighborhood in mid-May. After suspect Lucas Jerome Webb of Chico shot Bodie in the jaw and right front leg, Van Dusen fired and killed Webb.Van Dusen has been told by superiors not to talk about the shooting incident. He's now back at work, though Bodie, who still hobbles in a soft cast encasing his left foreleg, is only making community relations appearances until his wounds heal. But Van Dusen will say that his 4-year-old German shepherd has shown amazing resilience after losing so much blood after the shooting that he nearly died. Life for Van Dusen hasn't been easy, either, post-shooting. In talking about nursing Bodie back to health, Van Dusen sounds like a father of a newborn. ""Bodie's given me some sleep deprivation training for Western States over the last month,"" Van Dusen said. ""That's been good, staying up with him. He's now sleeping the night, but it's just hard for me to sleep the night, worrying and making sure he's breathing  just staring at him. He's on a crazy feeding schedule, up at 1 in the morning giving him his dinner. He's lost 10 pounds, and we're trying to get him stronger.""Van Dusen credits trail running  and Western States training, in particular  for serving as a stress reliever this spring. ""There's nothing better than going out after work and running for about a couple of hours, especially trail running,"" he said. ""You're away from everything. You aren't near cars, the city noise. The scenery is beautiful. It clears your mind.""If it weren't for his job as a police officer, Van Dusen probably never would have taken up distance running nine years ago. ""I sat guiding traffic at the CIM (California International Marathon) back in 2003 and watched people go by,"" he said. ""I thought, 'Hey, I could do this.' So, in 2004, I ran it. And I've run it every year since. But, mentally, I'm always looking for the next challenge.""That would be ultrarunning. Van Dusen has completed the area's two most popular sub-100-milers, the Way Too Cool 50K and the American River 50 Mile multiple times. Last summer, he made the jump to 100-milers, finishing Rio del Lago (which loops Folsom Lake, Auburn and Cool several times). That finish qualified him for the Western States 100 entry lottery. Before the lottery, though, Van Dusen received a spot in the race belonging to one of the aid-station sponsors, SacFit, because of another chance on-duty incident, this one occurring at the 2011 Parkway Half Marathon.""I snuck out to the (American River) trail to watch my wife (Lori) run the half,"" Van Dusen said. ""I got flagged down by a runner saying, 'Hey, somebody passed out.' I ran a quarter-mile up the trail. There was a man down. It ended up, he had a blood clot break out of his leg and lodge in his heart. His heart stopped. I gave the man CPR for six minutes. No pulse, no breathing. But then he came back and lived.""The race director was so appreciative that he gave Van Dusen his organization's coveted Western States entry. ""Along with Bodie, that's another reason I want to finish this race,"" Van Dusen said. ""I look at Western States as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's going to be memorable."""\u000a

""At that time I didn't know what downhill and super-G was about, I started speed events later.""Overall World Cup leader Tina Maze, who was trying to become only the third woman to win all five disciplines in a single season, was 0.28 back in fourth spot.Maze had the fastest training run on Thursday and was second-fastest on Friday. The 29-year-old from Slovenia was attempting to join Austria's Petra Kronberger (1990-91) and Croatia's Janica Kostelic (2005-06) as the only women to win in all disciplines in a season.""I was sure I could do that today, but I was too slow on top,"" Maze said. ""At the bottom, I didn't attack like the first days (in training).""She'll get another chance to win a downhill next week at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.While her victory seemingly came out of nowhere, Ruiz Castillo said she has been building up toward it for some time.""There's a lot of training, a lot of work behind that. This winter I've been having some good feelings,"" she said. ""I've been working a lot on my mental strength, that's like working on your technique, your physical preparation, and it's certainly helped me a lot.""Starting late, she had a technically perfect run on the Roc de Fer course.""I felt confident, I was quick in training,"" said Ruiz Castillo, who was third best in Thursday's first training run.Marchand-Arvier made up a lot of time on the second part of the course and then watched as 10 racers failed to match her time. She looked stunned, however, when Hoefl-Riesch also made up time in the bottom section to edge her by 0.01 - ending her hopes of a first World Cup win.Her best remains second place at Lake Louise, Canada, in December 2011. She earned her fourth World Cup downhill podium and fifth overall.Hoefl-Riesch consolidated her second place in the overall standings but remains a massive 858 points behind Maze, having only had three podium finishes on the World Cup this season.""I'm really, really happy with this podium,"" Hoefl-Riesch said. ""Although it's a little bit sad that I didn't win, I was also lucky that I ended up second.""The German skier seemed convinced she had done enough to win, patting her skis several times and giving a thumbs up to the crowd in the French Alpine resort, which was hosting a World Cup race for the first time in 19 years.""That was the first time since a long time that I was coming into the finish in the lead. It was a great feeling to see the green light,"" she said.But Ruiz Castillo, the 28th to start, was well ahead on the first two time splits and kept her pace, bringing a roar of surprise from the crowd and a nod of appreciation from Hoefl-Riesch.""I knew if she was doing the same like she did in training, she can win one day,"" Hoefl-Riesch said.

V"Pyramid Alehouse  a pioneer on downtown Sacramento's K Street when it opened 10 years ago  suddenly closed its doors Monday.But city and business leaders said that could be a good sign for K Street.While the closure of the alehouse caught some City Hall officials and beer enthusiasts off guard, downtown business interests and others said it showed that K Street has finally become a more competitive and attractive district.The 1000 block of K Street  where Pyramid has stood since 2003 on the site of the former Ransohoff's department store  has seen particular progress over the past two years, with vibrant nightclubs, restaurants and a karaoke haunt drawing large crowds to a once-drab stretch.""(Pyramid) couldn't compete,"" said Councilman Steve Hansen, who represents downtown. ""They weren't offering as good a product as their neighbors, and they fell out of favor. This isn't a body blow, this is a good opportunity.""Customers had packed the brewhouse over the weekend, only to be greeted by a sign on the front door Monday announcing the establishment's closure. While no further details were provided on the sign, a Pyramid representative said in a statement that ""business has declined due to economic, social and competitive factors affecting downtown businesses in the area.""""We want to thank all of our Sacramento employees for their hard work and years of service, and the Sacramento community for their patronage,"" said Glenn Hancock.Valerie Mamone-Werder, the business recruiter for the Downtown Sacramento Partnership, said the partnership had been hearing for months that Pyramid might close. In anticipation of that news, Mamone-Werder said, she had spoken to several business owners  including a local independent brewer and an alehouse chain operator  who are interested in the site.""It certainly seems to be popular,"" she said. ""I don't think the falling-out of Pyramid had anything to do with the location.""Mike Costello, owner of the former Brew It Up restaurant downtown, said he was not one of the brewers who had spoken with the Downtown Partnership. However, having heard about Pyramid's closure Monday, he said he was interested in the site as a potential restaurant location.""I think K Street is doing really well, and an independent operator who brings a higher level of authenticity, local sourcing and local craft brews could do just fine there,"" said Costello, whose restaurant at 14th and H streets closed in 2011.Beer enthusiasts were surprised and saddened by Monday's news about Pyramid, which came a day after the popular Sacramento Beer Week festivities concluded.""I can't believe they're closed. We were just here,"" said Amanda Smith, 24, who had visited Pyramid over the weekend for a Beer Week event. ""We had a great time. It looked like it was really doing well, with people partying and just having a good time. And now it's gone.""The downtown lunch crowd was also surprised.Scott Plotkin, a Sacramento retiree, was standing out front of the pub around noon Monday, bemused and shaking his head.""I'm meeting a friend of mine here for lunch, and when he gets here I guess we're going to have to find someplace else,"" Plotkin said. ""I was very surprised. I've been in (the pub) many times, and it was always crowded.""However, Plotkin's friend, Jeff Frost, said he noticed declining lunchtime crowds at the Pyramid Alehouse and other restaurants near the Capitol, dating back to the time of state worker furloughs amid California's budget struggles.""It's been declining for some time; some of the places are maybe half-full,"" Frost said.The stretch of K Street from 10th Street east to the Sacramento Convention Center  has been the epicenter of activity. Still, the former pedestrian mall has large swaths of vacant lots and dreary passages.Work has been slow to start on massive redevelopment projects planned for the 700 and 800 blocks, the two blocks closest to the Downtown Plaza. The projects have been stalled by the sluggish economy and the state's decision to cut off redevelopment subsidies.A music venue, bars, restaurants and 137 apartments are planned for the 700 block. The developer of that project said recently that he aims to begin work this summer. Call The Bee's Ryan Lillis, (916) 321-1085. Read his City Beat blog at sacbee.com/citybeat."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/03/05/5236377/clocks-running-on-arena-talks.html,"Now that Mayor Kevin Johnson has bagged his ""whales,"" the pressure is on Sacramento to make good on the second part of its over-time effort to keep the Kings basketball team.City Manager John Shirey and his arena financing negotiators must come to an arrangement with the deep-pocketed private investors on how to demolish part of Downtown Plaza and replace it with an arena, at a price tag estimated at $400 million.They have only three weeks to get the bulk of a deal done, but officials say they're confident.Unlike last year, when the Kings' owners backed out of an arena deal with the city, both sides are said to be focused on making a deal work, and they already have agreed on basic concepts, said Assistant City Manager John Dangberg.""All parties agree (this time),"" Dangberg said. ""We will be able to put together a substantial set of terms. We will get there.""City officials say they and their consultants and attorneys will begin formal negotiations this week with businessmen Mark Mastrov and Ron Burkle, the two so-called ""whales"" who last week went public with their hopes of buying the Kings and teaming with the city to build a downtown arena.They must decide how much the massive redevelopment effort will cost, divvy up those expenses, come to an agreement on how to share future revenues  and get it all to the City Council in the form of a preliminary ""term sheet"" by early April.In a recent memo to the council, city staffers acknowledged that means most of last year's deal points may no longer be viable. But, the city and the developers are benefiting from extensive research for last year's ill-fated deal.Shirey said an early April return to the council should give the public a couple of weeks for discussions before a council vote on whether to move forward on a project that would reform and redefine a key part of downtown.Sacramento officials say they want a solid arena financing framework submitted to the NBA by mid-April, before the league's board of governors convenes on April 18.The Kings' majority owner, the Maloof family, has signed a tentative deal to sell the team to a Seattle group. That group has a preliminary agreement with local governments there to partner in building a new arena south of downtown. The NBA board of governors is expected to vote to approve or reject the Seattle sale at that April meeting in New York.Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson announced Thursday night during his State of the City address that he is championing a local group led by 24 Hour Fitness founder Mastrov of the Bay Area and Southern California billionaire businessman Burkle to persuade the NBA to nullify the Seattle deal.""With all due respect to Seattle, I absolutely do wish them well and I do hope they get a team someday,"" Johnson said. ""But let me be perfectly, crystal clear. It is not going to be this team. Not our team. No way.""If the NBA nixes the Seattle deal, Johnson said he hopes the Maloofs would agree to sell instead to Mastrov and Burkle. Mastrov submitted his group's bid to the NBA on Friday. Sources say it will be forwarded to the Maloofs as a potential ""backup"" offer.A source with knowledge of the Mastrov/Burkle bid said it is very close to and competitive with the Seattle offer, which values the franchise at $525 million. That implies a $341 million payout for the 65 percent controlled by the Maloofs.But for Sacramento's offer to be taken seriously, the bid must include definitive plans for a new arena, NBA officials said.A major financing question for Sacramento has yet to be resolved: How much money will city officials feel comfortable putting into the mix?In the arena deal last year with the Maloof family, the council agreed to $255 million in city money, most of it to come from a plan to leverage future downtown parking garage revenues.City Council member Kevin McCarty has argued that is way too much money for the city to contribute. Other council members say they are waiting to hear more details from city staff before deciding.City officials say the value of the city's parking assets may be less now than last year's analysis showed. They expect a report back in the next couple of days from a parking consultant. Those results will then be forwarded to the city's financial advisers  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley  which will develop estimates on how much the parking assets are worth.City Treasurer Russ Fehr will also run a risk analysis on the numbers and report his findings and recommendations to the council.The Downtown Plaza location creates a complicating factor for the city. An arena there likely would take out 1,000 of the 2,000 parking spots at the site, officials said, and might force reconstruction work to make the remaining spots usable. The loss of those spots would reduce the value of the city's overall downtown parking assets, officials have said.Seattle officials, meanwhile, are experiencing some drama of their own.An attorney for a longshore and warehouse union has said he will file a lawsuit-ruling appeal Tuesday, seeking to force that city and a private group to redo its environmental analysis for an arena. That group is challenging the choice of south of downtown as an arena site. A Seattle judge threw out the initial lawsuit in February. Union attorney Peter Goldman said he will contend the judge was mistaken. Call The Bee's Tony Bizjak, (916) 321-1059."\u000a

Costs are still accruing, Morain said.The explosion early Jan. 17 inside Snyder's Russell Park apartment in Davis injured Snyder, forced the evacuation of more than 70 residents in the complex and brought bomb units from the Yolo, El Dorado and Placer county sheriff's departments, Sacramento police and the California Highway Patrol.The bomb squads along with the FBI and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives worked for the next 20 hours securing the blast-damaged apartment and removing dangerous chemicals.A bail hearing Friday in Yolo Superior Court revealed that investigators found several common explosives inside Snyder's home, including nitroglycerine and cyclonite, the primary ingredient in the military explosive C-4."\u000a

V"Sacramento police described the crime as ""unimaginable,"" one that likely will haunt a family, a neighborhood and the team of detectives investigating it for some time to come.At the heart of the horrific case is 9-year-old Matthew Raymond Hernandez, who was slain with a hatchet in his family's South Natomas home late Tuesday night.Accused in his killing is his father, 36-year-old Phillip Raymond Hernandez, who was arrested a short time after the gruesome discovery.Even with a suspect in custody, police, like the community, continued to search Wednesday for an explanation that so far is elusive.""So many questions of 'Why?' "" said Sacramento Police Officer Michele Gigante, a department spokeswoman. ""It's just horrible.""The incident began before midnight Tuesday, when Sacramento police received two 911 phone calls from a home in the 2200 block of Atrisco Circle. They arrived to find the boy dead with severe trauma.Officers flooded the neighborhood, and soon found the elder Hernandez about a mile away, walking near Azevedo Drive and El Camino Avenue.According to the police account, Phillip Hernandez went into the backyard earlier that night to get a hatchet and, for unknown reasons, broke through a sliding glass door to get back inside.An elderly woman who lives in the home  described by neighbors as the boy's great-grandmother  heard the glass shatter and ran to the living room, where she found Hernandez armed with a hatchet and standing over his sleeping son, Gigante said.The woman tried to intervene, but the elder Hernandez thrust her aside and began to attack 9-year-old Matthew with the hatchet, Gigante said. The elderly woman witnessed the violence.Matthew's 12-year-old brother was home at the time but was not injured.The boys' mother, Jessica Hernandez, lives out of state and was headed to the Sacramento area Wednesday as the man accused of killing her younger son remained at the Sacramento County Main Jail.From the jail's psychiatric floor, Phillip Hernandez declined to be interviewed by the media. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday.Criminal and family court records document a turbulent history  replete with domestic violence and a bitter custody battle  between him and the mother of his children.According to child custody paperwork, the couple married in January 2001 but separated in April 2004. Three months later, Phillip Hernandez was charged with corporal injury on a spouse and attempted kidnapping, both felonies, Sacramento Superior Court records show. The latter charge was dismissed, but Hernandez ultimately pleaded no contest to the domestic violence charge.He was sentenced to 120 days in jail and five years of formal probation, records show.Phillip Hernandez violated the terms of that probation in November 2005, when he was again charged with corporal injury on a spouse  this time in Yolo County. He was convicted of the charge and was sent to prison.Records from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation show Hernandez served time from July 2006 to October 2007. He was discharged from parole in November 2008.Meanwhile, Jessica Hernandez had custody of the couple's two children. After Phillip Hernandez's release from prison, the two fought over that issue, and ultimately the court imposed an arrangement upon them, family court records show. The children would stay with their mother during the summer, their father the rest of the year, and at alternating homes during holidays.That arrangement was ordered last October. They were scheduled to return to court July 1 for a ""review of parenting, mother's child care and school plans, status of father and his girlfriend and grandmother moving,"" records show.Neighbors on Atrisco Circle said Hernandez, his children and his grandmother had not lived in the home long. Public records indicate they might have moved from Southern California.Karen Hardy, who lives nearby, said her daughter sometimes rode bikes with Matthew. As they set off for school Wednesday morning, Hardy said she had to delicately explain why there were so many police cars in the neighborhood.When she told them the boy's father was thought to be responsible, Hardy said her son and daughter wondered: ""What is wrong with that guy?""""It's just really sad,"" Hardy said from the doorstep of her home.Hardy said her kids talked a little about the tragedy, but seemed shocked, and stayed mostly quiet during the drive. ""It's just crazy when it hits so close to home,"" Hardy said.Less than a mile away at Jefferson Elementary School, where Matthew was a fourth-grader, counselors, psychologists and chaplains gathered to help anyone in need. School staff members called families to alert them that they could get support at the school, if needed.The Natomas Unified School District released a statement that said, in part: ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of one of our students in fourth grade. Our hearts go out to the family and friends.""Reached Wednesday, Jessica Hernandez's brother declined an interview. Attempts to reach her other relatives, and those of Phillip Hernandez, were not successful.Gigante said the family is ""distraught and traumatized,"" and investigators are also deeply affected.""I can see how horrific the scene must have been by how the detectives are responding. As a parent, I couldn't even imagine it,"" Gigante said. ""You don't want to envision it in your mind."""\u000a

Now in its third year under producing artistic director Charlie Fee, the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival this year offers the somewhat problematic ""The Two Gentleman of Verona."" One of the Bard's earliest romantic comedies, the story revolves around intimate betrayals in love and friendship. Best friends Valentine and Proteus fall out over a woman when Proteus dumps longtime gal pal Julia while making a play for Valentine's new flame, Silvia. Eventually, order is somewhat haphazardly and perhaps a little irrationally restored.Fee is also the producing artistic director of the Idaho Shakespeare Festival in Boise, Idaho, and the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, and he has ingeniously figured out how to share productions with his three employers.Performances are on the Warren Edward Trepp Stage at Sand Harbor.

But the pro-democracy activist from Elk Grove vows he won't rest until the citizens of communist Vietnam can speak freely.""For now, I will fight from here. If I have to go back to Vietnam, I will,"" he said Thursday. Nguyen was reunited with his family Wednesday night in Los Angeles after the Vietnamese government deported him, claiming he had confessed to Article 79, ""activities aimed at overthrowing the people's administration.""A champion of nonviolent struggle in the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Nguyen denies he was trying to overthrow the government. He said his three hunger strikes in prison and release without trial reflect the power of peaceful protest. Five years ago, Nguyen was arrested in Vietnam for trying to distribute 7,000 pro-democracy fliers. He spent six months in prison, was convicted and was deported in 2008.How did you learn about Gandhi and King?I was about 12 years old in Vietnam when my stepfather told me about them and what they tried to do. When I came to America from Vietnam in 1990, a lot of countries had turned from dictatorship to democracy based on the beliefs of King and Gandhi. So I read more and thought maybe this would be a peaceful solution for Vietnam.When my wife and I march in Sacramento on Martin Luther King Day, I feel the joy of people power. I had it in my mind that I had to go back to Vietnam, using them as a model.Why go back after you already were jailed there?After my trial I went directly to the judge and asked him when I could come back, and he said in one or two years  just write a letter and he will decide.So in 2010, I legally changed my name to Richard Nguyen, after my mathematics professor in North Carolina, Richard Chandler. With my new U.S. passport, I went to Vietnam in 2011 for six weeks, to research how to make people become good citizens in a democratic environment. In April 2012, I returned. I knew what I was doing wasn't against the law, but I also knew I'd be arrested. I planned to become a witness against arbitrary detention.I landed at 11 a.m., was arrested before noon and was asked if I'm Quan Nguyen. I said ""yes"" and they drove me directly to jail.What did you do in prison?They served me the same food as before  a bowl of rice, some watery soup with a few vegetables and a small piece of fish or meat. But I could survive.I'd do 150 pushups a day. Then I went on a hunger strike and demanded three things: I wanted the books my wife gave the U.S. Consulate to give me. Second, I wanted my documents and some books I'd brought from the U.S. Third, I had to see my lawyers because the investigation was over. I had one official lawyer. I requested two others who also had gone to jail because of their opinions. The law says I'm entitled to a lawyer I trust, but they didn't let me see anybody.Did the hunger strikes work?I wrote a letter to the chief of the jail telling him my legal rights and what I planned to do. In October, I only drank water and on the fourth day they returned the books from the consulate.Then I started a second hunger strike for 12 days. On the third day they returned my books and papers, but I still didn't eat.On the 12th day I filed a legal complaint with the court asking why they didn't provide me with a lawyer. They had 15 days to answer, and when they didn't I started a third hunger strike on my birthday. This time I didn't eat or drink for eight days and almost gave up. I thought I'd wind up in the hospital. Luckily, on the eighth day I finally met my lawyer.What did you hope to prove?I planned to be an example, to show the court and tell the judge that I didn't plan to overthrow anything, but to make the argument that nonviolent struggle is a good way to make things right for the people of every country. They set my trial for Jan. 22, then said they postponed it because the three witnesses against me were on trial in Hanoi. They were among 17 people I was going to train as future leaders.I wouldn't confess to subversion. I did sign a letter saying I wanted to be with my family and friends and they let me out Jan. 30. I know the U.S. government put on a lot of pressure and Vietnamese all over the world talked about it. That gave me strength.Does your release signal a new day for Vietnam?I hope it's a sign that something is changing, that unfair trials should be reconsidered. When Vietnamese citizens do the same thing I did, Vietnamese law treats them differently. It is very wrong when one person's released for the same action (and) someone (else) has to spend 12 or 13 years in jail.How did you survive in jail?I thought a lot about my wife. When you get married, you think you have to relinquish your freedom but with my wife, I have freedom to go to jail. She understands me. She knows my dream.We feel we gain a lot when we choose to lose. I chose to give up freedom to have more freedom. I never think of myself a a hero. I always act as a regular person who wants to do the right thing by my actions. I love democracy and freedom a lot because I live in America. I didn't understand much before I came here. Now I want to pay it back. If I can do that, I feel like I am alive."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/19/5201574/rich-poor-spending-gap-on-schools.html,"America is failing too many of its children in public schools because it doesnt spread the opportunity for a good education fairly to all, according to a report for the government released Tuesday. While some young Americans  most of them white and affluent  are getting a truly world-class education, those who attend schools in high poverty neighborhoods are getting an education that more closely approximates school in developing nations, says the 52-page report by the Equity and Excellence Commission, created by Congress to look into the disparity in educational opportunityA group of leading education experts, the commission said the nation needed to achieve equity in education, both as a matter of fairness and to secure its economic future. It called for changes in the ways that schools are funded.It is only when our nation begins to address the needs of each and every child that we can ensure that America will continue to remain a global leader and innovator, said Rep. Michael Honda, D-Calif., who was a science teacher and principal for more than 30 years, and who sponsored legislation in 2008 that created the commission. This is not a minority issue. This is not a poverty issue. This is an American issue. He and other members of the commission unveiled the report in a conference call with reporters.It found that schools in poor communities in many cases spend thousands of dollars less per student than those in more affluent areas do. As a result, poor schools cant compete for the best teachers and principals, buy the best technology and support rigorous academic and enrichment programs. Ten million students in Americas poorest communities  and millions more African-American, Latino, Asian-American, Pacific Islander, American Indian and Alaska Native students who are not poor  are having their lives unjustly and irredeemably blighted by a system that consigns them to the lowest-performing teachers, the most run-down facilities, and academic expectations and opportunities considerably lower than what we expect of other students, according to the report. Among other things, it recommended higher pay and better work conditions for teachers and principals, and universal high-quality early education. The commission said that the U.S. could afford to pay teachers more, and it argued that raising starting pay to $65,000, instead of todays average of $37,000, and increasing top salaries to $150,000, instead of around $70,000, would help attract better teachers. It estimated the cost of such a pay hike at about $30 billion a year, or about 5 percent of current spending on elementary and secondary education. Commission co-Chairman Christopher Edley Jr., the dean of the law school at the University of California at Berkeley, said the groups work was a long-term project. Even if nothing happens immediately, he said, it was important to kick-start a stronger movement to promote the idea of education equity across the country.The report said that states should adopt finance systems that divided funds equitably, which doesnt mean evenly, the commission said, because some students need more support. It called on the federal government to use incentives to push states in this direction, and for more money for schools with large numbers of low-income students. It also recommended more spending on preschool, to ensure that all low-income children can attend high-quality programs. Only 65 percent of low-income 4-year-olds attend preschool, and many preschools offer only low-quality programs. In his State of the Union speech last week, President Barack Obama said public preschool should become available to all low- and moderate-income 4-year-olds.The commission offered no estimates of the costs of many of its recommendations.Its report was the result of more than two years of meetings around the country with scholars, education advocates, teachers and parents. It held town halls in Kansas City, Mo., Dallas and other cities.Through much debate and deliberation, this report presents a blueprint for how to guarantee that each child has a fair shot at the American dream, Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor of education at Stanford University whos a member of the commission, said in a statement.Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who was on the conference call, said the commission was independent. We asked them to tell us not what we wanted to hear, he said, but to tell us the truth.During the call, Darling-Hammond said California was a microcosm for school financing problems nationwide. The districts that spend the most per pupil spend four times as much as those that spend the least, she said.California Gov. Jerry Browns budget proposal for next year calls for directing more money to districts with many low-income students and English-language learners.I hope thats a sign of what were going to see in other states, Darling-Hammond said. And the federal government can incentivize that by the way it allocates federal funds."\u000a

V"Basketball hall of famer Michael Jordan asked a Georgia court on Monday to dismiss a paternity suit against him, calling it a ""shameless, bad faith attempt to abuse the legal system.""Jordan's lawyer John Mayoue said in a document filed in Fulton County Superior Court that the six-time NBA champion is not the father of Pamela Y. Smith's 16-year-old son. The paternity of the teen was ""conclusively established"" in divorce filings between Smith and her ex-husband, Jordan's attorney wrote.Jordan, 50, is the majority owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats. His spokeswoman Estee Portnoy released a statement to The Associated Press.""Public records show that the paternity of the child was established in a prior case in this same court many years ago and that Michael Jordan is not the father. He also filed a counterclaim seeking sanctions for the false claims made against him. It is unfortunate that well-known figures are the target of these kind of claims. Michael Jordan will vigorously defend himself and his reputation.""In response to Smith's lawsuit, Jordan's lawyer attached a 2003 divorce court filing between Smith and her then-husband Glenville G. Reynolds. The document said the marriage produced one child and listed the boy's birth date and name. At the end of the document, there is a statement signed by Smith saying everything is ""true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.""The filing said Smith will have legal and physical custody of the child and Reynolds can have visitation. Reynolds was expected to pay child support for the child.A telephone listed for Reynolds was disconnected. Smith's publicist did not immediately have a comment on Jordan's court filing.Smith's lawsuit requests Jordan take a paternity test, pay child support and share medical, dental and hospital costs not covered by insurance. She also requested the boy's last name be changed to Jordan, and asked a judge to order the Georgia Department of Vital Records to issue him a new birth certificate.Not much evidence is needed for a judge to compel someone in Georgia to submit to a paternity test, said Randy Kessler, an Atlanta attorney who specializes in family law and is not involved in this case. However, in a case with an established father, it is more difficult because his rights would be affected, Kessler said.The lawsuit requests that any hearing or trial be conducted in closed court to protect the teen's privacy.However, Smith's publicist acknowledged the teen posted a video to YouTube on Dec. 25, saying Jordan is his father and that he wants him to play a larger role in his life.""Pamela had no choice but to support her son and his desire to forge a relationship with his father,"" Smith's publicist, April Love, said in a statement Friday. ""That's why she is now speaking out and prompting Michael to do the right thing.""Love said Smith, 48, and Jordan met in Chicago in the late 1980s.According to court documents, Smith does not have an attorney. A court date is scheduled for March 12.Jordan remains one of the most recognized sports figures in the world nearly 10 years after his retirement from the NBA. He was a 14-time NBA all-star and won six championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named the finals MVP six times.On March 17, 2010, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase of the Bobcats, making him the first former NBA player ever to become the majority owner of a league franchise."\u000a

V"Playwright Laura Schellhardt tells a slick and mysterious little story in her play ""The K of D: An Urban Legend."" The taut narrative is not wholly remarkable, but the telling plays extraordinarily well through vivid characterizations by two virtuosos. In the meticulous new production at the B Street Theatre, Tara Sissom and Jason Kuykendall play the dozen characters of St. Marys, Ohio, where the play unfolds over the course of a summer. Sissom plays ""the girl who does most of the talking,"" which would be the play's narrator, and also skinny Charlotte McGraw ""who no longer speaks"" but is one of the play's central figures. Kuykendall inhabits most of the other characters. The two actors shape-shift before our eyes into a gallery of small-town types who are well-known to each other. Taken as a group they form the insular hermetic community.As Sissom's narrator climbs around Samantha Reno's woodsy poetic lake-dock set, she tells Charlotte's story that begins with her skateboarding twin brother Jamie being accidentally run over by local bully Johnny Whistler. Schellhardt displays a deft hand creating the small-town sensibility among her characters while also building the urban legend mythology out of the commonplace tragedy. The killing is told from various points of view, but everyone agrees Jamie seemed to unnaturally fly through the air after the car hit him; and Charlotte was changed forever after kissing her dying brother.The local urban legend that grows out of Jamie's dying claims that Charlotte kissed him during his last breath and now she has a power  the kiss of death. Soon after the accident, unexplainable odd things begin happening in and around the small town, such as dead animals being found in strange arrangements near the lake. The kids helping to tell the story are a benign pack of bored teenagers thrown together because they live where they live. Quisp Drucker, a mouthy big talker, Becky Ray Voss, a sassy girl who smokes bubble gum cigarettes, and Steffi Post, a comically innocent girl who romanticizes violence, are suddenly galvanized when Whistler reappears in town. There's no mistaking Whistler as the story's villain, and he's drawn in such broad strokes that his character simplifies the dynamics more than he adds tension. Kuykendall is especially effective as Whistler, pulling a dirty baseball cap low over his eyes while darkening the tone of his voice into a throaty sneer.

V"A ""carapace"" refers to the protective shell of a turtle or tortoise. When the idea turns up in a play you can bet it's symbolic of a character's, you know, protective shell. Symbols are tricky, though, and in the new play called ""Carapace"" at B Street Theatre's B3 Series, just who has or needs the carapace never becomes entirely clear.The confusion doesn't completely derail young playwright David Mitchell Robinson's sometimes listless drama, which manages a few bright spots among its too-familiar characters and situations.B Street stalwart Dave Pierini finds himself center stage here as Jeff, a Minneapolis-based sportscaster. Jeff has a drinking problem which has put him in and out of rehab centers, and we assume it busted up his marriage. The carapace may refer to the alcoholic shell Jeff has erected around himself as he makes his way through his disengaged existence.Jeff's drinking has also alienated his now-adult daughter Margo, and the main action of the play follows Jeff on an ill-fated attempt to undo damage he's inflicted on Margo with an intentionally symbolic gesture of reconciliation. One contrivance tilts the story with its weight. Robinson has given Margo a debilitating stutter. Stephanie Altholz is the game actress saddled with the anvil-like device that is central to Robinson's plot but feels an unnecessary gimmick. One could argue that Robinson's machinations put shells around all his characters. Plenty of heavy-seeming stuff happens to them, but it doesn't move us all that much. The actors labor at pulling the play together. There's some uneasy humor through a couple of quirky characters played by the terrific Greg Alexander, and the comedy works better than the drama.Director Jerry Montoya stages a lean, brisk production with an economical set design from Samantha Reno. Playwright Robinson could perhaps use fewer symbols and more complex motivations.The production's most engaging scene involves B Street intern James Arakas, who has an easygoing but sinewy presence. Arakas' Kyle runs a pet store that Jeff rolls into at the last minute trying to buy a tortoise for Margo. Kyle recognizes Jeff from rehab but, deeper still, he remembers how Jeff was then and clearly doesn't trust him with a living thing now. There's tension and conflict in the exchange resulting in a moment of honest urgency from Jeff that we never feel in the rest of the play.CARAPACE  1/2What: The West Coast premiere of David Mitchell Robinson's drama about an alcoholic father delivering a birthday gift to his adult daughter.When: Continues 7 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m. Saturdays; 2 p.m. Thursdays and 1 p.m. Sundays through Feb. 24.

And what a homecoming.Playing in front of a festive, full crowd that included the band, a halftime performance by the Sheldon High School universal rhythm dance crew and a rooting section that featured shirtless seniors with body paint, The Bee's top-ranked boys basketball team entertained in every facet after a whirlwind holiday tour.Sheldon, fresh off national events in Las Vegas, San Diego and New Orleans, didn't look like a jet lagged team. The Huskies raced past and jumped over rival and No. 17 Jesuit 69-42 in a Delta River League game Friday night.Last season, Sheldon beat Jesuit four times. The Huskies won their two DRL games against the Marauders, and then beat them to three-peat as Sac-Joaquin Section Division I champs and prevailed against them in the Northern California D-I final.Sheldon's core returned, headed by San Diego State-bound seniors Dakarai Allen and D'Erryl Williams and forward Ryan Manning. The Huskies looked like a team ranked No. 5 in the state by Cal-Hi Sports and NorCal ranked No. 3 by MaxPreps. They took apart a rebuilding, talented Marauders team that competes but can't quite match the Huskies.""They're really good,"" Jesuit coach Greg Harcos said before the game.Sheldon led 62-24 before the reserves played the entire fourth quarter. The Huskies (11-4, 2-0) ran the floor, shared the ball on alley-oop dunks, hustled on defense and used depth to keep a full step ahead of the Marauders (9-9, 1-1). Sheldon, which last played at home Dec. 8, made 8 of 15 first-half threes.Darin Johnson, a 6-4 forward, led Sheldon with 17 points. Manning had 14 points and six rebounds. Allen had 13 points, five steals and three blocked shots. Williams had seven points and six rebounds, and teammate Antonio Lewis had 10 points and five rebounds.""We shot the ball well, shared the ball, and we're not at our peak,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said.Williams, the steady point guard, said a home atmosphere adds to the total package. Sheldon players hope for a similar crowd today at 6 p.m. when state No. 9 Bullard of Fresno (13-1) visits.""Always love the band here  the best band in the land,"" Williams said. ""We have great atmosphere here  .""As for the holiday tour, Rollings and Williams agreed the Huskies got what they wanted: experience against top-tier teams, a chance to bond away from home, improvement and no injuries.For all of Sheldon's star power, the efforts of the unsung performers also impress Rollings and his staff. Lewis is a 6-foot-1 senior forward who scraps for loose balls and loves to rebound.Sheldon guards James Fox, Jordan Bradley and Devin Greene combined for eight points and a lot of ball handling.""I'm old school  get after it, get the rebounds, play hard defense, hit open shots,"" Lewis said. ""It's my role."""\u000a

V"Baseball is the easy part, a reprieve from the reminders of real life.Davis High School is trying to comprehend another loss to its baseball family. Nancy Hatamiya, the mother of Blue Devils senior catcher and team captain George Hatamiya, died of lung cancer Tuesday. She was 52. A one-time advisory council aid to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, Nancy attended most of her son's games, ignoring suggestions that she rest at home.When George Hatamiya led off Thursday's Sac-Joaquin Section Division I North playoff game against Oak Ridge with a single, he patted his heart.When he scored the first run of Davis' 5-2 victory, Hatamiya recalled her last-hour plea that he continue to achieve.Every time Davis pitcher Ben Eckels struck out an Oak Ridge batter  12 in all  he thought of Hatamiya and Scott Heinig, the Blue Devils pitching coach who died just over a year ago at age 22. Eckels has Heinig's jersey No. 22 stitched into the back of his hat.Heinig was not just a coach to Eckles, but also a mentor and friend. Heinig would raise his eyebrows if Eckels didn't finish his homework in the dugout before a practice.Death is a lot for teenagers to handle, and the Blue Devils are dealing with it by competing.""You get the scope of real life here, with what we've gone through,"" George Hatamiya said after Thursday's game at Sacramento City College, looking upward to compose himself. ""Something allows us to fight adversity. My mom loved watching us play. We were her team. She was a role model for so many, especially to my older brother (Jon) and me. She talked about education, music, sports. Wanted the best for us.""After a moment of reflection, he continued.""We were worried about Mom, and there she was worried about us. This baseball team is my second family. I lost someone in my first family, but I need to be here for my second family, and Mom would want that, too.""Eckels said he admires the courage of Hatamiya, whom he has played baseball with since they were 8 years old.""We need to be out here playing,"" Eckels said. ""It's hard to lose people close to you.""Eckels' extended family also is reminded of another passing each time they attend a Davis home baseball game. The Blue Devils' scoreboard bears the name of Bobby Jones, who died in 1993 at age 18 from leukemia during his senior season. Less than a year later, Eckels was born. He never met his uncle  Bobby Jones.The Blue Devils' annual postseason team banquet includes the Bobby Jones Most Valuable Player award. It might be a co-honor this season with Eckels and Hatamiya. They may also land the John Riggins Most Inspirational honor. Riggins was a Davis scholar-athlete and a childhood friend of Davis baseball coach Dan Ariola. A pitcher, Riggins went 6-1 for Davis in 1980, though he was even better in soccer. Riggins and his UC Davis college sweetheart, Sabrina Gonsalves, were abducted and killed in December 1980, a case that still haunts the town of Davis.Ariola named his son after Riggins. Now a junior, John Ariola is a Blue Devils infielder.""Unbelievable,"" said coach Ariola, summarizing the sad events. ""It's been a lot. It was hard to go through before, and then this last year with Heinig and George's mother  ""It hasn't been easy, but baseball has been the common denominator that has helped Davis' baseball team push forward.""Baseball really helps,"" Dan Ariola said. ""It's their release. It's what they've played all their lives. It's what they enjoy. We have a great parent group here, too, and these players are special. You want to root for this team."""\u000a

V"A broad swath of the nation's leading chief executives dropped opposition to tax increases on the wealthiest Americans on Tuesday, while the White House quietly pressed Wall Street titans for their support as well. Before Tuesday's about-face, the Business Roundtable had insisted the White House extend Bush-era tax cuts to taxpayers of all income brackets, but the executives' resistance crumbled as pressure builds to find a compromise for the fiscal impasse in Washington before year-end. ""We recognize that part of the solution has to be tax increases,"" said David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. ""That's the only thing that allows a reasonable compromise to be reached.""Even as the Fortune 500 leaders announced their shift, the White House continued to work behind the scenes to woo some of Wall Street's most powerful financiers  a group that had largely abandoned President Barack Obama in his bid for a second term after supporting him in 2008. After seeking out corporate leaders from industrial companies last month, the White House intensified outreach to Wall Street. Several hedge fund managers, including Daniel Och, the billionaire founder of Och-Ziff Capital Management, will meet today with Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to the president, and members of the White House economic team. Last Monday, White House officials sat down with more than half a dozen top bankers and financiers, including Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, and Greg Fleming, head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley. The differing strategies  highly public meetings with corporate America and private arm-twisting with Wall Street  both appear to be aimed at winning popular support for higher taxes on the wealthy. The trade-offs being roundly fought over in Washington, such as what government programs might be cut and which entitlements might be spared, are less important in this effort to muster highly compensated chieftains whose support for tax increases will provide cover for congressional Republicans wary of being seen as too quick to compromise on higher tax rates. What's more, the political symbolism of some of the wealthiest Americans' saying they support higher taxes on the rich takes a bit of the sting out of the idea of raising rates for both Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, by appealing to both camps and enlisting their support, Obama hopes to neutralize potential critics, according to allies of the president on Wall Street. Obama's supporters cited the example of Frederick Smith, the chief executive of FedEx. Last week, Smith signaled he was not angered by higher tax rates for the wealthiest individuals, a centerpiece of Obama's plan to reduce the deficit and a key sticking point for Republicans in Congress."\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2010/12/15/3260085/us-sues-bp-transcoean-anadarko.html,"WASHINGTON  BP and other companies not only ignored important safety and operating regulations, the Justice Department said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday, but also failed to take necessary precautions to keep BP's Gulf of Mexico well under control before the April 20 blowout that killed 11 people.While the full scope of the disaster isn't yet known, the Justice Department wrote in its suit, ""the consequences include lost lives, destroyed livelihoods, and grave harm to natural resources across several states and related waters."" The lawsuit, the first phase in punishing the parties responsible for the spill, could wrest billions of dollars in civil penalties from nine companies the Justice Department blames, including BP, for allowing an estimated 4.1 million barrels of oil to gush into the Gulf of Mexico over three months. Because each barrel spilled carries a fine of as much as $4,300, those flow-rate estimates  derived by a government team and already disputed by BP  will be at the heart of the multi-billion dollar case. The suit singles out BP, which was the primary operator of the well, and its partners in the well. It also names Anadarko Petroleum Co., and the MOEX subsidiary of Mitsui & Co., Triton Asset Leasing, and Transocean, which BP had hired to drill the well. BP's insurer, QBE Underwriting Ltd./Lloyd's, also is named. The suit blames the companies for violating safety procedures and failing to use the best available and safest drilling technology to monitor the well's conditions leading up to the blowout. It is separate from the department's ongoing criminal inquiry, but also is the result of a months-long investigation by the Justice Department.Despite the suit's contention that the failed cement job contributed to the blowout, Halliburton, the company that cemented the well, wasn't named. The Justice Department intends to prove the violations caused or contributed to the oil spill, Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday at a news conference. ""This incident claimed the lives of 11 rig workers and it marked the start of a massive oil spill that would take more than three months to contain,"" he said. ""And it set of a chain reaction of devastating consequences for the people, for the environment, and for the economy of the Gulf Coast, a region still struggling to recover from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.""The Justice Department is asking the court to assess civil penalties under the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the unauthorized discharge of oil into the nation's waters. It's also asking that eight of the defendants  with the exception of BP's insurance company  be declared liable in excess of the $75 million limitation under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 for all removal costs and damages caused by the oil spill. That includes environmental damages. The Clean Water Act allows the government to seek civil fines for every drop of oil spilled into the nation's navigable waters, beginning with $1,100 per barrel spilled. If a judge finds the spill was a result of gross negligence, fines can rise to $4,300 a barrel. Each defendant could face those fines. ""This focus on responsibility comes alongside our response and recovery efforts,"" said EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson. ""As we speak, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force is forming a strategy to help cut through red tape and align the efforts of people working to address the long decline of the Gulf Coast.""BP said in a statement that the civil suit was expected, and that the government's allegations now would have to go to court. The company said it would respond to the government's allegations ""in a timely manner"" and also will continue to cooperate with all government investigations and inquiries.""Alone among the parties, BP has stepped up to pay for the clean-up of the oil, setting aside $20 billion to pay all legitimate claims. We took these steps before any legal determination of responsibility and will continue to fulfill our commitments in the Gulf as the legal process unfolds,"" the BP statement said.John Christiansen, a spokesman for Anadarko, said his company wasn't involved in the operations or decision on the drilling rig.""It is our understanding that under the Oil Pollution Act and the Clean Water Act, all of the relevant parties may be named, even though the ultimate responsibility may rest solely with the operator,"" he said.Anadarko also stands by a statement made in June that blamed the oil spill on BP's ""reckless decisions and actions,"" Christiansen said. He said Anadarko expected BP to pay all legitimate claims.The Justice Department could add additional parties to the suit, Holder said. He also noted that the criminal investigation continues. ""As I've said from the beginning, as our investigations continue, we will not hesitate to take whatever steps are necessary to hold accountable those who are responsible for this spill,"" he said. Environmentalists saw the civil suit as a positive step.""Repairing the damage done to people, wildlife and coastal habitats is a massive undertaking and recovery of Clean Water Act penalties will be a key part of the solution,"" said John Kostyak, the executive director for Wildlife Conservation and Global Warming with the National Wildlife Federation.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/23/5212105/city-manager-seeks-authorization.html,"In a sign that Sacramento's arena effort is gaining urgency, City Manager John Shirey will ask the City Council on Tuesday for the OK to enter into arena financing negotiations with a private investment group as early as Wednesday.Mayor Kevin Johnson's spokesman Ben Sosenko said on Saturday the mayor is confident the private group would have a ""competitive"" bid finalized to buy the Sacramento Kings by the end of the week. That offer would then be submitted to the National Basketball Association, even though arena financing negotiations with the city would have just begun by then.Notably, city officials continue to decline to reveal the names of the group they've been talking with during their effort in recent weeks to keep the team from being sold to a Seattle group.Several people connected to the local effort say the principals are billionaire grocery businessman Ron Burkle of Southern California, who previously made an offer to buy the Kings, and 24 Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov, a Bay Area resident who attempted to buy the Golden State Warriors in 2010.Both Shirey and Johnson have had recent informal talks with the group, and the mayor's representatives said those talks are going well after an initial hiccup two weeks ago when the group asked if the city could provide more than the $255 million the city was prepared to put into an arena project last year.Representatives of Burkle could not be reached for comment Saturday evening. A Mastrov spokesman declined comment.In a last-minute addition Saturday to the council agenda, Shirey expressed a desire to move quickly.""After the council agenda had been posted (Thursday), the mayor's office informed the city manager that discussions with the parties considering an offer to purchase the Sacramento Kings are proceeding well and that the city should be prepared to commence formal negotiations relating to the development of a new downtown entertainment and sports center,"" the city manager's memo stated. ""To provide the City Council and public with as much time as possible  this item has been scheduled for Tuesday.""A staff report with the guiding principles is being prepared  . We apologize that the report will not be available until Monday, but given the circumstances we believe it is best to initiate the public discussion as soon as possible rather than postpone that discussion for another week.""The Maloof family, current majority team owners, recently announced they had signed a tentative deal to sell the team to a Seattle group that includes investor Chris Hansen and Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft.The sale has to be voted on by the NBA board of governors. The vote is expected April 18. Johnson has said he hopes to persuade the league to vote against the Seattle sale. The NBA cannot, however, require the Maloofs to sell to the Burkle and Mastrov group.Assistant City Manager John Dangberg said the council has not been formally told who the investment group is. That group has requested confidentiality for now.Councilman Steve Cohn said he thinks the time is right to begin negotiations, with the city having to have a concrete package in place by April.Cohn said he might ask to restrict the scope of negotiations until the investors' names are officially revealed.Mastrov recently came to Sacramento to meet with a group of potential minority investors in the team, and told them he is very interested in buying the team.Burkle recently flew to New York to meet with NBA Commissioner David Stern, NBA officials said, where he pitched the merits of an arena at Downtown Plaza.Dangberg said Shirey's goal is to bring a preliminary arena financing term sheet to the council for vote sometime before April 18.On Friday, Shirey disclosed that the new investors had asked whether the city would go beyond the $255 million the city had offered in last year's failed arena deal.The city didn't make a counteroffer but instead provided a detailed explanation of the subsidy approved last spring.Shirey said the investors had ""a greater appreciation"" when city officials explained how they came up with that figure.An arena financing package is considered critical to each city's bid for the Kings. Their existing arenas  Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento and Seattle's KeyArena  are considered outdated by NBA standards.It's expected that Sacramento's subsidy, as it was last spring, would come mainly from monetizing thousands of city-owned parking places."\u000a

V"Travis Hatcher embraces the story and memory, but that comes with a warning.""It's hard not to break down  he's that special to me,"" the retired football coach for Ponderosa High School said Friday morning.Hatcher is talking about his greatest overachiever in James Campen, a fixture from the Bruins' heyday in the fall of 1980 and '81 in Shingle Springs. Now the Green Bay Packers offensive-line coach, Campen was 215 pounds of drive-blocking fury as a center. He had a goal of reaching the NFL. If someone scoffed at the suggestion, and plenty did, Campen competed with extra vigor. Campen dominated all comers but attracted no college recruiting interest.""James, his motor really ran fast,"" Hatcher recalled. ""He came to me once after practice, when we lightened up on hitting before the playoffs, and says, 'Coach, are you giving up on us? I want to keep going hard.' He was an all-out guy  high energy, high desire. He had personality, leadership, really smart.""And nothing was going to slow him down. He set a goal to be a player. He was a baby-face kid, and the kid becomes a real man. Talk about a great story.""Campen's first step to fulfilling his dream was taken at Sacramento City College, which in 1982 finished 12-0 and ranked No. 1 in the country with Campen an all-conference center. He landed a scholarship to Tulane, started the 1984 and '85 seasons and received campus honors for bettering his school and community. He went undrafted.Still, Campen never wavered.He camped in the parking lot of the Superdome in New Orleans, like a fan trying to fetch the last ticket to a Rolling Stones concert. He waited for a coach to show up, and then made his plea. Campen had a tryout but was cut. He kept pushing. He played center for the Saints in 1987 and '88, and then signed with Green Bay in 1989 and became fast friends with Brett Favre.A torn hamstring in Week 4 of the 1993 season ended Campen's career.Hatcher brought Campen home to coach Ponderosa's defense, a role he held for four seasons. He was the Bruins' head coach for five years, putting his own money into the weight room, stressing the value of high school athletics and the meaning of rivalries. He expected to be a Ponderosa lifer, insisting the blood he shed was always green  Packers and Bruins. But he couldn't turn down the Packers when they called with an offer.Campen is in his ninth season as a Packers assistant. A photo from Ponderosa's post-9/11 game against Rio Americano is in his office, Campen's hand clasped with Rio coach Mike Smith's during the national anthem. When I visited Campen during the Packers' training camp in 2005, he downplayed his role, just an everyday man. Packers fans, though, belted out his name  ""Hey, Camp! Loved you as a player, man!""""The only other place I'd coach besides here is Ponderosa,"" Campen said then.Campen has been loyal to his mentors. He has flown Hatcher and former Sac City coach Jerry Sullivan to Green Bay for Lambeau Field tours and an inside peek at the storied NFL franchise. Campen's job is to come up with a scheme for his linemen to keep Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers upright and in one piece, including in today's NFC divisional playoff game against the 49ers.Now the emotional part for Hatcher. He recounted a call from Campen on the morning of Super Bowl XLV, following the 2010 season.""He said he was going in for breakfast and said, 'Can you believe this? I'm having breakfast before the Super Bowl,' "" Hatcher said.""This is beyond a dream. He said, 'Coach, you're going to love this. I got them to put in a Ponderosa play. You'll know it when you see it.' Then he said  'I thought you'd love that. I just want you to know that if it wasn't for you and the staff and Ponderosa, I wouldn't be here.'""Gets me every time. James  he left his mark."""\u000a

V"A move by a local tribe to quietly buy a controlling interest in more than 250 acres of land approved for development within Auburn's city limits has sparked concern among some in town, including the mayor.The fear is the United Auburn Indian Community, which owns Thunder Valley Casino in Lincoln, will abandon the approved development plan to instead build substandard housing or  worse, in the view of some  another casino.The tribe's ownership first came to light through an anonymous email sent to city officials and to property owners who have agreed to sell their land in the development.""It's gotten people all worried,"" said Will Wong, city development director. ""They jumped to Indian tribe, Indian casino.""Mayor Kevin Hanley said he would have liked to have been told about the purchase earlier and now just wants some clarity. ""We don't normally care who the owner is,"" he said. ""But a federally recognized Indian tribe is a little different.""The city has no means to compel a development corporation to disclose its investors. Hanley said last week that tribal leaders have yet to sit down with him or the city manager. The first phase of the long, contentious Baltimore Ravine development could yield 270 housing units on the 277-acre property in the southwest area of the city. Developer Stephen Des Jardins has long been the face of the development. But in 2008 the tribe was approached about getting involved and eventually took a controlling interest in Baltimore Ravine LLC, said Doug Elmets, a spokesman for the tribe. Des Jardins remained as the project lead, with the tribe quietly in the background. Elmets said the tribe was excited to invest in land so close to its ancestral homeland and called suggestions that it would build anything less than first class ""mean-spirited."" He said the tribe took a controlling interest in the property before the city approved the development plan in 2011 and is still committed to it. ""The tribe has absolutely no intention of having the land taken into trust by the federal government,"" Elmets said.The process by which land becomes sovereign Indian territory with fewer land-use constraints is complicated and public, and could take anywhere from two to seven years, said Carmen Facio, realty officer for the Sacramento office of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.""There are all kinds of things they would have to do,"" Facio said. Building a casino on that land is another complicated process that would require state approval. Elmets scoffed at the idea the tribe would compete with its own successful casino.He said there is little difference between this investment and other land developments, including the tribe's ownership of the Whitney Oaks golf course.Hanley said he would like to see Auburn's ""good neighbor"" relationship with the tribe continue. ""Just because the tribe has taken ownership doesn't mean they can do what they want tomorrow,"" Hanley acknowledged.Wong seemed less concerned. ""As far as we're concerned the development is moving forward,"" he said."\u000a

More than 550 runners participated in the 5K and accompanying 1 mile race. Many were running or walking the course because their lives have been touched by the disease  which is expected to kill more than 51,000 peole in the United States in 2012.Colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men and women combined in the United States.The 5K race was won by Jackson Burke with a time of 17:42. But speed was not the main focus on Saturday. The race was a clarion call for people to take the disease and preventive steps seriously, and a time to remember those who succumbed to the disease.""I'm running this race because I have friends and loved ones who have had colon cancer, or are fighting colon cancer at this point,"" said Debbie Chabra of Roseville. Chabra ran with a team. As a nurse who works in the surgical unit at Kaiser Permanente in Roseville, she sees how prevalent the disease is and what it can do to the human body.""This race brings about awareness and compassion and helps people know more about it  because you have to be a fighter and you have to be aggressive,"" she said.People with a parent, sibling or child who has colon cancer are at two to three times the risk of developing the cancer as those without a family history.One of those running the race Saturday was Debbie Whiteley. ""My grandfather's sister was too embarrassed to go to the doctor, and that's why she passed away from it,"" she said. ""My grandfather did go and he survived, so I think it's real important to get the word out."" The race owes its origin to Fran Watson, who was told in February 2006 that she had stage III colon cancer. She was 27 at the time. Her 41-year-old sister got the same diagnosis a scant two months later.In 2008, a year after chemotherapy and removal of 18 inches of her colon, Watson was working for the CCA and getting the first Undy 500 race, in Philadelphia, Pa., off the ground. More than 500 people showed up, and the event raised more than $115,000.""Last year the organization raised over $1 million,"" said Daniella Pea, national operations manager with Undy 5000 and the CCA. A portion of the money it brings in stays in the host community to make available free screenings for those who are underinsured or do not have health insurance. ""We like to put our money where our mouth is,"" said Pea. In Sacramento, proceeds will be given to the California Colorectal Coalition.""Colon cancer is an issue that a lot of people do not talk about on a normal basis,"" said Pea. ""They don't realize how common the disease is and how preventable. Our research shows that only about 60 percent of people get screened who meet the qualification for a screening,"" she said."\u000a

Between now and Thanksgiving, we'll bring you stories of local folks who benefited from Food Bank & Family Services programs. Each year, the Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services' clothing program hands out shoes, jackets and other clothing to needy families. When second-grader Collette Madden learned that some teenagers, and even children her age, don't have shoes, she co- ordinated a shoe drive at her school and was able to donate more than 400 pairs of shoes to the food bank, which counts on donations and volunteer efforts such as those from Collette to help folks in need. ""People should know it's really hard to be homeless,"" Collette said.THANKSGIVING DAY RUN TO FEED THE HUNGRYStart time: 10K  8:30 a.m.; timed 5K  9 a.m.; untimed 5K and walkers  immediately after the 5K runWhere: J Street entrance to California State University, SacramentoHow far: 5K (3.1 mile) run/walk and 10K (6.2 mile) runExpected number of participants: 25,000-28,000Register: Go to www.runtofeedthehungry.com until 11:59 p.m. Nov. 20 or register in person at the REI at 1790 Expo Parkway, Sacramento, Nov. 17-21.

V"President Barack Obama's insistence that marginal tax rates rise for families making more than $250,000 has convinced millions of affluent Americans that they are likely to be writing larger checks to the government next year. But many of those families have no reason to fret. A close look at the president's plan shows that a large majority of families making up to $300,000  as well as hundreds of thousands of families with even larger incomes  would not pay taxes at a higher marginal rate. Because the complexity of the tax code makes it difficult to draw clean lines, they are the beneficiaries of choices the administration has made to ensure that families earning less than $250,000 do not pay higher rates. Some of those affluent households still would pay higher taxes next year under other parts of the president's tax plan and increases imposed by the Affordable Care Act, but not under the centerpiece, the part most frequently promoted by the president and most bitterly opposed by congressional Republicans. John Boudreau, the president of a Connecticut construction firm who expects to make about $300,000 this year, said that was a welcome surprise. He voted for Obama and said he was ready to pay taxes at a higher rate. But he'd rather not. ""I'm willing to, but if it works that I'm not, so be it,"" he said. ""I will not be a person that's going to stick an extra check in my tax bill as my donation to my country.""Unless the White House and Congress are able to reach an agreement, federal taxes are scheduled to rise sharply next year for a large majority of Americans. Tax cuts first passed in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush are scheduled to expire. So are cuts passed during Obama's first term. The president's plan would prevent most of the scheduled increase for those below an income threshold Obama generally describes as $250,000. The Senate has passed similar legislation. But Democrats remain at loggerheads with House Republicans, who want to prevent scheduled increases for the most affluent households, too. And the parties disagree about how to prune federal spending. The number that now divides the parties was introduced by Obama in 2007, in the early days of the presidential campaign, when he promised to extend the Bush tax cuts for families that made less than that amount. ""I can make a firm pledge,"" Obama said in September 2008. ""Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.""When policymakers talk about income, however, they don't mean the amount of money a family earns; they mean the portion subject to taxes. The government does not tax contributions to retirement plans, interest payments on mortgages or charitable donations, among other things. As a result, two families with the same incomes will most likely have different taxable incomes. To guarantee that tax rates do not increase for any family making less than $250,000, the Obama administration proposed in 2009 to raise marginal rates on taxable income above roughly $230,000  because the minimum amount of income a family is entitled to shelter from taxation is roughly $20,000. But the average amount families in that income range are entitled to shelter from taxation is much larger, closer to $60,000. In other words, families with taxable income of $230,000 on average earned about $290,000 in 2009. ""They wanted to be able to say that 'Absolutely nobody making less than $250,000 could possibly pay higher taxes under our plan,' "" said Bob McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal advocacy group. ""So they had to assume the most ridiculous assumptions, that even if you're a childless couple with no itemized deductions making $250,001, your taxes still won't go up. They figured that if this couple existed and their taxes went up, somebody would find them and jump on 'em.""Furthermore, to remain consistent with the president's original promise, the administration has adjusted the original numbers for inflation. When Obama says $250,000, the White House says he means ""in 2009 dollars."" It is now proposing to raise marginal rates on families with taxable incomes above $246,000  meaning, on average, families earning more than about $305,000. While the president has said that he wants to raise tax rates for the top 2 percent, only about 1 percent of taxpayers will face higher marginal rates, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a respected research group. The restoration of the other provisions temporarily suspended by the Bush tax cuts, including limits on deductions and higher taxes on investment income, would raise taxes for only about 32 percent of families with income between $250,000 and $300,000, according to an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice. About 77 percent of families with income between $300,000 and $350,000 would face an increase."\u000a

V"Things weren't clicking for the Golden Sierra High School football team during nonleague play.The Grizzlies started 1-3, albeit against bigger schools.""But we knew we weren't playing like we should,"" said second-year coach John Hilton. ""Part of it was that we hadn't come together as a group.""That might seem strange for a team with only 21 players at one of the smallest public schools in the Sac-Joaquin Section with 563 students.But the Garden Valley school draws from far-flung foothill communities across the Georgetown Divide in El Dorado County, and most of the players were in their first foray on the varsity.So Hilton, who teaches and coaches baseball at Placer High School, decided to try something different, especially with a bye week before the start of Sierra Delta League play.""We needed a new way of thinking,"" Hilton said.Hilton began matching seniors with juniors for getting-to-know-you daily lunch sessions. He'd stop practices, call up a couple of players front and center and ask others to talk about them.""We started to see enthusiasm,"" Hilton said. ""Before, someone would score a touchdown, and no one really got excited. Now we had 21 kids coming together. That little wall of uncertainty dropped.""Golden Sierra has since won four games, all in league, including beating two-time defending league champion Bradshaw Christian 28-14 and two-time Sac-Joaquin Section Division V runner-up Highlands 16-14.Entering tonight's league game against Encina (4-4, 1-3) at El Camino High School, Hilton says the Grizzlies (5-3, 4-0) could become the first football team in the school's 33-year history to go undefeated in league play.They're doing it with nine two-way players and no college prospects.""These kids are pretty gutsy,"" said Hilton, who coaches one of the nation's top football recruits, defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes, in baseball at Placer.Quarterback-safety Bryson Campbell, running back-linebacker Adam Sewell and linemen Kyle Moe and Ryan Echeveria provide the senior leadership.Wide receiver-defensive back Cameron Stephens, wide receiver-linebacker Brian Cann and Daniel Lesher are among the junior leaders.Lesher played quarterback on the junior varsity last year but became the varsity's starting fullback and linebacker when senior Thai Cotton suffered season-ending injuries in an auto accident just before the start of fall practice.""Everyone contributes on this team,"" Hilton said. ""All our players know how to play multiple positions.""Hilton deserve kudos for extra duties, too.After teaching at Placer, he drives the windy roads to Garden Valley in the afternoons for football practice, then takes the arduous 50-minute drive home to Lincoln at night.""The hike in gas prices has been the hardest part,"" Hilton said. ""It's tough on Friday nights, especially the road games. We don't get back to school until 12:30 or 1 a.m."" But the drive home these last four weeks has been very nice."""\u000a

V"As debuts go, this qualifies as a rousing start to a career of sudden promise.Folsom High School quarterback Jake Browning produced a varsity introduction worthy of national recognition.Days after winning the starting job following a spirited summer competition with senior Taylor Miller-Wing, Browning unleashed a national-record tying 10 touchdown passes  five to receiver Phillip Carter  in No. 10 Folsom's stunning 68-28 win over No. 20 Woodcreek on Friday night.Stunning as in how effortlessly the 6-foot-2 sophomore picked up the spread offense scheme that relies heavily on decision-making and accuracy.And stunning in how he stepped in for graduated Bee Offensive Player of the Year Tanner Trosin, who shattered state single-season yardage marks and is now at Cal Poly.All Trosin did was replace MaxPreps and Bee Player of the Year quarterback Dano Graves, who set a state mark with 82 total touchdowns in 2010 and is now at the Air Force Academy.So here's the new guy Browning setting the bar even higher?He had a Madden 12 sort of night in Roseville, completing 34 of 51 passes with one interception for 689 yards, second most in national prep history behind David Koral's 764 for Pacific Palisades in Southern California in 1999.Browning's 10 touchdown passes are tied with six others nationally and obliterated the regional record of eight Kevin Tinney of Kennedy threw against Cordova in a 1987 Metro League game.Browning was not sacked, thanks to quick feet and his line of Josh Wormley, Reed Garmsen, Dalton Bledsoe, Mike D'Ottavio and Cody Creason.""Incredible game,"" Folsom co-coach Kris Richardson said, heaping praise on co-coach Troy Taylor, who has mentored Browning. ""We knew we had something special in Jake. He can really sling it. He knows the offense inside and out. It's exciting to think how good this kid can be.""Offered a humble Browning, ""I was just trying to make plays.""As Browning was taking apart Woodcreek, news quickly circulated that Miller-Wing had elected to turn in his gear late this week. Richardson was in too high spirits to talk about that downer. The coach said he planned to use both quarterbacks in games this season. Richardson also defended any notion that the Bulldogs ran up the score, explaining his spread team rarely runs the ball or punts and that a lot of passes are short bubble screens.Carter had 10 catches for 317 yards, running under perfect strikes early and taking screen plays in for scores later.""Our run game is our quick-pass game, and it's no different than a power-I team running all over someone,"" Richardson said. ""What are we supposed to do? Run out of bounds? We don't run up the score. (Woodcreek) blitzed seven all night. That's the risk-reward when you blitz the house  guys are open.""Folsom's Lucas Owan had 14 catches for 236 yards and Troy Knox eight for 102 yards. Each had two touchdown catches.Stephen Nogosek passed for 227 yards and four touchdowns in the first half for Woodcreek, which was shut out 27-0 in the second halfTerrific Terrell  He didn't shatter records, but Deaundre Terrell sparkled in his varsity debut for No. 6 Pleasant Grove.

V"IRVINE  There weren't even enough seats for them.At the CIF State Volleyball Championships, only 16 chairs were set up on each team's sideline, nowhere near sufficient for St. Francis High School's 19 Troubadours.Not that they were necessary. Only the edges of the seats were filled at any one time, and they were empty when a player on the court made a big play.The big plays were few and far between, however, as St. Francis lost to Marymount of Los Angeles 3-1 (25-11, 25-17, 23-25, 25-20) Saturday in the Division I title match at Concordia University.""People said I was crazy keeping so many players,"" Wright said of her decision to field such a large roster. ""There were that many girls worthy of being St. Francis varsity volleyball players.  I wanted them all to experience this season.""With how this all has unfolded, there aren't too many skeptical of that plan now. The Troubadours (38-3), routinely among the NorCal elite, had their finest season in recent memory They won their 12th Sac-Joaquin Section title, earning the top seed in the CIF NorCal playoffs and making their second appearance in the state title match. The only two teams to defeat St. Francis this year were Marymount and Archbishop Mitty of San Jose, which captured its ninth state championship 30 minutes before the Troubadours took the floor.Marymount (37-5), making its eighth state championship match appearance, entered the match admittedly still smarting from a five-set defeat to Palo Alto in a thriller in last year's D-I title match.The Sailors got out to a 7-1 lead behind outside hitter Kathleen Harris and middle blocker Kaitlyn Edwards, who combined for 10 kills in the set. By the time St. Francis scored a point not given to them by a Sailors error, it was already in a 16-6 hole.The second set was more even as St. Francis hung with Marymount before an 8-3 run from the Sailors put it out of reach. Troubadours outside hitter Gaby Palmeri had four of her team-high 13 kills in the frame as St. Francis began to close up its block and step in front of more Marymount spikes.""That frustrated us,"" Marymount senior middle blocker Ashlie Williams said.""We're not used to teams figuring us out that early.""The Troubadours earned their first lead in the third set, getting out to a 2-0 lead with Loni Kreun at the service line.St. Francis gained separation late in the set, going up 20-15 on the strength of some punishing Courtney Robledo attacks from the outside. After the Sailors battled back behind senior outside hitter Courtney Jasuta, who at one point scored four straight Sailor points, Troubadours senior middle Alison Child put the set away with a solo stuff block of Jasuta.A Jasuta attack error tied the fourth set 20-20, giving St. Francis its final chance to force a fifth set. But when Marymount's Harris scored on a sharp cut from the outside, it ignited a 5-0 run that gave Marymount its seventh state championship.Palmeri paced St. Francis with 13 kills while St. Francis senior setter Ali Koumelis added 29 assists and 11 digs.""We all knew we could (win),"" Koumelis said. ""It took every one of us to get to this point. If we were missing one player, we couldn't have done it."""\u000a

V"Eliu Gonzalez, a South Florida fisherman who worked the waters off Miami-Dade and Monroe counties for more than a decade, lived hundreds of miles from the Deepwater Horizon rig when it exploded in April 2010.But that didnt stop Gonzalez from logging onto the British Petroleums Gulf Coast claim center website five months later, stating that that the massive oil spill cost him more than $110,000 in lost income.Gonzalez is no longer on the open seas, but rather behind bars. Federal prosecutors have charged him with attempting to defraud the Horizon Oil Spill Trust, which was established to reimburse those impacted by the catastrophe.Gonzalez, formerly of Florida City and held without bond as a flight risk, is the first to face prosecution in the Southern District of Florida on Deepwater-related fraud charges. His three-page indictment, unsealed Tuesday, did not make clear what exactly he feloniously told Gulf Coast Claims Facility  responsible for administering, mediating, and settling certain Deepwater-related grievances. It merely stated that Gonzalez, 36, knew that his claim of losing $110,616 in income was bogus.Dishonest individuals who seek illicit gains through false damage claims wind up further burdening the victims who really need compensation, said acting FBI Special Agent in Charge Dena E. Choucair. The FBI will continue to work with our partners to root out the perpetrators of these crimes and bring them to justice.Gonzalezs court and state paper trail indicates he was an active fisherman with a long list of marine-related run-ins with the law, both in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties.In 1997, he received six months probation  which he later violated  after pleading no-contest to spearfishing at John Pennekamp State Park, a restricted area. He later was fined for the possession of undersized lobster and dolphin fish in Miami-Dade. He has paid out more than $1,000 in fishing-related fines since 1999.To read the complete article, visit www.miamiherald.com."\u000a

V"Chelsea kicked off its Europa League campaign in positive fashion, stealing a vital 1-0 win over Sparta Prague at the Generali Arena on Thursday.The Blues, who won the Champions League last season, were relegated to the Europa League by finishing third in Group E of this season's competition, slipping behind Juventus and Shakhtar Donetsk.They made sure to get off on the right foot in the two-legged affair as Oscar's 82nd-minute strike put Chelsea in pole position heading into the return match.Sparta Prague made the brighter start of the two sides by getting into great scoring positions throughout the opening period, but the home side failed to find a goal for its efforts.The Czech Republic club was left to rue those misses as Chelsea took control of the match with just eight minutes to go.Oscar entered the match in the 81st minute and made an immediate impact, working a nice one-two with Eden Hazard before skipping past a defender and sliding a near-post shot past Tomas Vaclik in the Sparta Prague net.It proved to be all Rafa Benitez's men would need as they take their one-goal lead back to Stamford Bridge for the second leg on February 21.Fellow English club Liverpool was not quite as fortunate in its first match of the Europa League knockout round.The Reds held their ground until the second half when Zenit St. Petersburg bagged two goals in the span of three minutes en route to a 2-0 victory at the Petrovsky Stadium on Thursday. Hulk opened the scoring in the 69th minute with a rocket from distance that made its way into the upper corner, and Sergey Semak made it two for the Russian club when he fired home a missed clearance from Martin Skrtel.Europa League action at White Hart Lane saw three wonder-strikes as Tottenham claimed a 2-1 win over Lyon.Gareth Bale opened the scoring with a fantastic free kick just before halftime but was canceled out by Samuel Umtiti's sensational first-time volley placed perfectly in the upper corner in the 55th minute. It remained even until the third minute of stoppage time when Bale rocketed another free kick into the back of the net to continue his sublime run of form.Napoli came into the round as one of the favorites to claim the Europa League crown, but its chances of advancing took a major hit on Thursday as the Italian side was left stunned in a 3-0 loss to Viktoria Plzen at the Stadio San Paolo. Vladimir Darida, Frantisek Rajtoral and Stanislav Tecl scored for the Czech club, sending them home to the Struncovy Sady for the second leg with three away goals that will make it tough for Walter Mazzarri's men to get through.Atletico Madrid also endured a tough first leg as it fell at the Vicente Calderon in a 2-0 loss to Rubin Kazan. The Europa League holders dug themselves a major hole for the return match as Rubin Kazan gained a massive advantage behind goals from Gokdeniz Karadeniz and Pablo Orbaiz.Also on Thursday, Anzhi claimed a 3-1 home win over Hannover, Ajax topped Steaua Bucurest 2-0 at the Amsterdam Arena, Benfica stole a 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen at the BayArena, Levante cruised to a 3-0 defeat of Greek side Olympiakos, Bordeaux managed a 1-1 draw at Dynamo Kyiv, Fenerbahce was held to a 0-0 draw by BATE Borisov, Borussia Monchengladbach and Lazio finished level in a 3-3 thriller at Borussia Park, Basel claimed a 2-0 win over Dnipro, Rodrigo Palacio bagged a brace in Inter Milan's 2-0 defeat of CFR Cluj, Glynor Plet grabbed a late equalizer in Genk's 1-1 draw at Stuttgart, and Newcastle was held to a 0-0 home draw by Metalist Kharkiv."\u000a

V"The first coach to call Deonard Wilson when he landed the Grant High School boys basketball coaching job three years ago was his old buddy Derek Swafford.They continue to call each other weekly, sharing stories of player achievement and team goals. Swafford, the veteran Sacramento High coach, initially told Wilson it would take three years of tireless work to build a program and reach the NBA building not far from Del Paso Heights that now goes by Sleep Train Arena.But the master plan for Swafford didn't call for a Grant stunner at his expense.Wednesday night, Swafford and Wilson embraced before and after a Sac-Joaquin Section Division II semifinal pitting programs that have played the sport since the 1930s. The upstart, fourth-seeded Pacers downed the top-seeded Dragons 72-69 in a thriller that included a frenetic pace  down to the dueling drumlines that thundered in the arena  and cool late foul shooting to ice it.De'Sean Parsons, Grant's superb 6-foot-7 senior guard, had 26 points and took over down the stretch as he has so many times in this bounce-back Pacers season. His steal, dunk and free throw gave Grant a 66-62 lead with 1:23 to go. He made another steal and passed to Donovan Brown for a layup and a 68-62 lead with 1:08 left, and the upset was at hand.Afterward, Grant principal Craig Murray led a charge of high-fives and hugs for scores of fans and students who have embraced the gritty, active Pacers. In the back tunnel, Wilson leaned against the wall, exhaled and composed himself.""I'm so proud for this great school, our kids, the community, and I'm the happiest guy in the building,"" said Wilson, embracing 12-year-old son Jevon.The Pacers (23-7) are now feeling a bit more greedy. Next is third-seeded and defending champion Antelope on Saturday at Sleep Train. Grant won its first section title in 1977 and its last in 1999.""It's one thing to get here,"" Parsons said, ""but now we want to win it.""Pacers baseball star Brandon Nunn had 12 points and Brown 10. Joseph Barnes had 23 points, and James Hadnot scored 20 to lead Sacramento (23-7). The Dragons came in with five D-III titles in seven title-game appearances since 2005, and they still advance to the NorCal playoffs, as do all section semifinalists.""My hat's off to Grant,"" Swafford said. ""They haven't been here in a long, long time. I know what that feels like. I am really proud of Deonard and happy for him and his kids.""Antelope 55, Rocklin 47  Isaiah Ellis led four Titans in double figures with 14 points to go with 10 rebounds, and he keyed a late surge that held off the upset-minded, seventh-seeded Thunder, which cut it to six early in the fourth on a three-pointer by Hayden Cook (17 points).Gabe Bealer, Ellis' bruise brother partner inside, had 13 points, Tyler Winston scored 11 and Rashard Thornhill 10 for Antelope (24-6). The fifth Titans starter, Isiah Quintero, had four points, four rebounds, four blocked shots and four hard fouls. Rocklin (20-10) went from a four-win campaign last season to a NorCal team this season under first-year coach Casey Cutts.  Division I semifinalsSheldon 86, Bethel 72  The top-seeded Huskies were for the most part flawless in offensive execution in taking leads of 11-0 and 17-2 before the Jaguars cut it to eight with two NBA-range three-pointers with 6:25 to go. Sheldon (24-5) responded with a 14-0 run and now targets a large-school section-record four-peat championship.Fresh off a triple double against Kennedy, Huskies floor leader D'Erryl Williams scored 25 points on 12-of-13 shooting and had six assists and seven rebounds. Darin Johnson scored 22 on 9-of-13 shooting with five assists in front of his future coach at Washington, Lorenzo Romar.Antonio Lewis had 15 points and Ryan Manning 14 for the Huskies, who made 37 of 59 shots (63 percent) and had 24 assists. Sheldon has had at least 20 assists in three straight playoff games."\u000a

V"Hank Humphers didn't need a refresher course on the meaning of this one.He's lived it, having grown up on the sideline of Nevada Union High School football games, mirroring the delight or anxiety of his father and NU coach Dave Humphers, depending on results against Grant.On Friday, young Humphers experienced his first Nevada Union-Grant game as a player, and he and fellow senior linebacker ace Tanner Vallejo were paramount in keying a defense that belted the No. 3 Pacers in Del Paso Heights in a renewal of a rivalry that ended much the way it left off.The second-ranked Miners of Grass Valley rolled 37-7 behind four touchdown passes by Kyle Cota and a rousing defensive effort against a program more accustomed to issuing the statement moments.The last time the storied programs faced off was in the playoffs in 2005, a 30-0 Miners rout. Though this was the first time the contest wasn't part of the Capital Athletic or Metro League schedule, anyone involved would have to be in a deep fog not to comprehend its significance.The teams pushed each other to excel in the 1990s and 2000s in the most spirited rivalry in the Sac-Joaquin Section. The schools have combined to win 10 section football titles since 1992.Coach Humphers leads Grant boss Mike Alberghini 10-8-1 in head-to-head meetings since they became head coaches in 1991. All-time, NU inched ahead 16-15-1.""I know this game is big, always has been, and we talked about it this week,"" said Hank Humphers, who rushed for 47 yards and recovered one of five Grant turnovers.Cota, a senior, passed for 177 yards on eight completions, and a host of NU runners combined for 165 yards behind an offensive line anchored by guard Forrest Good. The line battered a Pacers defense that was a step slow and thinned without standout linebackers Tui Lopa, Moses Moala and Jonah Toma, all out with injuries.Grant at full strength might not have solved Cota and the crafty wing-T with its myriad fakes and deception. Cota hit Ian Davis for touchdown strikes of 59 and eight yards and Austin Marks from 10 yards out for a 20-0 halftime lead. Cota hit Humphers for a 38-yard touchdown for a 27-0 lead as the Miners looked like a poised, experienced championship outfit.Both coaches said the rivalry will continue next season, including the return of a pregame luncheon with team captains to foster sportsmanship. The lunch didn't happen this week. The teams were a bit chippy Friday, pointing, gesturing, gyrating, though at the end, there was plenty of admiration. Grant players to a man accepted that they were throttled by the better team.Alberghini cracked before the game that his wife may need to fit him with a pacemaker as, in his advanced age, it may take him longer to recover from stinging losses. The teams could face off in the Division I playoffs.Grant's Marquise Carter-Petit rushed for 136 yards and had a dazzling 95-yard kickoff return negated by a penalty. Trayvon Henderson had 96 receiving yards from Isaiah Rios, who vowed a better showing next week after fumbling three times."\u000a

V"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Congressman Doc Hastings in a letter to the White House accused a Department of the Interior official of mismanagement and called for President Obama to nominate a replacement.The letter, sent last week, said the department's Deputy Inspector General Mary Kendall, who has in effect served as acting inspector general for four years, has failed to act as an independent watchdog and instead has accommodated the desires of department officials and the Obama administration while seeking permanent appointment to the job.""Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, an Inspector General is expected to be a politically independent watchdog responsible for identifying fraud, waste and abuse, and to report management problems to the Department head and Congress so that they may ensure such problems are appropriately addressed,"" Hastings, a Pasco Republican, said in the letter. ""Regrettably, Ms. Kendall has not appropriately upheld this standard and it is not appropriate for her to remain in charge of the (Inspector General's) office any longer.""Hastings is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which has overseen the office run by Kendall for about two years. Along with the letter, committee staff released a 72-page report detailing instances they say show Kendall's mismanagement.A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General did not return a voice mail left by the Herald on Friday.The report, titled Holding Interior Watchdog Accountable, claims that Kendall and her chief of staff Stephen Hardgrove did not fully investigate allegations of misconduct by the Obama administration and instead handled complaints informally without public reports or informing Congress.Examples included allegations that:-- Hardgrove decided not to pursue a whistleblower complaint by a Bureau of Reclamation scientist who said he was wrongfully terminated for questioning the scientific integrity of the Interior Department's decision to remove Klamath River dams;-- No ethics review or evaluation was performed of a romantic relationship between a department official and a renewable energy lobbyist while the official worked on renewable energy issues for the department;-- No public report was made on allegations that the former director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement may have interfered in an investigation of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico for political purposes;-- Kendall allowed political appointees in the department to offer extensive edits, reviews and comments on a draft study on the department's renewable energy program, and that Kendall softened critical findings in the report causing disagreement among her staff;-- Kendall inadequately documented the management of investigations.This isn't the first time Hastings and Kendall have butted heads. New Orleans newspaper The Times-Picayune reported May 10, 2012, that Hastings questioned the independence of Kendall's investigation into allegations the Obama administration intentionally edited a report on a deep-water drilling moratorium to include endorsement by experts when the experts hadn't been consulted.Hastings has been an advocate of drilling for oil offshore and on public lands, and a vocal opponent of breaching Northwest hydroelectric dams."\u000a

V"There's something undeniably watchable and winning about ""Memphis,"" the eager-to-please musical now at the Community Center Theater. It's not the slick, superficial story of music and race in 1950s Memphis being told, but the lively and heartfelt performances that pop the production out of its synthesized schematics. Bryan Fenkart as Huey, a goofy white DJ who has discovered rhythm and blues, and Felicia Boswell as Felicia, a young African American star yearning to shine, are impossible to dislike. Individually they light up the stage and, though their central romance doesn't particularly catch fire, the pair do what they can with what they've got.The story of ""Memphis"" centers on Huey and his love of African American music (""The Music of My Soul""). When he happens on an R juke joint with a gorgeous singer leading the band, he couldn't care less that he's the only white person in the club. Throughout the show, in fact, Huey is very much of the ""Why can't we all just get along?"" sensibility. Well the reason is they're in the South in the early '50s, and there are laws (and folks on both sides with strong feelings) against those sort of things. Huey's a romantic in more ways than one.Boswell's Felicia has a more pragmatic view of things, but then she has to because she's black (""Colored Woman""). Still, as Huey creates a sensation around himself as white DJ spinning black music, he tries to bring Felicia along with him. The ideas of racial separation and inequality are very much in the forefront of ""Memphis,"" and they're dealt with directly if not with subtlety. The ideas are also dispatched pretty quickly so the next high-energy good-time superficially blues-ish or gospel-ish song and dance number can smooth the way. Sergio Trujillo choreographed the production, and the athletic ensemble happily charges into his dances. Christopher Ashley efficiently directs the show, which races through several years of the characters' lives after a careful setup.There are strong supporting performances from Horace V. Rogers as Felicia's brother Delray, Rhett George as the philosophical Gator, and Will Mann as the secretly gifted Bobby. Julie Johnson as Huey's mother brings down the house with her own gospel conversion.David Bryan (a founding member and keyboardist of Bon Jovi) wrote the music and joined Joe DiPietro for the lyrics. The book by DiPietro won the 2010 Tony Award as did the entire production for best musical, Bryan's score, and the orchestrations by Bryan and Daryl Waters.The musical seems at times like a pastiche of ""Hairspray"" (the redemptive power of interracial dancing) and ""Dreamgirls"" (black women entertainers succeed when they channel their inner Diana Ross) but it entertains thoroughly all the way into its final bows.Memphis   What: Broadway Sacramento presents the national touring production of the Tony-winning musical about the problems of race and the birth of rock 'n' roll in 1950s Memphis.When: 8 p.m. today through Saturday; 2 p.m. today, Saturday and SundayWhere: Community Center Theater, 1301 L St., SacramentoTickets: $19-$73Information: (916) 557-1999 or www.calmt.comTime: 2 hours and 30 minutes including one intermission."\u000a

V"Opinion>Nicholas D. Kristof",http://www.sacbee.com/2012/04/06/4394737/handicapping-the-veep-stakes-for.html,"Let's hope you're not reading this column while munching on a chicken sandwich. That's because my topic today is a pair of new scientific studies suggesting that poultry on factory farms are routinely fed caffeine, active ingredients of Tylenol and Benadryl, banned antibiotics and even arsenic. ""We were kind of floored,"" said Keeve E. Nachman, a co-author of both studies and a scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Center for a Livable Future.""It's unbelievable what we found."" He said that the researchers had intended to test only for antibiotics. But assays for other chemicals and pharmaceuticals didn't cost extra, so researchers asked for those results as well. ""We haven't found anything that is an immediate health concern,"" Nachman added. ""But it makes me question how comfortable we are feeding a number of these things to animals that we're eating. It bewilders me."" Likewise, I grew up on a farm and thought I knew what to expect in my food. But Benadryl? Arsenic? These studies don't mean that you should dump the contents of your refrigerator, but they do raise serious questions about the food we eat and how we should shop. It turns out that arsenic has routinely been fed to poultry (and sometimes hogs) because it reduces infections and makes flesh an appetizing shade of pink. There's no evidence that such low levels of arsenic harm either chickens or the people eating them, but still.  Big Ag doesn't advertise the chemicals it stuffs into animals, so the scientists conducting these studies figured out a clever way to detect them. Bird feathers, like human fingernails, accumulate chemicals and drugs that an animal is exposed to. So scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Arizona State University examined feather meal  a poultry byproduct made of feathers. One study, just published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, Environmental Science & Technology, found that feather meal routinely contained a banned class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. These antibiotics (such as Cipro), are illegal in poultry production because they can breed antibiotic- resistant ""superbugs"" that harm humans. Already, antibiotic-resistant infections kill more Americans annually than AIDS, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The same study also found that one-third of feather-meal samples contained an antihistamine that is the active ingredient of Benadryl. The great majority of feather meal contained acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. And feather-meal samples from China contained an antidepressant that is the active ingredient in Prozac. Poultry-growing literature has recommended Benadryl to reduce anxiety among chickens, apparently because stressed chickens have tougher meat and grow more slowly. Tylenol and Prozac presumably serve the same purpose. Researchers found that most feather-meal samples contained caffeine. It turns out that chickens are sometimes fed coffee pulp and green tea powder to keep them awake so that they can spend more time eating. (Is that why they need the Benadryl, to calm them down?)The other peer-reviewed study, reported in a journal called Science of the Total Environment, found arsenic in every sample of feather meal tested. Almost 9 in 10 broiler chickens in the United States had been fed arsenic, according to a 2011 industry estimate. These findings will surprise some poultry farmers because even they often don't know what chemicals they feed their birds. Huge food companies require farmers to use a proprietary food mix, and the farmer typically doesn't know exactly what is in it. I asked the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association for comment, but it said that it had not seen the studies and had nothing more to say. What does all this mean for consumers? The study looked only at feathers, not meat, so we don't know exactly what chemicals reach the plate, or at what levels. The uncertainties are enormous, but I asked Nachman about the food he buys for his own family. ""I've been studying food-animal production for some time, and the more I study, the more I'm drawn to organic,"" he said. ""We buy organic."" I'm the same. I used to be skeptical of organic, but the more reporting I do on our food supply, the more I want my own family eating organic  just to be safe. To me, this underscores the pitfalls of industrial farming. When I was growing up on our hopelessly inefficient family farm, we didn't routinely drug animals. If our chickens grew anxious, the reason was perhaps a fox  and we never tried to resolve the problem with Benadryl. My take is that the business model of industrial agriculture has some stunning accomplishments, such as producing cheap food that saves us money at the grocery store. But we all may pay more in medical costs because of antibiotic-resistant infections. Frankly, after reading these studies, I'm so depressed about what has happened to farming that I wonder: Could a Prozac-laced chicken nugget help?"\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/27/5223379/back-from-middle-east-sen-marco.html,"Sen. Marco Rubio, back from a Middle East trip, said Wednesday that the United States should start supplying ammunition to moderate Syrian opposition groups in order to protect U.S. interests by countering the rise of radical groups.Rubio met with top Israeli and Jordanian leaders, along with a former Syrian prime minister , last week during a three-day visit. He spoke about the trip at a prominent Washington think tank as he shored up his foreign policy portfolio for a possible 2016 presidential run. On Iran, Rubio, R-Fla., said U.S. sanctions are damaging the Iranian economy, but he predicted they wont stop Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior leaders in Tel Aviv, Rubio stopped short, however, of supporting a military strike by the United States or Israel to take out Irans nascent nuclear facilities.I agree with their concerns that Iran is moving toward development and deployment of nuclear weapons, and that it is using the (current) negotiations as a ploy, Rubio said in a luncheon talk at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.Rubio said the threat of Iran developing nuclear weapons and the Syrian war are more urgent matters for the security of both Israel and the United States, putting Palestinian peace initiatives on the back burner.Despite having voted Tuesday against confirming former Sen. Chuck Hagel as defense secretary in part because of claims that hes soft on Israel  the Senate confirmed Hagel with only four Republican votes  Rubio restrained from criticizing Obama, who will make his own visit to Israel next month.While in Jordan, Rubio met with former Syrian Prime Minister Riad Hijab, who defected in August.Rubio said he was told that Syrian rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assad are becoming angry because they feel abandoned by the United States and allied Western nations.Rubio called for extending the current humanitarian aid from Washington to the Syrian Opposition Coalition to include ammunition.We dont have to give them weapons; they have plenty of weapons, he said. What they need is ammunition. They are running low on that.It is vital to U.S. national security, Rubio said, that radical groups dont emerge in control of Syria, especially since, he said, they are being armed by Iran, Hezbollah and other enemies of the United States.We should want the most dominant, best-equipped groups to be the groups that are friendly to our interests and are listening to us, he said.Showing a bit of the quick wit and political adroitness hell need if he runs for president, Rubio made a show at the start of his talk of lifting a pitcher of water and pouring some into a coffee mug.This is a bit much, Rubio said. Why dont we take care of business right away?The audience of diplomats, reporters and Middle East scholars broke up laughing at Rubios antic, which came two weeks after he reached for a water bottle while delivering the Republican response to Obamas State of the Union address  a pause on live TV that immediately went viral on the Internet.In Jordan, Rubio met with King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. He said Wednesday that they are taking tentative steps toward increased democracy in their country to head off the kind of violent uprisings that have occurred in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria as part of the Arab Spring.Rubio said Jordanian opposition leaders expressed skepticism to him over the governments long-term commitment to implementing democratic reforms.Rubio appeared to share some of their fears that the reforms are window dressing and arent real.Im concerned about the pace of reforms, and Im concerned about economic growth as well, Rubio said.That drew a diplomatic rebuke from the monarchys ambassador to the United States, Alia Hatough-Bouran, sitting in the audience, who told Rubio that her government wants to introduce broader reforms.The envoy also said the 400,000 Syrian refugees whove fled war and flooded into Jordan are straining its government.This is one step of many, and we are very much committed to that, Hatough-Bouran said of Ammans early democratic initiatives.In a small test of his response to the kind of increased scrutiny Rubio now faces as a possible presidential aspirant, he quickly retreated from his earlier comments, expressing confidence in Jordans commitment to reform.Dan Schueftan, director of the National Security Studies Center at the University of Haifa in Israel and a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, came away from Rubios 45-minute session impressed by the charismatic Cuban-American senator.Hes a very serious person, Schueftan said of Rubio. Hes very well-informed. I think he has a very coherent picture. I also happen to agree with almost everything he said."\u000a

V"Finding an apartment in Davis is a needle-in-the-haystack quest in a city where the vacancy rate is less than 2 percent for rental properties.But a new affordable housing complex in south Davis  the city's first in five years  is helping more families call Davis home.More than 200 people will soon live in the New Harmony Mutual Housing Community at 3030 Cowell Blvd., which opened Feb. 1.The earth-toned buildings feature solar power to help reduce energy use and utility bills, a garden and play area, a community center and works by local artists. They are also near city transit, and the Davis bike path and greenbelt.The $19 million project came together with a mix of redevelopment money, federal home funding and tax credits.The 69-unit complex should be fully occupied by March, said Rachel Iskow, executive director of Sacramento-based Mutual Housing California, which operates the complex.Individuals and families who earn 30 percent to 60 percent of the area's median income of about $75,000 for a family of four qualify, said Danielle Foster, the city's Housing and Human Services superintendent. Affordable housing has long been an issue in the city. The average monthly rent for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in Davis is $998, Foster said. A two-bedroom place goes for more than $1,300 a month. Tenants pay nearly $1,900 on average for a three-bedroom apartment.Davis appears to recognize the need. A city ordinance requires that 25 percent of all for-sale properties and 35 percent of all rental properties are designated affordable housing.""Housing prices the way they are in Davis, we have to search for ways to provide affordable housing,"" said City Councilman Dan Wolk.Rents at the new complex range from $480 for a one-bedroom to $1,166 for a three-bedroom apartment.On Wednesday, the movers carried mattresses into the apartment of Mattie Henry and her 15-year-old great-niece and adoptive daughter DorMatte, who moved from the Houston area to Davis.""It's so nice and quiet,"" Henry said. ""Everybody has been so helpful  especially when they see me in my wheelchair.""Learning that her apartment  like all in New Harmony  is adaptable for people with physical disabilities was a relief for Henry, 70. Doors are wider, shelves lower, the bath easily accessible. Other units are fully accessible. Four others accommodate the visual and hearing impaired.For DorMatte, it's the chance to have what all teenagers want.""I have my own room,"" she said with a bright smile, busy over the kitchen sink. ""It's, like, mine. Nobody else's."""\u000a

V"IN THE NUBA MOUNTAINS, Sudan  I'd like to introduce a valiant woman here, Mariam Tia, to President Barack Obama and other world leaders, so she could explain how they're allowing Sudan's leaders to get away with mass atrocities that echo Darfur. Once again, in Sudan there are starving children, tens of thousands of refugees, rapes and racial epithets, a spiraling death toll and passivity in the White House. Mariam was pregnant when the Sudanese army invaded her village in the rebel-held Nuba Mountains and shot her husband dead. Enraged, she took over a mounted machine gun set up by rebels and began to rake the soldiers as they burned the village's huts. Mariam said she isn't sure whether she actually shot any soldiers and that soon they began firing back, so she had to run for her life. She eventually relocated to a dank mountain cave, where  like countless other Nubans  she felt a bit safer from random bombings by government warplanes. When her due date came, two months ago, Mariam delivered her baby by herself inside the cave. She named her baby girl Fakao, which is shorthand for: bombs are dropping. When people hear Antonov bombers releasing their payloads, they shout ""Fakao! Fakao!"" That's the signal to huddle behind rocks and hope for the best. ""When this child was in my stomach, I used to run from the bombers,"" Mariam told me as she nursed Fakao in front of her cave. ""I named her this so that I could remember the struggle we went through to give her life.""If I ever see the enemy again,"" she added, ""I will tie this baby to my back and pick up a gun and fight them.""World leaders could use some of that backbone. Instead, they have said little and done almost nothing as President Omar al-Bashir has  for a year now  undertaken daily bombings in the Nuba Mountains and the neighboring Blue Nile region, blocked food from entering, expelled aid groups and tried to bar witnesses. I entered illegally on a dirt track from South Sudan, and, I found that hundreds of thousands of people in the Nuba Mountains have run out of food and are surviving on leaves, wild roots and insects. As I travel about, I find the contrasts heartbreaking. One is the gulf of technology between government forces and their civilian victims: I interview impoverished families huddling in caves and eating leaves and bugs, and our conversations are interrupted by Sudanese MiG or Antonov bombers overhead. Sudan mostly drops bombs full of shrapnel, but it occasionally drops cluster bombs. One woman, Hasia al-Ahmar, told me that her mother had starved to death and then the government dropped a bomb that landed directly on the family's grass-roof mud hut, with her sister inside. ""We could just pick up little pieces of her and put them in a plastic bag,"" she said. ""And then we buried the bag."" The collision between a 21st-century bomb and a village woman in a traditional mud hut  that pretty much captures the horror of what is unfolding now in the Nuba Mountains. The same bombings and starvation also seem to be occurring next door in the Blue Nile region, forcing tens of thousands to flee to South Sudan. Another contrast is between the timidity and fecklessness of world leaders, and the courage and grit of the Nuba people themselves. Take Hamat Dorbet, a 39-year-old evangelical Presbyterian pastor. In an anti-Christian campaign a dozen years ago in this Muslim-dominated country, the authorities began arresting Hamat for ringing his church bell and preaching to his congregation. They would arrest him each Sunday, according to his account and that of neighbors, and then beat and torture him for a few days. Each Sunday, after a few days of recovery, Hamat would struggle back to the church, ring the bell and begin another service. Then police officers would come and drag him out for more torture. Once they shot him, and he almost died. A month after that, when he could move again, he roused himself out of bed one Sunday morning, limped to the church and boldly rang the bell to deliver another service. A peace accord shortly afterward stopped the persecution and, perhaps, saved his life. But these days, Hamat is again struggling to stay alive. Like most of his church members, he has nothing to eat but leaves, roots and insects, and he is fading. And, of course, this is a government-designed famine: In Sudan, ""to starve"" is a transitive verb. Hamat is not asking for help, and he's not feeling sorry for himself. I'd like to explain to him why the world lets this happen without even speaking out strongly, and I just don't know what to say. President Obama?"\u000a

V"GULFPORT, Mississippi  BPs chief of operations for the Gulf cleanup, Mike Utsler, has been on the job since the first days of the spill. Hes shifted it from a major effort in the summer and fall to pulling back as oil residue washing ashore has diminished each month since the winter.Utsler told the Sun Herald on Thursday the last of the focus for cleanup is 550 acres of marsh in Louisiana and the barrier islands, which include the Gulf Islands National Seashore off the Mississippi Coast.Bird-nesting season poses a problem in both those areas, and their sensitive marsh grasses can be damaged by foot traffic.Also a cleanup problem is thick tar mats off the shore of the barrier islands from Florida to Alabama. Twenty to 100 feet in length, the mats rest on the near-shore bottoms, but theyre too far out to reach from shore.Utsler estimates 30 have been identified and documented. Some are not visible, buried under sand, he said.Well continue to test technology to find and remove them, he said.The risk is the mats will break apart and come ashore over time. But he stresses that though some observers describe the mats as looking like road-paving asphalt, hes finding they are weathered oil mixed with sand and likely not harmful to animals or humans.Figures BP released this week: Total of $17.7 billion spent on well shutoff, cleanup and partial financial restoration to the region; 34.7 million gallons of oil and water mix recovered; 11.1 million gallons of oil burned and 92,800 tons of tar balls, oily solids, oiled material and vegetation and oiled protective clothing collected.Utsler said BP will stay until the Gulf is cleaned to pre-spill conditions, but he said he doesnt see workers here five years from now, based on the current level of cleanup.Utsler said independent scientists are not finding oil in the sediment of the Gulf, except within two miles of the wellhead.He said dispersant has since August been below detectable levels and below background levels.To read the complete article, visit www.sunherald.com."\u000a

Runners, slashers, jumpers, spot shooters, rebounders, stoppers, dunkers. Pick your poison.Bee No. 1 Sheldon unleashed its full arsenal again Friday night, taking down another formidable outfit in rival and No. 2 Pleasant Grove for an 85-79 victory in a Delta River League thriller in Elk Grove.Darin Johnson scored 28 points for Sheldon, making 8 of 12 shots, including 3 of 4 from three-point range. The 6-foot-4 senior guard who's headed to Washington via scholarship has range and can dunk.Dakarai Allen, long and lean at 6-6 and bound for San Diego State, has an inside-outside game and showed it with his 22 points. Fellow San Diego State-bound senior D'Erryl Williams, the powerful 6-2 point guard who can post up and defend, scored 18 of his 20 in the second half.Antonio Lewis had 10 points and five rebounds, and Ryan Manning, the fifth starter, had five points and 11 rebounds.How do you defend this group?""You can't,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said. ""You'd have to hope we miss shots. We're hard to match up with when we're playing well.""Pleasant Grove (17-4 overall, 4-1 DRL) gave Sheldon (16-4, 5-0) all it could handle in suffering its first setback of the new year. The Eagles trailed 10-1 early but rallied. Pleasant Grove was down 62-42 late in the third but climbed back.Williams, like he has so many times in his career, helped salt it away in the fourth with post-up moves, and Johnson iced it with four consecutive free throws in the final 40 seconds.Pleasant Grove has lost to two Southern California state powers, as well as Sacramento and Sheldon. Guards Malik Thames and Matt Hayes scored 20 and 15 points for the Eagles. Shooting forward Cole Nordquist had 19, and 6-6 sophomore post Marquese Chriss had 18.""They're a tough matchup for anybody,"" Pleasant Grove coach John DePonte said. ""I'm proud of our guys. We battled. Against a team that talented and that deep, we had our opportunities. It's testament to our kids' character.""Sheldon is state-ranked No. 3 by Cal-High Sports and has just one in-state loss to two-time defending CIF State Division II champion Mitty of San Jose, a game Johnson and Williams missed.Sheldon students packed their side of the gym and engaged in dueling chants with the Pleasant Grove side that occupied every seat. It was a clean game that featured teams that have a great deal of respect for each other. A line stretching well into the parking lot was turned away.""That's the funnest regular-season game I've been a part of,"" said Williams, The Bee Player of the Year last season. ""(Pleasant Grove) is really good. I knew they wouldn't give up. Everyone respects each other, and it was a very clean game."""\u000a

Senior Ware scored 15 points and sophomore Zonyia Cormier 12, but Green created the biggest buzz.It was the junior wing's first appearance in a game since suffering a right knee injury during a summer club tournament.Last season's scoring leader, wearing a bulky brace, entered to fans' cheers late in the third quarter, then capped her brief appearance by hitting a three-pointer just before the buzzer two minutes later.In other quarterfinal games:Division IKennedy 58, Deer Valley-Antioch 52  Jessica Lauderdale and Amayla Greer had big fourth-quarter efforts as the Cougars (25-8) overcame the foul-out by Lynette Johnson to advance to a semifinal.

""We don't get the tallest kids or the superstars. But we do get good, smart kids who have always worked hard and put the time in.""The top-seeded Bruins showed all those attributes in outbattling an Argonaut team that entered 29-0 and with a collective chip on its players' shoulders for a paltry No. 4 seed.But the Bruins compete in a strong Pioneer Valley League that saw fellow tri-champions Colfax and Placer also reach the semifinals in D-IV and D-III, respectively.So despite being held to 10 second-half points and losing its best player, junior forward Kaitlyn Reina, to fouls midway in the fourth quarter, Bear River prevailed in typical fashion.Unsung Maddi Dunn and Cindy Solomon, who had combined for three points in regulation, combined for five to open the overtime and that would prove enough.Sarah Hagar led Bear River (26-3) with 12 points, and Savannah Welz had 11 as the Bruins celebrated their 65th section playoff win. They will play No. 3 Bradshaw Christian on Saturday at 11:30 a.m. at Sleep Train Arena.""I'm really happy for our three seniors (Solomon, Welz and Hagar),"" said Bickmore, who won D-IV section titles in 2006 and 2007 after Duwaine Ganskie, now the boys coach, won a total of eight in two divisions from 1990 to 1998.In other Division IV games at Tokay:Bradshaw Christian 51, Colfax 46 (girls)  Baskets by Erika Bean and Jordyn Bell enabled the third-seeded Pride to hold off the second-seeded Falcons after Taylor Avila's all-net three-pointer closed Colfax within 47-46 with 2:06 to play.

Several students took a weekend trip to the small northern Portuguese town of Porto to enjoy some warm weather in February. I thought the two boats, loaded with wine kegs, showed off the beauty of the Douro River near our apartment. You can easily walk the town in one day, but be aware that it has many steep hills.

V"If you've ever seen members of a great basketball team working together, you understand a physical poetry unlike any other.Imagine Magic Johnson leading a fast break with James Worthy and Byron Scott on the wings. All great players, but together, as Aristotle once said, ""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."" Those Lakers, called ""Showtime,"" seem an apt analogy to ""The Price"" at the B Street Theatre, which could be called ""Theatertime.""Director Buck Busfield has revived Arthur Miller's 1968 four-character ""The Price,"" stocking the B3 Stage drama with an ensemble of superior actors who create a spellbinding night of theater. David Pierini, Brian Dykstra, David Silberman and Elisabeth Nunziato populate the play, which takes place in one room in the real time of two hours.The ""price"" of the play's title refers to several ideas in the narrative, but mostly it's about what people end up paying for the choices they make. Pierini's Victor is a New York City cop on the verge of retirement  or at least his wife, Esther (Nunziato), wants him to be. Victor wanted a career in science but put that dream on hold to support and take care of his father, who lost his fortune in the stock market crash of 1929. He and Esther have come to the father's old apartment to sell the family furniture.Esther seems like the most interesting character of them all. She drinks a little more than she should, perhaps because she put away her ambitions for a life less normal when Victor joined the police force. Nunziato invests her loyalty to him and hope for their future with a vibrant urgency. Dykstra's Walter, on the other hand, went off to college and became an extremely successful surgeon in the city. He turns up unexpectedly at the old apartment hoping to make his peace with his brother Victor.The familiar but explosive dynamic between the two estranged siblings revolves around who sacrificed for the family and who didn't. The fascinating complexity of the play, though, lies in the accusations of selfishness and assumptions of victimhood that aren't nearly as obvious or simple as they initially seem.Besides the personal cost of their life choices, ""The Price"" also refers to what Silberman's appraiser, Gregory, will offer for the family possessions. The veteran actor Silberman has become a local treasure, never more sublime than he is here, slyly slipping in and out of the desperate, primal family dispute. As the story unfolds in the apartment (Samantha Reno designed the wonderfully askew set) the actors sink into the heart of what theater can be. Pierini's intractable Victor and Dykstra's realistic Walter are brothers with a hopelessly convoluted past. We see real people, complicated and flawed, trying to extend beyond themselves and perhaps rectify mistakes. They fumble with simple aspirations within their grasp, and we lean forward, hoping they will somehow reach them.The PriceFour starsWhat: Arthur Miller's 1968 family drama receives a revival from B Street Theatre with Dave Pierini, Brian Dykstra, Elisabeth Nunziato and David Silberman.

V"When Chad Allan and the Expressions, having achieved some success with a cover of ""Shakin' All Over"" in the band's native Canada, released a full-length album, the record company wanted to create a buzz.Maybe buyers would snatch up the album if an air of secrecy surrounded the band. Maybe they even would think the album came from a famous British Invasion band. After all, the music was similar.Consequently, the album's cover listed the band's name as ""Guess Who?"" That became the band's name.The current manifestation of the Canadian Invasion band plays at Jackson Rancheria tonight.It took the Guess Who a few more albums to break into the United States market. The band's third album, ""Wheatfield Soul,"" yielded the hit ""These Eyes."" But the band did not become big here until the title track from its 1970 album ""American Woman"" hit No. 1. It is largely because of the immense popularity of that song that the Guess Who continues to perform today.The current lineup consists of drummer Garry Peterson and bassist Jim Kale, who are original members, and lead guitarist Laurie MacKenzie, keyboardist Leonard Shaw and lead vocalist Derek Sharp.

V"It has developed into the monster high school boys basketball event of the summer.The fifth annual Sheldon-Trail Summer Jam on Friday through Sunday will feature 60 teams and 175 games at four Elk Grove-area schools. It's the largest non-Amateur Athletic Union summer boys basketball tournament in Northern California, said tournament co-director and Monterey Trail coach Ken Manfredi.Teams scheduled to compete include defending section champions Sheldon (Division I), Antelope (D-II) and Foothill (D-III). Twelve teams that finished in The Bee's top 20 are entered.Pleasant Grove, El Cerrito, Chico and Campolindo of Moraga, all participants in last season's CIF Northern California playoffs, also are entered.Another team to watch will be Central of Fresno, which lost in last season's D-I Central Section semifinals to Bullard of Fresno.Central is coached by Loren LeBeau, a disciple of Vance Walberg, creator of the up-tempo, Dribble-Drive Motion offense that so many teams use today.While Central figures to be in the title mix and Antelope is the defending champion, Sheldon is considered the tournament favorite.The Huskies won the 32-team Valley-CRC Summer Showcase earlier this month, beating defending D-III NorCal champion Sacred Heart Cathedral of San Francisco in the final. Sunday, the Huskies beat Bellarmine of San Jose 64-47 in the championship of the highly competitive Dougherty Valley Summer Shootout in San Ramon. State champions Archbishop Mitty of San Jose and Salesian of Richmond also were in the 40-team field.Pool play for the Sheldon-Trail tournament will be Friday and Saturday at Sheldon, Monterey Trail and Elk Grove high schools and at Smedberg Middle School.The top 12 teams will advance to the single-elimination Platinum Tournament on Sunday at Sheldon starting at 8 a.m., with the title game at 6 p.m.Also Sunday, Gold and Bronze tournaments will be held at Monterey Trail; a Silver tournament at Elk Grove; and a Copper tournament at Smedberg.All games will feature 20-minute halves with a running clock. The clock will stop in the final two minutes if teams are within 10 points of one another.All-day admission each day is $6 for adults; $4 for seniors 60 and older; $3 for children 5 to 12 (4 and younger free).""This is biggest fundraiser of the year for both of us, and it beats selling candy or coupon books,"" said Manfredi, who runs the tournament with Sheldon coach Joey Rollings. ""We've gone from being a competitive local tournament to being a competitive regional tournament.""Titans expect challenges  Despite having two of the best big men in Northern California, Antelope boys basketball coach Rob Richards thinks last year's 30-win season is going to be impossible to replicate  and not just because his Titans graduated their top four guards.""Everything fell into place last season,"" Richards said of his D-II section championship team that went 30-2. ""But now we have a tougher schedule, and we're no longer sneaking up on anybody.""Antelope, which returns 6-foot-6 post Isaiah Ellis and 6-5 forward Gabe Bealer, will play in early December in the 59th annual Gridley Invitational Basketball Tournament  one of Northern California's top events  and later that month in the MaxPreps Holiday Classic in Palm Desert.Bullard bullish in Rocklin  Fresno boys basketball power Bullard won Sunday's Sac Area Summer Showcase at the Hardwood Palace in Rocklin.Bullard defeated the NorCal Elite 72-57 in the Gold Bracket title game.Oak Ridge defeated Rio Americano 47-37 for the Silver Bracket championship."\u000a

They nosed out perennial league and Sac-Joaquin Section powers Pleasant Grove and Sheldon.""We may have been a little bit of a surprise,"" said Brekke, a 55-year-old retired contractor now working as a campus monitor at Ponderosa. ""But credit the girls for all their hard work. The chemistry is really good on this team. We have 14 players, and they all add value and have accepted their roles.""Ponderosa athletic director Tyson Escobar thinks Brekke, the Bruins' second-year coach, deserves some props, too.""Dwayne did a great job with the team,"" Escobar said in an email. ""They were never expected to make the playoffs, but with constant positive encouragement and hard work, they persevered through a very difficult league schedule.""Ponderosa found the going rough last season in its maiden voyage in the Delta River League, which some have dubbed the ""Super League"" because it has produced four of the past five section D-I champions.Despite a 16-7 record, Ponderosa in 2011 finished fifth in the league at 4-6 and failed to make the postseason for the first time in five seasons.This year, Ponderosa (17-7) won the league with an 8-2 record, one game ahead of Pleasant Grove. On May 9, the Bruins won a 1-0 thriller at St. Francis on the last day of league play.That win ended St. Francis' playoff hopes and allowed defending section champion Sheldon to back into the postseason as the league's No. 3 seed. Pleasant Grove beat Sheldon 4-2 on a two-out, walk-off grand slam by freshman Kaylen Minnatee the same day.Ponderosa put Sheldon in a pickle by twice beating the Huskies and Arizona State-bound ace Alexis Cooper. It was after their 16-hit, 9-0 win over Sheldon on April 18 that the Bruins realized they might do better than just make the playoffs.Opposing coaches, including Sheldon's Mary Jo Truesdale and Bear River's Duane Zauner, came away impressed with Ponderosa's aggressiveness at the plate. But while the Bruins led the Delta River League in hitting with a .334 average, they also were No. 1 in fielding percentage and ERA.Brekke started with a three-pitcher rotation before junior Paris Hallums (10-1, 0.91 ERA) won too many big games to be denied the ace role.""Whenever she gets in a tough jam, she bears down and gets tougher,"" Brekke said.While several other juniors and sophomores have stepped in and played beyond their years, it's senior left fielder Natalie Kessing and senior catcher Skye Jerpbak who provide talent, mettle and leadership.The left-handed-hitting Kessing, who sprays the ball to all fields, is batting .493. Jerpbak is averaging .407 at the plate while calling almost all the pitches behind it.Jerpbak has a 4.46 grade-point average and will play next season in the Ivy League.""She's extremely bright,"" Brekke said. ""She picked Princeton over MIT.""Ponderosa's league championship was the fifth in school history and first in D-I.Now, the Bruins will try their postseason luck in D-I for the first time.Ponderosa's only section title came in 1980, the inaugural season of D-II. The Bruins were D-II runners-up in 2002 and 2007."\u000a

Sergio Alvarez, 37, made a brief appearance Wednesday afternoon in Yolo Superior Court in Woodland. Alvarez is being held in lieu of $29.3 million bail in Solano County custody on allegations that include rape, sodomy and kidnapping involving six women while on duty between October 2011 and September 2012. Alvarez had been a member of the West Sacramento Police Department since 2007. A grand jury that convened last weekend came back with the indictment on Sunday. Police arrested Alvarez on Monday and he was fired by the department the same day. Alvarezs attorney, Erin Dervin, asked to delay Wednesdays slated arraignment until March 7.

V"Congress on Thursday gave Indian tribes new power to prosecute non-Indians in tribal courts for any crimes linked to domestic violence.Ending a 16-month battle with the Senate, the House of Representatives voted 286-138 to approve the plan as part of an expansion of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act. Republican opponents relented after failing to win enough votes to reauthorize the law without the provision. The bill now goes to President Barack Obama, who said hed sign it.Im ecstatic, said Deborah Parker, the 42-year-old vice chairwoman of the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, who came to the Capitol last year to recount how shed been sexually and physical abused while growing up on the reservation.Parker and other tribal officials lobbied hard for a new law in response to a 1978 Supreme Court ruling that tribes had no authority to try or punish non-Indians. The case involved a Washington state man whom the Suquamish Indian Tribe ordered to appear in tribal court after he was cited on charges of resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.This is a long-delayed and hard-won victory for millions of women in this country, said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, who made the issue a top priority after Congress allowed the law to expire in 2011.The law, once signed, will allow tribes to try non-Indians only for rape and other crimes involving domestic abuse. While many opponents say the reauthorized law would be unconstitutional, backers say a narrow expansion probably would survive a court challenge.Backers of the new law say its needed because too many local authorities dont want to investigate crimes committed on reservations. And they say the situation has become severe: Indian women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average, and more than one in three will be raped in their lifetimes, according to the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. That rape rate is twice as high as it is for other ethnicities.The bill also would expand federal investigative assistance to include gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender victims and would allow more illegal immigrants who are victimized to get temporary visas to stay in the United States. Murray estimated that at least 30 million more women will be eligible for help.In a statement, Obama credited the Violence Against Women Act with saving countless lives and changing the way the nation has responded to domestic abuse.Renewing this bill is an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear, and I look forward to signing it into law as soon as it hits my desk, the president said.Republican Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington state said there is no doubt that the law would be struck down, and he accused Democrats of hijacking the law to advance other political agendas. He said hed always voted to reauthorize the law before but that it had gotten caught up in a political stampede this time around.In a tribal court, constitutional protections and the Bill of Rights do not apply, Hastings said. Under the bill, a non-Indian citizen tried in a tribal court has no right to appeal to a federal court, lacks the guarantee of due process, has no right to an impartial jury of ones peers and more. A vote in favor of the bill was a vote to deny U.S. citizens their Bill of Rights.Congress spent much of the last session at loggerheads over the issue, with Murray and other Democrats accusing Republicans of dragging their feet in protecting women.After the Senate voted 78-22 two weeks ago to reauthorize the bill as one of its first acts in the new Congress, it became clear that Republicans wanted to avoid a replay of the fight.The House voted on two bills: In the first, 60 Republicans joined Democrats to defeat an amendment that would have reauthorized the law without adding the extra protections for Indian women, immigrants and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender victims. In the second, 87 Republicans backed the broader Senate bill.Murray credited moderate House Republicans as helping to turn the tide by demanding a vote on the Senate plan.Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said shed backed the Senate plan as a way to help more children escape domestic violence. She told the story of a little boy who died when he was struck and killed after jumping out of a car on a freeway when his mothers boyfriend began beating her.Freshman Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the story of his 5-year-old son, whom he and his wife adopted three years ago: The boy had watched his stepfather beat his mother for half an hour, killing her.I know the scourge of violence against women personally, Cramer said.Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen recalled a case in 2000 in his district in northwestern Washington in which an immigrant woman named Anastasia King was murdered by her husband.Domestic violence does not discriminate. With this bill, domestic violence protection will no longer discriminate, Larsen said.Backers of the law said they wouldnt have prevailed if they hadnt been able to put a human face on domestic abuse. Murray, in particular, had urged victims to go public.After the vote, Murray said Parkers story  she appeared with Murray and other Democratic senators at a Capitol Hill news conference  had played a key role in getting the law reauthorized.Parker said her abuse began when she was a toddler and happened repeatedly until the summer after third grade. But she said it was never reported to police because they wouldnt have bothered to investigate anyway. I think Deborah Parker made the absolute difference at the absolute critical time, being here, standing up and making her personal story become the face of what this was about, Murray said. It was an act of courage and it changed the whole debate."\u000a

Laws died April 3, 1966, when the naval fighter pilot's aircraft was hit by enemy fire and crashed in North Vietnam.""After making a strafing run on the target, Lt. Laws radioed that his aircraft had been hit,"" reads a military report on his death. ""Twenty seconds later, his flight lead observed Laws' aircraft impact a hillside and explode.""The report goes on to state that a parachute was observed but it was not used. No further radio contact was received from the 26-year-old Laws after impact.A memorial service a few days after the crash was held at Miramar Naval Air Station Chapel near San Diego.After the war ended, on three separate occasions, different joint teams of Vietnamese and Americans visited the crash site, gathering remains.However, nothing was to come of those remains recovery missions until the science of DNA typing had advanced to the point that a match was made with a relative of Laws.""It looks like DNA technology was not quite where it could identify the remains that were recovered until 2011,"" said Air Force Maj. Carie Parker, a public affairs officer with the Defense Prisoner of War-Missing Personnel Office.With Laws officially coming off the books as missing in action, the family of the late naval officer will gather on May 10 in Annapolis, Md., at the Naval Academy in the chapel, where a funeral for the pilot will be held 47 years after his death.His widow, Karen Laws Engelke, who once made a pilgrimage to her first husband's crash site, last week recalled his death and spoke about the importance of the upcoming services.She described him as a serious man with a dry sense of humor. Thin, athletic and bright, he ran cross country in high school.He always wanted to fly and could fix any car. Laws graduated high in his academy class.When he died, Laws was on his second tour of duty, his unit named Attack Squadron 24 on board the USS Hancock. Engelke remembered her husband had grown weary of war.""Dick was a very tired young man,"" she said. ""He had to buck up every single day to get into that plane to take off.""He wanted to be home, she said. His plane had never been hit before the fatal event, but several in his squadron had sustained damage.""I was worried every day,"" she said. ""After he came back from the first tour, he had nightmares about being captured.""She remarried in 1971; her second husband, Edwin Engelke, died of cancer.Engelke said that in 2006, she and her daughter and a grandson went to Vietnam to the crash site. The pilgrimage brought them to a rural village called Xuan Du, about 45 minutes by car from the end of the paved road.""It was extraordinary,"" said Engelke. ""We were met in a village council chambers and then we hiked up this pretty steep hill.""She brought with her 357 memorial ribbons attached to a pole from all kinds of people, including Laws' classmates and friends. All the ribbons had messages, some in Vietnamese.She tied it to a tree at the crash site and a few words were said.Engelke is glad that the remains were recovered to honor her late husband. Her children, who were very young when their father was killed, turned out to ""be pretty cool people,"" she said.Their son, Richard, an Army veteran, is a physician. Their daughter, Cheryl, once a Naval aviator, is employed in the nuclear shipping industry.""Dick had a great smile, which his son has now,"" she said."\u000a

V"Allie Green remembers the emotions that swirled through her mind after a ligament in her left knee snapped during an Amateur Athletic Union basketball tournament two summers ago in Oregon.""The first thing I thought was that I'd never be able to play basketball again  that I'd never be as good a player as I was before,"" said Green, a senior at Sacramento High School. ""But what really tore me down was that basketball is the thing I love the most  it's what gets me away from problems, emotions and stuff. I thought that had been taken away from me, too. It devastated me.""Brianna Ruiz, Green's AAU teammate, had similar thoughts when her right knee gave out last summer in a club tournament in Las Vegas.""It was crazy because I wasn't pushed or anything; my knee just collapsed,"" said Ruiz, a senior at Del Oro. ""I fell right in front of the college coaches that were sitting there, and the knee hurt really bad.  I'm thinking, 'Oh, crap, is this going to affect anything?' ""Other than a symbolic 90-second appearance in a late-season playoff game, Green missed her entire junior season at Sac High after being an All-Metro Conference selection as a sophomore.Ruiz, a Bee All-Metro first-team selection last season, is now dealing with the same prospect. After three years starring for the Golden Eagles, Ruiz likely will be limited to rooting for her teammates from the bench.But Ruiz and Green are fortunate in several ways.Anterior cruciate ligament surgery once meant a near-certain end of an athlete's playing days, especially for a female. That's no longer the case because of improvements in medical and rehab procedures.""It used to be that people who got an ACL injury didn't come back as fast, and sometimes they didn't come back at all,"" said Sac High's Michele Massari, who coached the AAU team Green and Ruiz played on this summer and once played at Nevada Union. ""Back in the day, you'd see girls who had knee surgery, and they just weren't the same.""Pepperdine coach supportiveThe injuries barely caused a blip in Green's and Ruiz's recruitment.Two of Northern California's biggest college recruits said interest remained just as strong after they were hurt, and Ruiz signed with Washington and Green with Pepperdine in November. Between them, they had more than 30 major-college offers.""I had 11 or 12 offers before I got hurt, and they all stayed with me. They kept calling to see how I was doing,"" said Green, a 5-foot-10 guard.Green had developed a strong relationship with the Pepperdine coaching staff while attending a summer camp. When Waves coach Julie Rousseau checked in with Green, she offered some real-life experience.""She also had torn her ACL,"" Green said of Rousseau, who played at UC Irvine. ""So she knew things would be tough and that I'd have to have a strong mindset and work hard to get through it. But she kept looking at the positives rather than the negatives, and that helped me.""Ruiz, a 5-11 guard, continued to be recruited during the fall, even after her August surgery.Recruiters from Pacific-12 Conference schools, Kansas, Louisville and other teams would stop by Del Oro or watch Ruiz coach and train a youth girls team in Rocklin. She said she had 21 Division I offers and no one stopped recruiting her after the injury.""With a typical athlete, you might see half the recruiters back off,"" said Mike Takayama, who has coached girls basketball at Del Oro for 27 seasons. ""But athletes like Allie Green and Brianna are so physically superior that colleges feel they are more than worth the risk.""Ruiz said she chose Washington because she liked the area, the school, the coaches and a team that appears on the rise after going 20-14 last season.""I feel like I can make an impact there,"" she said.Green advises RuizGreen and Ruiz say they are physically stronger because of rehab and more aware of the importance of strength training, especially for knees.Green works three days a week with former NFL football player Alex Van Dyke, an area trainer who also works with the Sac High team.""I'm extremely stronger,"" said Green, who wears a knee brace for extra support.Ruiz already was in great shape as a three-sport athlete (volleyball and track and field) at Del Oro. But physical therapy is ""making me all-around better.""It also has Ruiz thinking she might be able to pull an Adrian Peterson  the star Minnesota Vikings running back tore his ACL and MCL on Christmas Eve and was playing in September  and make a comeback this season.""I feel great right now,"" Ruiz said. ""If all continues to go well, and my therapist clears me, I think I could come back and play.""That idea doesn't sit well with Takayama, however.""We definitely miss her, and she's in practice every day knocking down shots from every angle,"" Takayama said. ""But I'd feel terrible if she got hurt. I don't want to jeopardize her scholarship in any way.""Green also is trying to keep the reins on her friend.""She knows how much I love to play, but she keeps telling me to slow it down, to take my time,"" Ruiz said. ""But the first tournament (in Sonora) was heartbreaking. It was really hard not being out there.""Green had similar feelings watching her teammates win a Sac-Joaquin Section Division III championship without her last season, but she said that discomfort was nothing compared to when she saw Ruiz go down with her injury during their AAU game.""It made me sick,"" Green said. ""It was kind of mind-boggling for me because I know the feeling. Now whenever I see someone grab their knee, it makes me ill."""\u000a

There will most likely be a Beethoven sonata, a Csar Franck sonata and a Giuseppe Tartini piece called the ""Devil's Trill Sonata,"" along with some of what Perlman calls ""virtuoso smaller pieces.""""How do you decide a program? I'll want to play what I'll want to hear,"" he said.One of the lesser-known composers, Tartini, lived in the 18th century and had a dream one night that the devil appeared to him and he made a pact for his soul. When he gave the devil his violin to see if he could play it, Tartini was astounded at the beauty of the music produced.He awoke to write down what he could remember, and ""Devil's Trill"" was the result, a piece he always considered his best. Perlman calls it ""a nice baroquish piece.""There is also always a possibility the audience will hear a suite from the film ""Schindler's List,"" for which Perlman recorded solo violin pieces. He thinks it ""amazing that it has caught on so incredibly. I always call John Williams after I play it and tell him how wonderfully it was received. It is a beautiful piece of music.""This will be Perlman's third visit to Reno for an Artown concert.""But as one gets older, everything becomes a jumble. I played one place recently and commented that I had never been there before. 'You played here last year,' they told me.""As for anybody he might yearn to play with, no name comes to mind.""They are all dead. I would have liked to play with Toscanini conducting. I would have liked to play with Arthur Rubenstein, but wait, I actually did. It was, however, not formal, more like a jam session.""(Feb. 14; 8 p.m.; Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Reno; $75, $115; pioneercenter.com or 775-686-6600)Out and about The first of what North Lake Tahoe hopes will be an annual event takes place today through Sunday at the Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area in Tahoe City.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/04/17/4419385/hometown-report-jackie-robinson.html,"Well before he broke the color barrier in major league baseball with his Brooklyn Dodgers debut 65 years ago last Sunday, Jackie Robinson marched through Sacramento.Soared, actually.In 1937, Robinson won the long jump with a leap of 22 feet, 6 inches for Pasadena City College in the first night track and field meet at Sacramento Stadium (now Hughes Stadium).Remarkably, Robinson wasn't even the most decorated family member at the event. His older brother, Mack, an Olympic silver-medalist runner the year before, won four events in the sprints and jumps. Jackie Robinson later set the junior college national record in the long jump at 25-6 1/3.Speaking of Robinson, one of his teammates when he broke in with the Dodgers was third baseman Spider Jorgensen. He played at Folsom High School and Sacramento City College and also made his big-league debut that day in 1947 after being called up hours earlier from the minors in Montreal. Said Jorgensen in a decades-old interview: ""I came to Ebbets Field on Opening Day scared to death. I didn't think I was going to play. I didn't have any equipment with me. My glove, bats, everything  Jackie comes over and says, 'Here, use my second-base glove,' and I'm in the lineup."" Jorgensen died in 2003, three days after his 84th birthday and four days after scouting a game for the Chicago Cubs. He said years ago that he first learned of Robinson while a senior at Folsom in 1938, Robinson's second year at Pasadena, and they later became longtime friends.Remembering Bud HenleFuneral services were held Sunday in Davis for Bud Henle, a Davis High School football coaching and teaching icon from the 1950s into the 1980s. Henle, 88, died April 6. A classic old-school coach  gruff and growling  he was beloved after retirement by former players and students.At Davis, Henle mentored players such as Dave Whitmire, Bob Johnson and Ralph Villanueva, successful athletes who later returned to coach at Davis.""Mr. Blue Devil, that's who Bud was,"" said Whitmire, who coached at Davis in the 1980s and '90s with Johnson and Villanueva as his assistants. ""Gave me my first job in 1969. I used to take him fishing. He loved that. He loved coaching. He'll be missed.""Longtime Davis Enterprise columnist Bob Dunning recently wrote that his lasting memory was of Henle fishing  casting a line into the middle of the street in Davis from his A Street home.""Practice,"" Henle explained to Dunning, his puzzled kids in tow. ""You always have to practice.""Battenberg steps downTerry Battenberg, a championship high school basketball coach in this region since the 1960s, has stepped down at Capital Christian despite a 26-6 season.Known as a superb teacher of the game with a wry sense of humor, Battenberg won league championships at Jesuit, El Dorado, Ponderosa and Union Mine  the Highway 50 circuit, he called it  and guided a young Capital Christian team that featured just two seniors to the Sac-Joaquin Section Division V title in March. It was his first section championship and the first for the school.Battenberg said he wants to spend time with his wife, Barbara, who is retiring from teaching at Sierra College this spring."\u000a

V"Jesuit answered the skeptics in a big way Saturday at Rio Americano in its season debut: Power football is in and finesse is out under new coach Marlon Blanton, the De La Salle of Concord veer offense disciple.Ben Parietti rushed for three touchdowns, Austin Gates caught two touchdown passes, and Andrew Hoy kicked a 51-yard field goal as the No. 17 Marauders beat their down-the-block neighbors 45-7 in front of a spill-over crowd.Eleven Marauders rushed a combined 35 times for 239 yards, and starting quarterback Tom Sperbeck and reserve Jason Elenberger threw only nine passes, combining to complete four for 64 yards.Jesuit's defense was just as dominant, making four sacks, forcing three turnovers (interceptions by Tyler Marshall and Kent Presson and a fumble recovery by Matt Ternan) and tackling Raiders rushers behind the line of scrimmage eight times.Even some gutsy play by Rio Americano quarterback Mark Lyon (16-for-24 passing, 178 yards and one touchdown and 11 carries for 28 yards) couldn't put a dent in the Marauders' fun or prevent the Raiders from falling to 0-2.""We've been together only 2 1/2 to three months, so we're still in the learning phase,"" said Blanton, who played and coached at De La Salle under the legendary Bob Ladouceur. ""But I can't complain when you score almost every series and fumble one time. Usually with this system, I'm used to seeing a lot of miscues early. Not bad for a first game.""Blanton was quickly hired in the spring after longtime coach Dan Carmazzi, who molded a number of outstanding quarterbacks in winning 230 games through the years, returned to Christian Brothers, his alma mater. He is a Falcons assistant coach.""We were a little hesitant at first with the sudden change,"" said 6-foot-3, 285-pound senior tackle Garrett Strohmaier. ""But as soon as we met coach Blanton and the other coaches, we knew that this was the way to go. Everyone on the team has bought into the system.""Sperbeck and Strohmaier say they're better conditioned and practices are more intense and focused.Strohmaier also contends the physically demanding veer better fits his aggressive nature.""It's great for me as a lineman because I get to show my quickness and athleticism,"" he said.As the quarterback, Sperbeck has had to make the biggest adjustment and, perhaps, the largest sacrifice.He averaged 189 total yards a game operating out of the spread for last season's 5-6 team. Saturday, he was 3 for 6 for 55 yards and rushed twice for two yards, though the Marauders didn't need to air it out much after jumping to a quick 14-0 first-quarter lead.""The offense is looking great,"" Sperbeck said. ""It's coming along the way we expected. I think we're making a great transition.""Blanton is appreciative of the players' open-mindedness, especially knowing that ""The Journey""  the theme for his team  only gets more challenging in the weeks ahead.Still ahead is a sure-to-be-even-more-emotional Holy Bowl against Christian Brothers on Sept. 15; a nonleague game against No. 7 Franklin on Sept. 21; then league play against No. 4 Pleasant Grove, No. 10 Folsom and No. 11 Oak Ridge.""I want to thank the players for receiving us and being so open in this short period of time,"" Blanton said. ""We've been riding the up-and-down wave, but they've been hanging in there with us."""\u000a

V"NORCAL REGIONAL MATCHUPSThe Bee's Joe Davidson previews the NorCal Regional championship football games this weekend:  OPEN DIVISIONDe La Salle (13-0) vs. Folsom (14-0), Saturday, Sacramento State, 7:30 p.m.Welcome to perhaps the biggest high school event in area history, and welcome the national superpower Spartans of Concord, who have not lost to a Northern California team since 1991 (235-0) and are 31-0 lifetime against Sac-Joaquin Section teams since Bob Ladouceur became the coach in 1979. So does Folsom have a shot? With its coaching staff, offensive line, skill players and sound defense, absolutely. But Folsom can't expect to go for it on fourth and nine from its 30 against De La Salle. Folsom's Jake Browning (4,906 passing yards, 61 touchdowns) is closing in on state passing and touchdown records, but he will face a defense with four college Division I recruits, including linebackers Michael Hutchings (bound for USC) and Victor Egu (headed to Cal).  DIVISION IGranite Bay (11-3) vs. St. Ignatius (10-3), tonight, Sacramento State, 7:30 p.m.Never mind the combined six losses; what's most telling is how these teams have done in the playoffs. Granite Bay is the two-time defending Sac-Joaquin Section Division I champion, thanks to strong line play, the fly offense and a physical defense anchored by linebackers Beau Hershberger, Cameron Smith and Mason Conen. St. Ignatius of San Francisco, which won the Central Coast Section Open title for the first time, has a storied history; quarterback Dan Fouts led the Wildcats to the national No. 1 ranking in 1967.  DIVISION IIISutter (13-0) vs. Marin Catholic (13-1), Saturday, Oroville, 7:30 p.m.This showdown is nearly in Sutter's backyard, thanks to a favorable Harrison Stadium bid. Marin Catholic, led by Cal-bound quarterback Jared Goff (3,244 passing yards, 34 touchdowns) and running back Akili Terry (1,691 yards, 25 touchdowns), has won 11 consecutive games since falling to Vacaville 28-24. Sutter, a longtime small-school power in the Northern Section, has excelled with its wing-T behind Nathan Ahlers (1,369 yards, 25 touchdowns), Mat Sanders (1,014 and 10) and quarterback Trent Little (1,349 passing yards, 16 touchdowns)."\u000a

V"The shocking upsets in baseball earlier this week spilled over to softball Friday at the Sacramento Softball Complex.Unranked, under-the-radar Christian Brothers defeated Del Oro 8-3, knocking The Bee's No. 1-ranked team out of the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II playoffs.That upset followed No. 1 Pleasant Grove and No. 2 Jesuit being toppled in the baseball playoffs.Christian Brothers lost two of its last three games in Capital Valley Conference play, barely landed the league's No. 3 seed and had to beat McClatchy in an outbracket game Tuesday.Christian Brothers also hadn't been to the softball postseason in years and was a combined 43-119-2 in the seven previous seasons.But the Falcons, a mix of hungry-for-success seniors and talented underclass players, hit Del Oro ace Jordan Courage hard and often, and took advantage of sloppy Golden Eagles defense.Meanwhile, sophomore pitcher Haley Snyder, who struck out 18 in a game earlier this season, turned in a gutsy performance. She struck out six and scattered six hits while also going 3 for 4 with an RBI.Senior second baseman Inaya Norman had two hits and drove in two runs, and senior outfielder Gisselle Jimenez had two hits and drove in a run. Christian Brothers (17-11) will play CVC rival Del Campo today at 3 p.m. as the tournament shifts to double elimination. Del Oro concludes 19-5-2.""It's just like our kids and Jesuit for baseball or football. In softball, everyone gets up for Del Oro,"" Falcons coach Chad Clay said. ""Frankly, Del Oro played a little flat. We finished third and struggled to get in here.  But upsets happen.""Clay has coached softball for 40 years, including the last four at CBS. He said his first team in 2009 finished the season with nine players.Norman, a captain, remembers the lean times. She has been a starter for four seasons.""For the seniors, we were tired of not making the playoffs,"" said Norman, who will play softball next season at Howard. ""So we're here to take full advantage of our opportunity. We've known all year we had the potential to do something special.""In other Friday games: Defending D-II champion Casa Roble rallied to beat Roseville 6-5 on Krystal Aubert's two-run single in the fourth inning. Lexi Wilkerson struck out 12 and allowed two hits as Woodcreek beat Kennedy 3-0 in D-II. Makayla Props homered and had two doubles in Del Campo's 15-10 win over Rosemont. Benicia, leading 4-1 in the fifth inning of the D-III game, was awarded a forfeit win when the umpire ejected Woodland coach Mieko Mendenhall and there was no Wolves assistant coach available for the game to continue. Senior Stephanie Ceo went 3 for 3, and senior Alyssa Reina drove in three runs in Bear River's 8-2 win over Antelope. Kayli Shaw's run-scoring sacrifice fly proved the difference in Whitney's 3-2 win over River Valley. Vanden upset Tri-County Conference champion Pioneer 5-4."\u000a

V"The Correa name resonates at McClatchy High School.Brothers Dom and Howie Correa spearheaded championship baseball teams two decades ago, including Howie and friends beating CC Sabathia of Vallejo to win the 1998 Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship.Their father, Steve, has been a decades-long fixture as a youth coach and mentor to those who fed into the Freeport Blvd. school.These days, it's Greg Correa, the nephew of Dom and Howie and Steve's grandson, who has inspired his teammates with a refocused effort in the classroom and bulldog results on the mound.Now competing in the Division II postseason, Correa came on in relief and put the clamps on free-swinging Oakmont by retiring seven of the nine batters he faced in a 6-5 opening-round playoff victory Friday night at American River College.A stout 6-foot-1 senior, Correa picked off the only man who had a hit against him, and he struck out two in the seventh inning for the Metro Conference champions.His face beamed with relief and pride, and his coaches raved about Correa's academic drive to match his athletic feats. Correa had to take extra classes to get back on track. He had considered getting his GED instead of finishing school, but coach Mike de Necochea and his teammates convinced him to remain a Lion. He has been working with teachers and counselors ever since.""I had to get on it academically, and I realized that education is important and graduating with these guys would be special,"" Correa said. ""And baseball is something I live for. I'll never forget this. It's all come together.""Said de Necochea: ""Greg stuck with it, a testament to him. He's a hard-luck story who earned this. He's been our big guy.""McClatchy also is known for being an academic powerhouse with its renowned Humanities and International Studies Program (HISP).Senior leaders Alex Jang, Rod Mackey, Kevin Krause and Kenny Nishimura are all HISP students with 4.0 grade-point averages and headed to college.The team's power and personality come from another good student in Jared James, a senior slugger who expects to be drafted next month.Add it up, and it's no wonder the Lions are all grins.""We can be pretty good,"" de Necochea said.Nelson Muniz and Nishimura each had two hits. Muniz's RBI double gave the Lions a 5-4 fourth-inning lead, and James had a groundout RBI in the fifth to make it 6-5.Jimmy Lunardelli, Justin Garvin and Robert Walton combined for seven hits for Oakmont, which bid farewell to retiring coach Dean Perkins. Perkins made the playoffs 17 times in 25 seasons.Granite Bay 11, Del Campo 3  Sophomore designated hitter Devin Lehman has a three-run double in the first inning and a three-run triple in the second, and Brendan Keeney tossed five consecutive shutout innings for the Grizzlies to improve his record to 6-0.Four Del Campo pitchers surrendered 13 walks. Mitch Hart had two RBIs for the Grizzlies, who made some spectacular defensive plays, including second baseman Vinny Esposito, the son of veteran coach Pat Esposito.

V"Coaches call them effort players. Tireless pests hustling overtime to guard the paint or to fetch a rebound. Difference makers for championship contenders.Rocklin coach Casey Cutts said a small-college recruiter stopped by his Placer County high school to watch practice earlier this month. Drew Ardissone, the Thunder's 6-foot-1 senior forward, caught the recruiter's eye.""He said Drew was a nuisance player, a compliment because he did the dirty work that not all players like to do,"" Cutts said. ""It takes a certain type of kid to be like that  not afraid to do the blue-collar thing. Multiple kids who buy into that usually have team success.""Ardissone didn't score against Roseville on Tuesday night, but like other grunt players across the region, his value cannot be measured just by scoring average. He drew three charges, including one late, to help key No. 7 Rocklin's 95-83 overtime victory.In south Sacramento, the No. 11 Florin girls are propelled by Daijah Joe-Smith, a 5-8 senior forward who wears opposing teams out. She averages 17.6 points, often on putbacks and loose balls, 13.4 rebounds and 4.3 steals. She exits games appearing as if she just completed a triathlon.""Relentless and nonstop,"" Florin coach Larry Price said of Joe-Smith. ""She's going to get on the floor. She's compiling numbers by scraping, being an Energizer bunny, and she's like a mosquito  you swat, and she comes right back at you.""Even star-studded teams benefit from blue-collar players. While top-ranked Sheldon features stars Dakarai Allen, Darin Johnson, D'Erryl Williams and Ryan Manning  it is the determination of an unsung 6-1 forward that captures the team's spirit. Senior Antonio Lewis leads the team in rebounding with 10 a game, and has twice cleared 20 this season, though he is sometimes the smallest man on the floor. Lewis sports a high-rise hairstyle and is called ""Buck Williams"" by his coaches for his resemblance and results to the NBA rebounding star from the 1980s and '90s.""That's my job  compete and grab boards, and I love it,"" Lewis said. ""It's fun to score, too, but I know my main role. Every team needs a guy like that.""Some teams have a lineup of effort players to combat size.In Greenhaven on Tuesday night, Kennedy senior To'a Kolokihakaufisi, all 6 feet of him, drew charges, hustled for rebounds and slithered past taller, stronger bodies in scoring 13 points in a 69-66 triumph over No. 10 Burbank. Last week, the Cougars upset then-No. 2 Sacramento 66-59 and its lineup of regal talents. No. 19 Kennedy sits atop the Metropolitan Conference standings at 7-0, fueled by fellow sub-6-footers in Cole Taira, Matt Nakatomi, Brandon Burns and Colin Uda.""That's what separates us from other teams  desire,"" Kolokihakaufisi said. ""We're not a big team. We're not intimidating. We don't have any buffed guys. But we know how to compete.""Said Burbank coach Lindsey Ferrell, ""That's a hard team to play; they never quit.""""We have to play hard like this  look at us,"" Kennedy coach Robert Fong said. ""No one is knocking on our door to offer scholarships. What sets us apart is effort, we have a high basketball IQ and we're very unselfish. You can win that way.""In El Dorado Hills, the No. 2 Oak Ridge girls don't dazzle recruiters with a lineup of prospects, but coach Steve White said the Trojans have cohesion and drive, headed by leaders Jenn Hoffman, Ali Bettencourt and Haley Anderson.""Our practices are intense,"" White said. ""That's where it starts. Everyone goes hard to earn minutes, to make a difference. You add up all the effort and you get results."""\u000a

V"A controversial Alaska gun bill sponsored by House Speaker Mike Chenault that would put federal agents at risk of felony charges for enforcing certain future weapons laws cleared the lone committee assigned to hear it Monday, despite a legal opinion saying it is likely unconstitutional.Chenault's proposal is immensely popular among Republicans and a few Democrats. It has 19 co-sponsors, so half the House is already signed onto it.Rep. Chris Tuck, an Anchorage Democrat, is an enthusiastic backer.On Monday, House Bill 69 cleared the House Judiciary Committee with support of six of the seven members. One was Nome Democrat Neal Foster, part of the Republican-controlled majority. His father was tried and acquitted more than 20 years ago of illegally possessing unregistered machine guns.Chenault's bill is among a number of gun measures being heard in legislative committees this session, mainly in the House. Big Lake Republican Rep. Mark Neuman's ""stand your ground"" bill, which expands the right to use deadly force as self-defense, passed the Judiciary Committee earlier this month, as did GOP colleague Charisse Millett's resolution expressing disapproval with President Obama's executive orders regarding gun control and gun safety. Another bill, allowing school districts to arm school employees, is before the House Education Committee.The flurry of Alaska and federal gun measures comes in the aftermath of the December massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.Chenault proposes to dramatically expand a 2010 state law by asserting that any firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition possessed by anyone in Alaska is not subject to federal law. The earlier law only covered weapons and ammunition manufactured here.In addition, Chenault's proposal declares that any ""federal statute, regulation, rule or order"" is invalid in Alaska if it bans or restricts semi-automatic firearms, magazines or accessories. Obama has proposed to ban semi-automatic assault rifles and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Any federal weapons registration system would be unenforceable as well, Chenault's bill says.A federal law enforcement officer who tries to enforce gun registration or a ban on semi-automatic weapons would be subject to state prosecution on felony charges, under an amended version of Chenault's bill. He originally proposed trying to make the point with the threat of misdemeanor charges.In Monday's hearing, the only legislator raising concerns was Max Gruenberg, D-Anchorage. He warned his fellow committee members that the bill was unconstitutional and unenforceable and that Alaskans who relied on it could ""find themselves going to jail for a long time.""""This is actually something that is more than an academic exercise,"" Gruenberg said. ""The feds don't blink at this.""Without mentioning the legislator by name, he brought up the case of the late Rep. Richard Foster, a Nome Democrat who in 1991 was acquitted of possessing six unregistered machine guns, a sawed off shotgun, and a 50mm mortar described by the prosecution as a rocket launcher, according to news reports from the trial. The defense succeeded in moving the case to Nome, where it was heard by a hometown jury in a place where almost every family owns guns.While Foster beat the charges, Gruenberg said he didn't want to subject Alaskans to prosecution on federal gun laws that they thought they didn't have to follow. Chenault is trying to make a point, he said, but it will be costly. The right way to push back is through Congress, he said.Rep. Gabrielle LeDoux, R-Anchorage, disagreed.""Sometimes statements by themselves are important,"" she said. Look at the marijuana liberalization laws various states now have on the books, which contradict federal drug laws, she said. ""Sometimes the feds do blink.""Tuck, the only member of the Democratic minority who has signed on as a co-sponsor, said in an interview that the Legislature needs to step up for Second Amendment gun rights.""We're unique up here. We still live off the land, primarily,"" said Tuck, who owns a couple of rifles and enjoys shooting -- his team placed second in a competition last year --though he isn't a regular hunter himself.For decades, Congress has relied on the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution to regulate guns. Chenault's bill declares that if a gun is possessed in Alaska, the interstate commerce provision does not apply.One of the Legislature's lawyers, Kathleen Strasbaugh, advised Chenault in a memo last month that his bill ""is largely unconstitutional."" When federal and state laws conflict, the federal law is supreme, she noted.Guns can be bought and sold across state lines, so even someone manufacturing homemade machine guns is subject to federal control, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled.Richard Svobodny, deputy attorney general over the criminal division, said a California case dating to the Gold Rush era involving a U.S. marshal established that if a federal agent is charged with a state crime in the line of duty, the case will be moved to federal court.""That's called removal of jurisdiction,"" he said.If the Legislature backs the bill, the courts will decide whether it will hold up, says Chenault, who owns many guns including semi-automatic weapons.He is familiar with pushing the rules.Last week, a reporter asked why the Legislature would consider allowing armed school employees when in the Capitol, only law enforcement officers can carry guns.""There are guns in this Capitol,"" Chenault answered. ""They are probably in almost every building."" He said he knows of a teacher who carries a gun at school.""When people are concerned about their safety, that's the atmosphere that you breed.""House Bill 69 now goes to the Rules Committee."\u000a

V"Vlade Divac and Drazen Petrovic were like brothers as members of the 1988 Olympic silver-medal-winning Yugoslavian men's national basketball team before becoming early-wave European impact players in the NBA.But the tumultuous fracturing of the country and bloody civil wars in the early 1990s drove a wedge between Divac, a Serb, and Petrovic, a Croat.""To build a friendship takes years, but to destroy it, it takes one second,"" said Divac in the documentary ""Once Brothers.""There was no opportunity for reconciliation for Divac after Petrovic's death in a car accident in 1993.But for Del Campo teenagers and basketball standouts Semir Cahtarevic and Vasilije Saraba, the brotherly bond of a Christian and Muslim may serve as a symbolic healing of a cultural wound, even if it's happening thousands of miles from their war-scarred homeland.""Here's a guy from a country that was in war with mine, and he should be like a bad guy to me, but we're friends,"" said Cahtarevic, a Bosnian.Said Saraba, a Serb: ""I feel the same way as him. I'm proud of my country, my heritage, but the great thing about America is the way we come together from so many cultures.""In another twist, Saraba, a 6-foot-4 junior wing, likes to model his game after the slick-shooting Petrovic, while Cahtarevic, a 6-7 senior post and wing, is an admirer of Divac, one of the best passing centers to ever play.""They have fun with the Divac-Petrovic thing,"" Del Campo coach Dave Nobis said. ""They work so well together on the court. They're both extremely coachable, and they're throwbacks in that they don't mind constructive criticism.""Cahtarevic came to the United States at age 3, his family  father Hidajet, mother Zijada and younger brother Emrah (a Del Campo freshman)  driven from Bosnia by the strife.Saraba arrived at age 8, seven years after his father, Lazar, had immigrated to the United States seeking a better opportunity for his wife, Milojka, his youngest child and Vasilije's older brother and sister, Nikola and Lulu.Despite spending most of their lives in the United States, both bring a European-style sensibility to a No. 9 Del Campo team that is 14-5 and hopes to go deep enough into the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II playoffs to reach Sleep Train Arena.Cahtarevic and Saraba have an array of skills. Both can dribble, pass and score, talents honed by returning almost every summer to play in the European towns where they were born.Saraba is averaging a team-high 20.2 points per game and is 41percent (42 for 101) in three-pointers and 88 percent from the foul line (65 of 74).Cahtarevic averages 13 points, 9.2 rebounds, 3.7 assists and often is the team's primary ballhandler, despite being the Cougars' tallest player.Both earned the admiration of longtime Foothill coach Drew Hibbs when they helped the Cougars beat his shorthanded Mustangs 77-31 Jan. 2. The duo accounted for eight of Del Campo's 12 three-pointers.""I was very impressed,"" Hibbs said. ""They obviously work well together. They sure shot it well against us.""If the two players have an Achilles' heel, it's how they react sometimes to physical play. They got a big dose of body bumps against Del Oro on Jan. 4, a nonleague game that saw the Golden Eagles rally from 15 points down in the fourth quarter to win 76-70 in overtime, snapping Del Campo's 10-game winning streak.Still, Nobis said both have come a long way since their freshmen years."" 'V' was about 5-8 and the eighth man on the freshman team, then he went to Europe over the summer and came back at 6-2,"" Nobis said. ""We used him as a zone buster last season.""This summer, he goes back to Serbia again, comes back at 6-4, and now he can shoot it even better and gets to the basket.""Cahtarevic was a little more physically developed as a freshman, but ""it took him awhile to get it,"" Nobis said. He was the only junior starter on last year's 22-6 team, and now he's the only senior starter on a team with nine juniors.""The question mark at the start of this season was if Semir was going to step up and be a leader, and he has,"" Nobis said. ""He's a great passer. He really finds people, especially 'V'.""Cahtarevic hopes to make his mother proud by earning a full-ride college scholarship. A former player, Zijada was his first coach and gets the most credit for his silky shooting stroke.""I'd go to the park when I was little and try to do layups,"" he said. ""She'd keep having me step back and shoot from the free-throw line.""Saraba has even bigger dreams. He hopes to become the second Del Campo player to reach the NBA, joining current Los Angeles Clippers journeyman Matt Barnes.Saraba and Cahtarevic got to play against Barnes in an alumni-varsity game last year and both were quick to note that they beat Barnes' alumni team by a point.But Nobis put things in perspective  Barnes scored 47 points.The 6-8 pro's gritty playing style doesn't have the same allure for Cahtarevic or Saraba as does the style of play of their European heroes, Divac and Petrovic.But they thought it was special to be able to play up close and personal against an NBA player that attended their same Fair Oaks school.""We got to talk to him the night before during an open gym,"" Cahtarevic said. ""That was pretty neat."""\u000a

V"With a year-round commitment to weight training and conditioning, high school linemen continue to beef up.There's no better example than at No. 8 Del Campo.The Cougars have a number of impact linemen who weigh 250 pounds or more.Among them are three-year two-way starter A.J. Samataua (6-foot-3, 315 pounds), Dre Martinez (6-1, 265), JJ Tufu (6-2, 250) and Kyle Evanski (6-2, 250).But senior nose guard Devar Card  a favorite of coach Mike Dimino  has gone in a different direction since his days as a 5-6, 300-plus-pound, low-endurance freshman.Card, nicknamed ""Quake"" by his teammates, has continued to slim down  he's now 275 pounds  while getting taller (he's 5-10), stronger and more mobile.The maturation of Card and his linemates is a big reason Del Campo (7-2, 4-0) is playing at No. 19 Rio Linda (8-1, 4-0) tonight for the Capital Valley Conference championship and will join favored Folsom and Elk Grove in next week's Division II playoff field as an intriguing team.The Cougars rebounded from a 1-2 start, including a heartbreaking 20-16 loss to Elk Grove on a late disputed call, to win their past six games.With so many big, strong and quick linemen, the Cougars have simply beaten up teams running the ball with senior Josh Blumgold and junior Austin Brown. They can pass block, too, which makes quarterback Derek Rodigo a potential difference-maker in the postseason.A win tonight would give Dimino his sixth league championship in his 10-year tenure at the Fair Oaks school. He also has led Del Campo to two D-III Sac-Joaquin Section championships.Dragon looks to play  Although Sac High quarterback Josiah Johnson usually plays just a half because of the Dragons' beatdowns of most Metro Conference foes, he continues to try to help his team.Two weeks ago in a 73-0 win over Valley, Johnson filled in as long snapper for injured Jake Brazier.Johnson also tried to line up with the kickoff team in the third quarter before perturbed coach Paul Doherty, concerned about an injury, yanked him off.""I'll do anything to get on the field,"" said Johnson, who also plays free safety. ""They could have put me at right guard and I would have been down blocking, pulling and doing kickouts. I just want to play.""Johnson, the section total yardage leader with 3,448, will try to help lead Sacramento to its first eight-win season in years against McClatchy on Saturday at 1 p.m. in the Metro Conference curtain closer.Grant in, Del Oro out? - The Bee's Nathaniel Levine offers up a look at the projected playoff field  based on predicted outcomes of this weekend's games  at sacbee.com/preps. Based on predictions from CalPreps.com, Levine has Grant making the D-I playoffs but Del Oro (Rocklin is predicted to win tonight) failing to reach postseason play in D-II.River Valley adds win  Woodland has forfeited its victory over River Valley last week because it used an ineligible player. That moves River Valley to 6-3 and makes the Yuba City school playoff bound no matter how it fares tonight against No. 11 Yuba City.Playoff preview show  The section and PlayOn!

The show, scheduled to start at approximately 4:30 p.m. when the brackets are complete, will be on the section's PlayOn web portal at cifsacjoaquin.tv.

V"Never mind that his legs and arm are shot, Mike Johnson takes the snap and muscles the ball 35 yards down field with a whistle in his mouth and defenders in his grille.Give the 46-year-old Franklin High School football coach a nod for effort. Johnson coaches with passion that includes running drills so every player can see a scheme or tendency.He implores his upstart bunch to follow suit.""I wonder if Vince Lombardi ever ran scout-team quarterback,"" Johnson joked following Monday afternoon's practice.While Johnson's skills have faded, the Wildcats have plenty of talent and motivation. Franklin is 5-0 and ranked No. 2 by The Bee. There is a sense of urgency on the Elk Grove campus that still looks new. Seventeen starters returned from a playoff group. A balanced offense and a swarming defense have the Wildcats, in their 10th varsity season, dreaming big.They want to win the Delta Valley Conference. They want to beat Grant for the first time Friday. They want to topple top-ranked Elk Grove later this month. They want a 10-0 regular season, and to win the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship. Winning a regional playoff berth also would be nice, followed, of course, by a state bowl bid.""We want it all,"" said a grinning Trent Spallas, the Franklin quarterback with a nice arm and who can run. ""We're in the right situation with all the right pieces in place, and it all starts with the coach.""The 6-foot-5 Johnson was a three-sport athlete at Westmont High in Campbell in the mid- 1980s. His father, Dave, coached for 35 years in the Bay Area. His grandfather Al was a coaching fixture in Southern California, so much so that the athletic department at Wilson High in Long Beach bears his name.Johnson's calm demeanor and good nature belies his competitive spirit.He charged after Lincoln of Stockton coaches following a playoff loss last season, furious that the Trojans piled on a late touchdown in a rout.""To see our coach upset like that showed us he really cared, and we already knew he did,"" Franklin senior all-purpose star Tre Lampley said. ""Coach is the leader of this family. He's Pops. Keeps us together, keeps us motivated.""Johnson coached at Lincoln of Stockton when the Trojans won a section championship in 2000. Following that season, he left for Franklin and the challenge of a new school in the expanding Elk Grove Unified School District.""I'm a goal-oriented guy, and this was a great challenge,"" Johnson said.Johnson stepped away from Franklin football for the 2009 season to coach his sons in youth football. He returned in 2010. He still squeezes in weekend youth duty for a program that includes his seventh-grade son Brady. His sophomore son Brandon is on the Franklin junior varsity.""I came back to high school coaching here because I'm a part of this school, an original teacher, and I have a lot of passion for this place,"" Johnson said.Johnson downplays his impact as a coach, however, pointing to assistants and team leaders. He insists the best coach at the dinner table is his wife, Gina. She has led the Delta College women's basketball team to nine conference championships and three state semifinal appearances.""I'd have no problem pulling her to the floor,"" said Johnson, who met his wife while they were students at Cal Poly. ""We used to play on co-ed teams. I rebounded and kicked it out to her to shoot. That made her happy.""Johnson said his wife taught him a coaching ploy this fall of delegating work to captains. Franklin's seven captains  Lampley, Spallas, defensive back Marcus Green, linebacker Joey Banks, running back Christian Fonbuena and linemen Connor Adams and William Vi  each have a group of seven to work with. Johnson meets with his captains every Tuesday to discuss the team. The captains work with their groups to go over everything. How things are in class. Homework concerns. Who sits where on the bus trip.The Wildcats had a bye last Friday, but they remained together for a catered team dinner in the gym followed by skits. Guess which coach was ribbed the most?Johnson is known to squeeze his play chart and rub his stomach during anxious moments.""My group won the skit,"" a proud Spallas said. ""We're having fun while we also work hard on goals. We know we have something special here this year."""\u000a

""I coached at Rio Americano (1974-80), I was athletic director, my grandson is playing, I know these kids, and they need some help.""They also need a fresh start, which Miller offered as the Raiders prepare to play their Capital Athletic League opener Friday at Cordova, the school where Miller attained his greatest renown.Team captain Jordan Vinson said the players are united again.""Everyone's on board, everyone's together, we're stronger than ever,"" said Vinson, one of two seniors who stayed with the team.

V"ISTANBUL  Tony Hayward, the oil executive Americans learned to hate during last year's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, is back in business, this time in the rich oil fields of northern Iraq. At a news conference Thursday in Istanbul, Hayward announced the merger of his Vallares PLC with Turkey's Genel Energy in an effort to dominate exploration of the vast oil reserves of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region. The new company also intends to invest in other areas in the Middle East. The only approval we need is from the Kurdistan regional government, and we expect that approval to take place before the end of September, Hayward said.  All of the indications in Kurdistan show that things are only going to get better. I think this is a good time to invest in the Kurdistan region. Hayward was removed as the CEO of BP in July 2010 in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill after a controversial appearance before a congressional committee that was investigating the causes of the disaster. He later set up Vallares, an investment company that raised $2.1 billion in June in a public offering.  The company formed by Thursday's merger will be called Genel Energy PLC, with headquarters in Ankara, Turkey. Mehmet Sepil, the new company's CEO, said he expected the company to be listed on the London Stock Exchange in about four weeks. Hayward said he was undeterred by debate in Iraq's parliament about a new oil investment law. The debate around the hydrocarbon law will continue, and none of us know when it will be resolved, he said. But we do know that whatever is the resolve, the Kurdistan region will have a significant say in what is finally approved. Iraq halted oil exports from the Kurdish region for a year over a dispute between Kurdish authorities and the central government in Iraq about distribution of revenues, but it resumed them earlier this year. Hayward said he and Sepil would travel to Irbil in northern Iraq to meet with authorities there after the announcement in Istanbul. (Yezdani is a McClatchy special correspondent.)

V"Theresa Rebeck's 2011 play ""Seminar"" has several strong elements going for its West Coast premiere at the B Street Theatre. Beginning as a funny, biting satire of various East Coast literary tropes and types, the play effectively turns itself inside out to become an earnest, satisfying redemption drama. The turn is accomplished through a clever bit of writing and a powerful performance from Kurt Johnson. Johnson plays Leonard, a burned-out legendary editor and former novelist-of-the-moment, now teaching an exclusive writing seminar to young aspiring writers. Leonard's withering critiques make tough love seem warm and fuzzy by comparison, leaving his students wondering why they've paid $5,000 to be brutally insulted and casually dismissed. Leonard's observations, as uncomfortable (and cringingly funny) as they are, come with warnings that truth is about to be dispensed  do you want to hear it? He's not being mean just to be mean. From his viewpoint, he's offering a kind of verbal shock therapy to his inoculated students and they, for the most part, take the licking and keep on ticking.The writing group meets at the Upper West Side apartment of Stephanie Altholz's Kate, who takes the first beat-down after offering up a story she's been working on for six years.Throughout ""Seminar,"" Rebeck pokes fun at the pretensions of liberal arts colleges (Kate's attendance at Bennington is a running joke), writers' retreats and even the type of fiction published in the New Yorker  Leonard calls it ""the detached tone of perplexed intelligence.""Dan Fagan's Douglas is ""not without talent,"" though Leonard tells him he'd be better off in Hollywood; Tara Sissom's pragmatic Izzy has a sexual spark in her work and personality, which catches Leonard's eye as well. Joseph O'Malley's dour Martin is the group's sulking cipher, not offering his own work while berating Leonard's methods and questionable socializing. The play takes a schematic form of the classes' weekly meetings, as Rebeck pulls from her experience as a television writer on such shows as ""Law and Order"" and ""NYPD Blue."" Her sure-footed plot sticks plenty of romantic intrigues among the participants to go with the writing seminar's lessons.Scenic designer Catherine Frye creates a sleek, open apartment for the class, and director Busfield lets the acerbic comedy flow over an audience that might not be quite sure what is coming. Rebeck loves language and writing, and ""Seminar"" acts as a muddled valentine to those who try to write. The dissipation of fiction as an art form and the business of writing push Leonard to say, ""It's not the writing that's the problem, it's everything else.""Though we see an obvious character at first in Johnson's Leonard, what Rebeck has packed underneath makes him worth watching.SEMINAR Three 1/2 StarsWhat: B Street Theatre presents the West Coast premiere of Theresa Rebeck's comedy drama about four young writers taking a class from a legendary older novelist.When: 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays; 2 and 6:30 p.m. Wednesdays; 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays; 5 and 9 p.m. Saturdays; 2 p.m. Sundays through Sept. 23.

V"Eddie Vanderdoes said he went with his instincts, heart and gut.

A 6-foot-4, 301-pound senior defensive end-tackle, Vanderdoes is a 5-star recruit who has scholarship offers from programs such as Alabama, LSU, Arkansas, Florida, Penn State, Michigan and throughout the Pacific-12 Conference.The Sac-Joaquin Section's top recruit, Vanderdoes is known for his burst off the line of scrimmage, athleticism and strong academics.""He's the total package, a humble guy who our younger guys can look up to,"" Placer coach Joey Montoya said. ""If I ever get a guy even close to a kid like Eddie the rest of my career, I'd be very lucky. Really special.""Although Vanderdoes can change his mind before February's national signing date, he is relieved to have made the decision.""I feel great about this. Great coaches at USC, great people,"" he said. ""Can't beat the academics, the football tradition, the weather. It's a life decision. It's not just a four-year decision. It's huge, crucial, and it's great. USC is setting me up for the rest of my career and life.""Vanderdoes said he can exhale from the recruiting madness that includes calls, mail and campus visits. Schools still can actively recruit Vanderdoes, but he said he has been sure of his USC commitment for nearly a month. He said he also is relieved for his parents, Eddie and Behia.""Oh yes, it's really nice to have this done,"" Vanderdoes said. ""I can sleep at night again, and that's a plus. I know it's not officially over until I sign, but it's USC for me. It's done. I've got a big monkey off my back.""Now I can just concentrate on school and football and not have to come home at 9 at night and return a lot of coaches' calls.""USC previously has landed Sacramento-area football talent. Artimus ""T"" Parker of Sacramento High was an All-America safety for the 1972 national championship team that still is considered one of the greatest teams in Trojans history.More recently, Armond Armstead of Pleasant Grove excelled on the Trojans' defensive line and now plays in the Canadian Football League."\u000a

V"After Loeta Odle died in May, Jenae Leles discovered a fourth-grade prophecy that she had made to her beloved grandmother.""She was my best friend growing up. I spent almost every weekend with her,"" said Leles, 25. ""So when we were going through her things, we found a diary that I had given her. I had written that when I grow up, I'm going to play for the USA Women's National Team, travel to Canada and play in the Olympics.""Two of the three predictions have come true for the Fair Oaks resident. Leles is a member of Team USA that begins play in the International Softball Federation World Championship today in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada.Leles, however, will not play in the Summer Olympics in London.Softball was voted out of the Olympics in 2005, mainly because of the USA's longtime dominance of the sport. The decision came three years before the USA lost to Japan for Olympic gold in Beijing, snapping a 22-game USA Olympic winning streak dating back eight years.The 2008 Games also were held one year before the former Rio Americano High School star and Arizona slugger  she played on two NCAA championship teams and hit 57 career home runs  made the first of three USA national teams.""It's disappointing how things have worked out as far as the Olympics,"" Leles said. ""But we still have the World Championships and other international competitions like the World Cup and the Pan American Games.""So there's still plenty to be thankful for. Nothing compares to wearing the red, white and blue and being able to represent your country.""In her Team USA tenure, Leles has played across the globe. But never has she played in a major championship in a place quite like Whitehorse, a town of 25,000 located in Canada's remote northwest Yukon territory.It's called the ""Wilderness City"" for a reason. The days are long (20 hours of daylight) and the July temperatures, at least by Leles' standards, are frigid (highs in the mid-60s).""I hate cold weather,"" Leles said. ""I run best on solar power.""The World Championship, which concludes July 22, is the last leg on what has been a marathon seven-week tour that included stops in West Virginia, Ohio, Oklahoma City and Surrey, British Columbia.Team USA won 14 games against international competition but not its most recent. Japan beat the Americans 9-6 Monday in an eight-inning international tiebreaker in the Canadian Open FastPitch Championship.""When you play Japan, you expect excellence, and you've got to be mentally ready,"" Leles said. ""If there was any consolation, it's that it happened before the World Championships. I think we've learned from that loss.""Leles, once a wide-eyed rookie facing the offerings of high-profile pitching stars Jennie Finch and Cat Osterman, is now one of the oldest players on a team comprised mainly of collegians or recent graduates.""My first year, I was pretty much a mute,"" Leles said. ""But now I'm comfortable with the coaches and asking questions and speaking my mind.""But her team-first attitude hasn't changed. She has started games and watched others from the bench, including the loss to Japan. Mostly a third baseman, she also has played first base, outfield and been a designated hitter.""We have 17 of the best girls in the country, perhaps the world, so we can have 10 different lineups and still be the best team,"" Leles said. ""I think that's what helps in our success. There are no selfish personalities on this team.""After playing for Team USA in 2009, Leles didn't make Team USA the next season, playing instead on the second-tier Futures Team. That steeled her resolve.""I love to compete,"" Leles said. ""I just wanted it even more and went after it even harder.""Team USA coach Ken Eriksen saw Leles' determination.""You could tell that not only did she get better between the lines, but she got better outside the lines,"" Eriksen told the Norman (Okla.) Transcript earlier this month. "" I remember her coming up to me at the end of that one year saying, 'I'm coming back. I'm going to work by butt off.'  You find out who has the heart to wear the USA and who doesn't. She has the heart.""With the next World Championship scheduled for the Netherlands in 2014 and with the possibility of softball being reinstated for the 2020 Olympics, Leles has no thoughts of retirement.""I'm going to play as long as I can,"" said Leles, who aspires to become a college softball coach. ""And when I'm done, I expect I'll be involved in the sport in some way because I can talk softball all day.""My college coach (Mike Candrea) told me that you need a career where you wake up every day and can't wait to go to work.

V"The plans envision new homes, a school and a water treatment plant for a growing population, new buildings to house its government and sites to honor its history and culture. But the Yoche Dehe Wintun Nation's application to take more than 850 acres near its signature Cache Creek Casino Resort into federal trust has troubled its Capay Valley neighbors and Yolo County leaders. They are demanding a closer look at the tribe's request.The tribe owns the land's 15 parcels, scattered orchards and grasslands along Highway 16 but would relinquish the property to the federal government if the trust application is approved. In a federal trust, the government holds legal title to the property, but the tribe is the beneficiary. Such an arrangement would give the tribe more freedom to determine land use.But Yolo leaders say the acreage is far too large - they want the tribe to agree to 100 acres. They have questions about what might be built on the land and suggest its effects on the Capay Valley could be too great. Yolo supervisors challenge federal jurisdiction over the property. They say it would take away the county's ability to plan for how the land will be used in the future, limit their ability to protect its agricultural designation and strip neighbors' ability to plan for any future impacts of tribal development. ""We can't identify a reasonable purpose for that transfer.  We think there's a legitimate purpose in transferring the property, just not all of it,"" said county Supervisor Don Saylor. ""We have to wonder what future use might be anticipated.""The Yocha Dehe insist their plans for the land extend to housing and community buildings and agriculture.Yocha Dehe leaders were not available for comment, but in a statement, spokesman Greg Larsen told The Bee that the tribe had hoped for the county's support.""Yocha Dehe had nearly two years of good-faith discussions on these issues with county staff and believed we were close to a successful agreement on the key terms,"" Larsen said. He said supervisors backed away from an agreement.Both sides agree that the Yocha Dehe have had a long, collaborative and lucrative relationship with Yolo County. The tribe is the county's largest private sector employer; its economic and philanthropic impact on Yolo County is in the tens of millions of dollars. It has also launched forays into olive oil production and winemaking. Thaddeaus Barsotti, an owner of Capay Organic in Brooks, said the Yocha Dehe have been able to keep a focus on agricultural ventures and maintain the rural character of the community. ""The casino's not going anywhere, but I think they've done a good job of mitigating that where possible,"" Barsotti said.But two years of talks over the land proposal threaten to fray that bond between county and tribe. Yolo County leaders are skeptical and  after a Bureau of Indian Affairs finding in October that the tribal land plan would have no significant environmental impact on the area  angry.Saylor was quick to laud the Yocha Dehe's ""amazing contributions"" to Yolo County and the tribe's collaboration with the county over the years, but said the land request ""is a blow to that collaboration."" The Board of Supervisors aired its concerns in a strongly worded letter Jan. 25 to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. ""The county's concern about the Tribe changing its plans in the future is not speculative,"" the county's letter read, adding that agricultural land that is part of the proposal could also be converted to other uses. ""Given the other paths available to the tribe  the county is deeply concerned that in the future these existing agricultural parcels may be converted to some other use.""Bureau of Indian Affairs officials say the environmental assessment is just a preliminary step.""This is a very early stage of this process. This is not a final decision for the agency,"" said Kevin Bearquiver, the bureau's deputy regional director in Sacramento.Still, the bureau's finding troubles Tom Frederick and Pamela Welch, owners of Capay Valley Vineyards in Brooks. From their front porch and the slopes that produce their viognier, syrah and cabernet sauvignon, they can look out to the Capay Valley's hills and to the Cache Creek Casino Resort next door.Over the years, the couple and the Capay Valley Coalition  a group that seeks to protect agricultural interests in the valley  have kept a wary watch on tribal development.""Our land abuts the current casino property,"" Welch said. ""We've had issues in the past. We know what it means to be near trust land. The biggest concern is the lack of accountability. They can change the land use at a whim. No matter what they have in mind, they cannot speak for future generations."""\u000a

V"It wasn't the result the Kennedy girls wanted Saturday against perennial state power Berkeley.Despite 19 points and 11 rebounds by gifted junior Lynette Johnson, the No. 3 Cougars (26-9) fell 56-38 to the top-seeded Yellowjackets (29-2) in the CIF Northern California Regional Division I girls basketball championship game at Power Balance Pavilion.Still, it was quite a run for a group of girls who thought this was a rebuilding year at the start of the season; tied for second with Florin in their own Metro Conference (to Sacramento High); then won close battle after close battle in the playoffs, including a double-overtime win against Oak Ridge for the Sac-Joaquin D-I Section championship.They did it for a school working to rebuild its athletic reputation in a cash-strapped school district where sports are always on the chopping block, as they are again this year.In the fall, the Greenhaven school was the subject of some unwanted attention after a brawl with league rival McClatchy that led the removal of eight Kennedy football players (and one from McClatchy) from the team. Coach Henry Lusk resigned less than a week later after the discovery of an inappropriate photo posted on Twitter.""I think we have represented the school very well,"" said Kennedy girls coach Dave Parsh. ""Sports is so incredibly important to this school, and we just had a resurrection of our school spirit, not just the girls on the team, but the entire school. It's really been fun to see.""The 5-foot-10 Johnson is a top college prospect who plays offseason Amateur Athletic Union basketball against some of the nation's best players.But she says it doesn't replicate what one experiences being part of a high school team, so she would hate to think what Kennedy would be like without a basketball program.""You are with your teammates every day, so you get a chance to grow, to become like sisters,"" Johnson said. ""You don't get that playing AAU.""This past month has been crazy. We played every single game with heart.  It was like March Madness.""Added senior point guard Lori Wong, an exceptional student who doesn't plan to play basketball in college: ""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and something we'll never forget.""The Cougars had hoped for one more memory, a chance to play Saturday in the state final at Power Balance Pavilion, but Berkeley was too tall and too quick in winning its 11th NorCal title.Arizona State-bound point guard Elisha Davis hit four long-distance three-pointers en route to 32-16 halftime lead. Kennedy got no closer than 10 points in the second half.Davis finished with 17 points, Rachel Howard added 13 points and 12 rebounds, and Desire Finnie had 13 points and nine rebounds.""She hit shots from the NBA line,"" Wong said of Davis. ""She's a really good player.  Coach told us they'd be a lot like Sac High  fast  and it was true.""The loquacious Johnson will return next season as Kennedy's centerpiece, along with a eight other juniors and sophomores.""This was fun,"" Parsh said.

V"President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney seemed determined not to discuss climate change in this campaign. So thanks to Hurricane Sandy for forcing the issue: Isn't it time to talk not only about weather, but also about climate? It's true, of course, that no single storm or drought can be attributed to climate change. Atlantic hurricanes in the Northeast go way back, as the catastrophic ""snow hurricane"" of 1804 attests. But many scientists believe that rising carbon emissions could make extreme weather  like Sandy  more likely. ""You can't say any one single event is reflective of climate change,"" William Solecki, the co-chairman of the New York City Panel on Climate Change, told me. ""But it's illustrative of the conditions and events and scenarios that we expect with climate change."" In that sense, whatever its causes, Sandy offers a window into the way ahead. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York says he told President Obama the other day that it seems ""we have a 100-year flood every two years now."" Indeed, the Times has reported that three of the 10 biggest floods in Lower Manhattan since 1900 have occurred in the last three years. So brace yourself, for several reasons:  Hurricanes form when the ocean is warm, and that warmth is their fuel. The Atlantic waters off the East Coast set a record high temperature this summer. Presumably most of that is natural variation, and some is human-induced climate change.  Computer models suggest that hurricanes won't necessarily become more frequent, but they may become stronger. As the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a collaboration of federal agencies, puts it, ""The intensity of these storms is likely to increase in this century.""  Climate change adds moisture to the atmosphere, which may mean that storms come with more rain and more flooding.  Sandy was particularly destructive because it was prevented from moving back out to sea by a ""blocking pattern"" associated with the jet stream. There's debate about this, but one recent study suggested that melting sea ice in the Arctic may lead to such blocking.  Rising seas create a higher baseline for future storm surges. The New York City Panel on Climate Change has projected that coastal waters may rise by 2 feet by 2050 and 4 feet by the end of the century. I was schooled in the far-reaching changes under way several years ago by Eskimos in Alaska, who told me of their amazement at seeing changes in their Arctic village  from melting permafrost to robins (for which their Inupiat language has no word). If we can't see that something extraordinary is going on in the world around us, we're in trouble. ""Of the 10 warmest summers on record for the contiguous U.S., seven have occurred since 2000,"" notes Jake Crouch of the National Climatic Data Center. They include this summer's drought in the United States, the worst in more than half a century. ""For the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change,"" James E. Hansen, a NASA climate scientist, recently wrote in the Washington Post. Politicians have dropped the ball, but so have those of us in the news business. The number of articles about climate change fell by 41 percent from 2009 to 2011, according to DailyClimate.org. There are no easy solutions, but we may need to invest in cleaner energy, impose a carbon tax or other curbs on greenhouse gases, and, above all, rethink how we can reduce the toll of a changing climate. For example, we may not want to rebuild in some coastal areas that have been hammered by Sandy. We'll also need a stronger FEMA  which makes Romney's past suggestions that FEMA be privatized particularly myopic. That's almost as bizarre as Michael Brown, the FEMA director during Hurricane Katrina, scolding Obama for responding to Sandy ""so quickly.""Democrats have been AWOL on climate change, but Republicans have been even more recalcitrant. Their failure is odd, because in other areas of national security Republicans pride themselves on their vigilance. Romney doesn't want to wait until he sees an Iranian nuclear weapon before acting, so why the passivity about climate change? Along with 8 million others, the Kristofs have lost power, so I've been sending Twitter messages on my iPhone by candlelight  an odd juxtaposition that feels like a wake-up call. In the candlelit aftermath of a future hurricane, I'm guessing, we'll look back at the silence about climate in the 2012 election and ask: ""What were they thinking?"""\u000a

V"President Obama told the National Governors Association -- meeting today at the White House -- that members should lobby their members of Congress to avoid the looming series of spending cuts known as the sequester.Congress could put an end to the cuts, Obama said, with a little bit of compromise. He wants Republicans -- who are opposed to raising tax revenue -- to accept a mix of spending cuts and tax revenue.""While you are in town, I hope that you speak with your congressional delegation and remind them in no uncertain terms exactly what is at stake and exactly who is at risk,"" Obama told the governors. ""These cuts do not have to happen. Congress can turn them off anytime with just a little bit of compromise.""He noted that compromise would mean Democrats need to ""acknowledge that we're gonna have to make modest reforms in Medicare if we want the program there for future generations and if we hope to maintain our ability to invest in critical things like education, research and infrastructure.""But, he added, ""We also need Republicans to adopt the same approach to tax reform that Speaker Boehner championed just two months ago.""He accused Republicans of instead putting their reelection interests ahead of everything else:""This town has to get past its obsession with focusing on the next election rather than the next generation,"" Obama told the governors.

He remains the only American to win an Olympic gold medal at that distance.Rinde, a former Casa Roble High School and Sacramento State standout, set the gold standard for local marathoners with a 2-hour, 14-minute, 13-second effort in the 1984 California International Marathon. He also finished seventh in the 1981 Boston Marathon in 2:12:01, the fastest time ever recorded by a Sacramento-area runner.Claugus, who starred at Rio Americano, set the national record for the high school mile by running 4:40.2 and ran a personal best in the marathon with a 2:37:16 performance in the 1982 Chicago Marathon.Somers, who ran for UC Davis, won the 1993 CIM and the U.S. national women's marathon title with a 2:34:11 performance. Clark was inducted into the American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame in 2011. He won the U.S. 100K Championship in 1988 with a sub-7-hour performance. Klein shattered the world marks for women 80 and older (4:31:32) and 85 and older (5:49:11). Reese was a pioneer in the ultrarunning community.The Hall of Fame dinner starts at 6 p.m., and tickets are $50.

He is the first sophomore to be named a Bee Player of the Year.Zach Claiborne of Oak Ridge is The Bee's Defensive Player of the Year because of his ability to shed blocks and zero in on quarterbacks at a record rate. The senior had a state-leading and all-time area-best 251/2 sacks.Monroe rushed for 1,545 yards and 17 touchdowns despite missing three games because of a knee strain. He is a powerful 6-foot-1, 190-pounder who has what Del Oro coach Casey Taylor says is ""the best vision and lateral cuts I've seen.""Monroe was unstoppable down the stretch, running for 192 yards and scoring three touchdowns in a 45-35 victory over Nevada Union and 193 yards and three touchdowns in a 38-35 victory over Rocklin in a Sierra Foothill League finale that secured a Sac-Joaquin Section Division II playoff berth. In a playoff opener against Yuba City, Monroe went for 225 yards and four scores in a 45-21 win. Then he gained 297 yards and scored three times in a 21-10 victory over St. Mary's of Stockton. He had 206 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-32 loss to Elk Grove in the semifinals that ended Del Oro's season.Monroe also had three interceptions and scored twice on special teams.Monroe, who initially didn't like the kind of contact football produced and now can't seem to get enough, will play for the North team Saturday in the 56th Optimist All-Star Football Classic at Del Oro.""I didn't like getting hit when I first played,"" said Monroe, who has made a verbal commitment to San Jose State. ""I got whacked on one play, then after awhile I started to like the game.""Browning won the Folsom quarterback job on the eve of the season, then torched Woodcreek in the team's opener for a national-record-tying 10 touchdown passes and a Northern California record 699 passing yards. Browning is on his way to ""becoming one of this area's all-time great, great players,"" Folsom co-coach Troy Taylor said. ""He's that special.""Browning shrugs, insisting he's just trying to do his job.It was a job well done as he set the state season passing mark with 5,248 yards to go with a Northern California record 63 touchdowns, two shy of the state season record.Folsom finished 14-1, beating Elk Grove for the Division II section title before falling to eventual national No. 1 De La Salle of Concord in the first Northern California Regional Open game.""I didn't think I'd put up those kinds of numbers,"" the 6-2, 180-pound Browning said. ""I really just wanted to help our team win.""While Browning and Monroe grew up playing football, Oak Ridge's Claiborne was a late bloomer. He didn't slip on a helmet until his freshman season, at the plea of friends.By last season, the defensive end had found his groove, with 11 1/2 sacks. This season, Claiborne was even better, using skills from wrestling and martial arts and what his coach Eric Cavaliere called ""a relentless motor"" to chase down quarterbacks.Claiborne caps his career Saturday in the Optimist All-Star Classic, playing for the North. And like every game this season, he'll dedicate it to his grandfather, John Salsedo, who died of cancer during the playoffs.""He's the main reason I started to play this game,"" Claiborne said. ""I think he was proud of what I did."""\u000a

V"Inderkum High School coach Terry Stark thought he was going to have one of the best backfields in the Sac-Joaquin Section this season with tough and speedy D.J. Myart, Josh Montes and Eric Walters  all returning after stellar 2011 seasons.The trio compiled 2,623 rushing yards and 25 touchdowns as juniors, operating from Stark's always-potent wing-T.""Our backfield was loaded,"" Stark said. ""They were all lightning fast.""But Myart was lost to a knee injury just before the start of the season; and then Montes went down with a torn tendon in his left foot a few weeks later.Though Montes, a 1,000-yard rusher last season, recently returned and has had some good games, he still isn't 100 percent.With Myart and Montes sidelined, Walters became the workhorse for several weeks, including a 266-yard, two-touchdown performance in a 34-28 win over Terra Nova of Pacifica on Sept. 28.But he, too, was slowed by a foot injury against Woodland on Oct. 12, then last week was removed from the team by Stark for violating team rules.Stark was forced to promote sophomore Austin Thurmond from the junior varsity to bolster Montes and junior Terence White.The injury carousel has allowed junior quarterback C.J. Spencer to showcase his passing skills (1,400 yards, 11 touchdowns) more than anticipated. Through adversity, the Tigers have grown closer despite watching their 27-game Tri-County Conference winning streak end with a 49-42 loss to Yuba City in the Oct. 5 opener, and later the end of their five-year reign as league champions.Despite the travails, No. 6-seeded Inderkum (8-2) finds itself in a pretty good position for the Sac-Joaquin Section playoffs as it prepares to host No. 11 Manteca (6-4) on Friday.Because of a change in enrollment, the Tigers are no longer in a loaded Division II, where they lost last season in the second round to Folsom.Inderkum is in Division III, which is wide open now that two-time defending section champion Del Oro is in D-II and highly touted Placer is in D-IV.While Oakdale remains the favorite to play in a third consecutive D-III section title game, there is no other clear favorite to reach the final in the 16-team field.Inderkum, on the opposite side of the bracket to top-seeded Oakdale, is making its seventh consecutive playoff appearance.The Tigers have reached the D-III final twice before, falling 27-21 in overtime to Casa Roble in 2008 and 16-12 to Del Campo in 2009, a rain-drenched game that had to be halted temporarily because of a lightning storm.Dragons feel at home  With its 58-21 Bell Game win over McClatchy last week, Sac High earned what coach Paul Doherty says will be the school's first on-campus home playoff football game.The seventh-seeded Dragons (8-2) will play at 1 p.m. Saturday against No. 10 El Camino (7-3) in a D-III opener.This also is the resurgent Dragons' fifth playoff appearance in the past six seasons, but they are still looking for their first section playoff win, despite a relatively rich football history dating back decades (section playoffs didn't start until 1971).The Dragons lost in 2007 and 2009 in the first round at Granite Bay. They also lost road playoff openers to Casa Roble in 2010 and Del Oro in 2011, both in D-III.Sac High, which opened in 1856 and has been at its current Oak Park location since 1924, used to call Hughes Stadium home before moving games to its campus several years ago to build school spirit and to save money."\u000a

And if Wednesday night offered even a glimpse of that hope, the Eagles should expect a long postseason run.With ballhandlers, shooters, runners and rebounders, the third-ranked Eagles beat host Franklin 68-45 in a nonleague contest.Guards Malik Thames and Matt Hayes lead one of the Sac-Joaquin Section's top backcourts, and fellow three-year varsity senior Cole Nord-quist is among the region's top shooters.Thames had 22 points on an array of twisting drives, runners and jumpers. He also played hawking defense for the Eagles (11-3), whose only local loss was to Sacramento.The 6-foot Hayes scored 15, and the 6-3 Nordquist had 11.""That's what we're hoping  cash in on this experience,"" said DePonte, whose team went 24-7 last season in finishing a competitive third in the Delta River League behind Sheldon and Jesuit, teams that met in the section Division I and Northern California large-school finals. ""Our big three of Hayes, Nordquist and Thames has a lot of experience. If the guys around them can step up  .""The sky's the limit.Marquese Chriss, a 6-6 junior post, dunked off the opening tip and had 10 points as he continues to settle into a starting role for Pleasant Grove. He's joined by fellow 6-6 post Thomas Fitzgerald.Eagles senior forward Matt Smrekar was a contributor last season who has emerged as a reliable starter this winter. He had four points, but his primary role is to grab rebounds, clog the lane and issue screeching-halt screens.Thames' brother is San Diego State starting guard Xavier Thames, a former Pleasant Grove star. They talk to each other daily, often about leadership.""We've got a group of guys this year, and we know we can be pretty good,"" Malik Thames said. ""A lot of people look at (Bee No. 1) Sheldon as the (Delta River League) champs, and we have a chip on our shoulder. If we win league, we wouldn't be surprised. We can be pretty good.""Thames said he's grown as a player and young man since his sophomore season, when he was learning on the fly.""I've become a better leader, and I know I have to get my teammates involved, and I have to set an example on how I play pressure defense, get steals,"" Thames said. ""We all have to do this together.""Meanwhile, four-time defending Delta Valley Conference champion Franklin (6-8) has as young a team as seventh-year coach Jesse Formaker has fielded. Typical of the Wildcats, they competed even though outmatched Wednesday. Benson Osayande, a 6-6 junior, had 12 points, and John Moscoso, a 5-9 junior guard, had nine."\u000a

V"Chris Nixon has been labeled a creative offensive guru by his coaching peers for years.He gleefully called plays for Elk Grove High School as the offensive coordinator for the storied Thundering Herd championship teams of the late 1990s and early 2000s, stretching defenses and then buckling them with myriad skill players, trap plays and downfield passing routes.These days, as Elk Grove's head coach, Nixon has simplified things a bit. He goes primarily with two backs, unleashing them on all comers in proving that simplicity works just fine, too.Robert Frazier and Wadus Parker were sensational again on Friday night, combining for five highlight touchdowns against a formidable defense in a 35-14 win over Del Campo in a Sac-Joaquin Section Division II quarterfinal.The weather was relatively dry at Elk Grove/Laguna Creek Stadium, but the Herd backs poured it on in every facet.Frazier, a diminutive 5-foot-7 senior, rushed for 224 yards and scored on runs of 15 and 57 yards, crashing inside, bouncing off tackle or outracing everyone to the corner and down the sideline. Parker, a 5-9 power back with speed, caught a short pass from Tommy Arnold and broke free for an 82-yard score late in the half to give his team the lead for good at 14-7. He capped Elk Grove's first drive of the third quarter with a seven-yard touchdown run, and for good measure, he broke Del Campo's spirit with a 63-yard punt return for a touchdown to make it 28-7. Parker rushed for 90 yards and teamed with Frazier for some big moments on defense with defensive end Bwon Canada.The Herd (11-1) held the Cougars (9-3) to one offensive touchdown.Isaac Cisneros scored on a 15-yard interception return for a 7-0 Del Campo lead in the first. Josh Blumgold rushed for 123 yards for Del Campo, and Austin Brown powered in for a two-yard score for the Cougars.""I put Wadus and Robert out there for everything  runs, punt returns, defense,"" Nixon said. ""I've got to give them a break because I don't know what I would do if I ran 40 yards. I'd need a breather. They take turns wearing down a defense. (They're) nice to have. Great players.""And a great line that faced its biggest and most physical front. The Herd line as a group goes by ""Hammerheads,"" and it is coached by Moe Loller, a former Sacramento State lineman whose unit went by the same nickname. The line consists of Jaime Cruz, Matt Loller, Noah McMahon, Christian Vargas and Dior Vela.Everyone in Herd colors gets into the blocking theme, too. Running back Elijah Jones sprung Parker on his 82-yard scoring reception down the Herd sideline.""We all got involved,"" Parker said with a shy grin. ""It's all of us.

Speaking of super backs, Del Oro has one in Brandon Monroe, who showcased his ability in a scrimmage on the eve of the season, an outing in which Frazier sat out.""They're really good, and they're enormous up front, and Monroe runs behind them,"" Nixon said of Del Oro.

V"B Street Theatre stalwart and associate producer Jerry Montoya along with his 11-year-old son, Malachi, have taken something of a ""Wicked"" route with their new adaptation of ""Hansel and Gretel"" for the B Street Family Series.The Montoyas start with a witch who doesn't want to be a witch (the hugely entertaining Rick Kleber), add an unhappy goblin (the wonderfully eccentric Amy Kelly) and use these two for the back story. Despite daily, pitiful letters, the Witches Council will not release Kleber's desperate witch from her duties. Similarly, Kelly's goblin has no recourse. So they find a spell that will help them. But they need a couple of children for the spell, which leads to the humble homestead of Hansel and Gretel as played by the reliable pair Brandon McCall and Brittni Barger.Even though Kleber and Kelly cast a spell on the lonely father (Dave Pierini), they can't fatten up the children enough to make the recipe work.John Lamb works as an effective puppet master here, deftly handling both the smart family dog and equally clever witch's cat.Noah Agruss has written smart, catchy original music for the show, and the operatically trained Kleber in particular has a great time with the songs.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/05/01/4454309/rx-at-b-street-theatre-good-fun.html,"Playwright Kate Fodor's sharp-witted, laugh-out-loud new comedy ""Rx"" poses a familiar vexing paradox for its main characters.What if professional success means personal failure? Which is more important  love life or work life? The answer might seem easy, but if the outcomes are in opposition with risk and uncertainty in each, then a real choice must be made. That's a lot of heft for a production as enjoyable and entertaining as this new B Street production often is in the new play's West Coast premiere. Fodor cleverly fixes the situation in a clinical drug trial, which also allows her to put several modern ironies into play. The main characters in the midst of mayhem are Stephanie Altholz's Meena and Peter Story's Phil. Meena hates her job but Phil finds his tolerably interesting at the moment. She's the managing editor of American Cattle and Swine magazine and he's a doctor running lab tests for a new drug that treats ""workplace depression."" Meena was a prose poet whose one published book was panned in the only review it received, while Phil was an emergency room doctor whose candor with patients got him fired. Young B Street regulars Altholz and Story form a convincing pair of opposites attracted to each other. Her Meena has an angular rigidity while Story has a soft, pliable facade that openly accepts her. Altholz's subtly expressive body language continually conveys the story of her character's bound-up life while Story emotionally connects with his malleable, cherubic features.Meena's so unhappy that she often leaves work to cry in the back of a nearby department store. So she applies to be a part of the testing process for Phil's SP-925 and gets accepted. The story flits by in a succession of short scenes at the different workplaces with a heady variety of outrageous colleagues. Jason Kuykendall's slick, smug Simon heads up the marketing side of Meena's magazine while Melinda Parrett, goal-oriented team leader of Phil's project, keeps him continually on task.Kuykendall and Parrett are models of bright comic economy with their sharp timing, and one only wishes the characters had scenes with each other. Kurt Johnson nearly steals the show with a couple of hysterical cameos, the first a brilliant marketing-concept duet with Parrett becomes its own contained, dynamic mini-drama. Johnson's second character, a blithely absent-minded research colleague of Phil's, probably should not be allowed near aspirin much less the serious drugs he handles daily.Veteran actress Tamara Walters gives a charming and subtle performance as a woman who befriends Meena in the department store.Director Buck Busfield moves the story crisply, though the short scenes and continual breaks threaten the momentum in the show's second act. Fodor layers a great deal of thought into this zinging comedy, and though she gives her characters more of a break at the end than they need, all are on their game.Rxthree 1/2What: B Street Theatre stages the West Coast premiere of Kate Fodor's comedy romance ""Rx,"" which asks the question ""Can you find love in a clinical drug trial?""

V"Beyond the teeming produce aisles and savory baked goods, past the hubcaps and cutlery and Persian rugs, out of earshot of the migraine-inducing bass bleating from the car stereo tents, way, way, way in the back of sprawling Denio's Farmer's Market and Swap Meet in Roseville comes the sound of a man doing his darndest to hawk a case of Depends Adult Undergarments.""Do I hear $10? Ten, ten, ten. How about $7.50, $7.50? You tell me: $5? Five, five, five. Who wants to get it started? Anyone? Five bucks.""The voice is an urgent staccato, 78-rpms in a 33.3 world, the kind of delivery you hear on end-of-car-commerical disclaimers. This is the hard sell. This is commerce at its most elemental. Just raise your numbered card to tell the helicopter-armed man in the 10-gallon (do I hear 8?) cowboy hat what you're willing to bid, then wait out the others. ""Five, five, five  ""Still no takers on the Depends. But unfazed Larry Folkerts, bonded auctioneer, barely blinks or inhales before he's off again. ""OK, we'll pass. Next item ""Twenty-one years after the last gavel sounded, Denio's has recently returned to the auction business. Twice a month through 2012, it will team with Folkerts' TGW Auctions to hawk wares great and small. Those with memories of the FDR administration will recall that Denio's once auctioned off livestock. No sheep now, but can they interest you in an Australian wool comforter?""We figured this was a good time to come back,"" said Eric Denio, marketing manager. ""You would not believe the number of people who wanted to see it.""Oh yes we would, judging by the stream of Saturday shoppers, locals and Bay Area interlopers, picking over items like vultures over carrion. Who knew such a trove of discounted goods could be had in Roseville?From the bottom end (adult diapers) to the top notch (Pioneer 42-inch HD plasma TV) and everything in between (chain saws, golf clubs, paper towel dispensers, leaf blowers and hip-wader boots) a trove of deals is to be had on products many didn't know they needed  or even wanted  before the intoxicating lure of The Bargain left them besotted.That's the thing about general merchandise auctions: They suck you in. It's part art of the deal, part blood sport when the bidding gets revved up. Call it capitalist Kabuki theater, replete with grand gestures, odd expressions and bold intonations  the difference being there's also a lot of substance there.Substance in the form of stuff. Stuff to fill your house, clog your garage, molder away in your shed. (Cue that hilarious old George Carlin monologue.)""Do I need 1,000 foam cups?"" said Bobby Archie, of West Sacramento, who snagged the booty for the low, low price of $7.50. ""No. I'll put 'em in my shop. Will I use 'em? Maybe.""Why, then, didn't Archie fork over another five bucks for the next item up for bid  lids?""You don't have to have a lid to drink, you know.""Right. And besides, he had other purchases to make: a tool chest for $10, a rainsuit for $10.50, a radial arm saw for a cool Benjamin. He lost out on a lighted vanity mirror in spirited bidding. Apparently, $25 was too rich for his blood.Strategic spending is the key. It makes people feel like a smart shopper to chop 80 percent off retail price of an item, as if putting one over on The Man  or The Corporation. It may not be something for which they had a hankering, but, dude, think of the deal! ""You gotta play the game,"" said Kevin Melvin, of Citrus Heights. ""Last week, I dropped about $500 here. This week, we'll see.""His T-shirt read ""Livin' Large,"" and Melvin seemed to embody the credo. An hour into the proceedings, he already had bought five items, the most pricy an air compressor (for $25, saving about $90). He was in the running for a Whirlpool washing machine ($700, retail), but when the bidding got above $45, bowed out. ""It might've just sat in the garage,"" he said, hardly crestfallen. ""But I'm getting all kinds of stuff for five bucks.""And just where does this ""stuff"" come from?Folkerts says, ""We buy truckloads of product from major department stores and chains and we'll have consignors, too. We're still testing the (Sacramento) market, what it can bear. Right now, looks like tools and electronics.""Case in point: A bidder in a camouflage jacket and ball cap, too enthralled to talk, went home with both a Starbucks whipped cream maker and a gasless wire-feed welder. Such an eclectic juxtaposition doesn't make Folkerts do a double-take. He's seen it all. ""I've sold TVs where they could've bought it at the store for less money than at the auction, but it gets to be a competition out there,"" he said. ""People do things they wouldn't normally (do).""Take Brett and Dorothy Mason, of Granite Bay, who came just to watch and went home with a case of Gold Eagle Fuel System Cleaner and a Bodum battery-operated milk frother. They needed the stuff, really. Brett often flushes out his cars' tanks and Dorothy could use the frother to make smoothies at work.Besides, they were such deals.""We may end up buying one of those $20 baskets to get all the stuff home,"" Brett Mason said, sipping on a Budweiser and trying mightily to abstain from bidding on that carpet cleaner he'd been eyeing."\u000a

V"Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's popular chamber musical ""Little Shop of Horrors"" has always thrived on cheeky simplicity. The story of a Faustian bond between an otherworldly plant that feeds on human blood and the unassuming florist shop worker who nurtures it provides comic guilty pleasure. The new, easygoing Sacramento Theatre Company production serves up this theatrical dessert with neither surprise nor disappointment.Director Michael Laun's clean, even production boasts a strong-voiced and well-balanced ensemble, which does solid work with the early 1960s doo-wop tunes by lyricist Ashman and composer Menken. The musical's two creators took B-movie maven Roger Corman's 1960 low-budget horror comedy and in 1982 turned it into a campy set piece that has become a regional theater staple. The small cast, single unit set, and catchy tunes make this a production within the reach of most theater companies. Here the effective cast is led by Andrew J. Perez as Seymour, the nerdy, put-upon florist, and Jessica Goldman as the relationship-challenged shop assistant Audrey. Both give broad, lively performances. Seymour has grown up in the skid row floral shop as the ward of owner Mushnik (Michael RJ Campbell) and he dotes on his co-worker Audrey. The shop teeters on the edge of shutting down until Seymour unveils an oddly compelling plant he has been growing in the back room. Before long, Seymour has become a horticultural celebrity, but the plant's dietary needs place unusual demands on Seymour.Perez shows a genuine wide-eyed innocence while Goldman effortlessly charms as the low-self-esteem assistant, shining on the wistful ballad ""Somewhere That's Green."" Audrey dates bad- boy dentist Orin Scrivello, who continually abuses her, which ultimately motivates Seymour to take action. William Elsman, now familiar to STC audiences for several roles over the last few years, has a field day here with numerous roles including the sadistic Orin on the multilevel parody ""Dentist!"" Jeffrey Lloyd Heatherly gives a dynamic performance as the compelling and soulful voice of the bloodthirsty Audrey II.Three local streetwise girls, Chiffon, Crystal and Ronette (Gabriella Isaguirre, Miranda Lawson, Ure Egbuho), form a Greek chorus setting the scene and commenting on the action throughout the story with '60s girl-group harmonies and choreography. Jerald Bolden created the dances and directed the essential puppeteers. Aaron Hitchcock cleverly manipulated the Audrey II; other puppeteers were Tom Block, Javen Crosby, Dafydd Wynn and Garrick Sigl. Dan Pool conducted the solid offstage four-piece band, but the sound was occasionally disrupted by a volume drop that was never corrected during the performance.There's nothing to take very seriously in this easily digestible ""Little Shop.""Little Shop of Horrors three 1/2 What: Sacramento Theatre Company production of ""Little Shop of Horrors""When: 6:30 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 2 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays through May 20.Where: Main Stage, Sacramento Theatre Company, 1419 H St. SacramentoTickets: $15-$38.

V"WASHINGTON  The House is expected to vote later today on an amendment pushed by Gulf State lawmakers to dedicate 80 percent of the fines collected from the BP oil spill to a trust fund for coastal restoration of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas.The Restore Act has been a top priority of Gulf State lawmakers, especially as the BP trial is due to start at the end of the month, and House Gulf members were able to inject the issue into the debate over energy and the surface transportation bill. Reps. Steve Palazzo, R-Miss., Steve Scalise, R-La., and Pete Olson, R-Texas, persuaded GOP leadership to agree to it.Wednesday, Palazzo said, ""I've received a lot of good news today: The House is slated to consider our amendment on Thursday morning, and the Chamber of Commerce has come out in support of this effort.""This amendment is a huge first step, and it will be the first time either house of Congress votes on bringing oil spill fines back to the Gulf Coast states.""Scalise said, ""This is a really important milestone. We feel like weve got a real opportunity to get this passed and get this fund in place.""The amendment would set up the Gulf Coast Restoration Fund for the five Gulf Coast states, and would set aside 80 percent of the Clean Water Act fines  an amount that could reach $20 billion.On April 20, 2010, the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing 11 workers and spewing 4.9 million barrels of crude oil over 87 days.A federal case with hundreds of consolidated lawsuits is scheduled to begin Feb. 27 before a judge in New Orleans. But Palazzo and other lawmakers anticipate a BP settlement with the U.S. government and want to get the amendment in place as soon as possible to ensure funds are aimed at the Gulf Coast.The amendment is a smaller version of the Restore Act, which Gulf lawmakers have been advocating for months. The amendment expected to be voted on today does not include the formulas distributing the funds, which Scalise said would be done later or possibly in the Senate.The EPA fines are separate from a $20 billion fund BP set up to compensate victims.""This is a large part of what weve been working for over the past year, and we wont stop until those fine dollars have been brought home to the Gulf Coast states,"" said Palazzo. Editors' note: An earlier version of this story reported incorrectly that the Restore Act amendment had passed late Wednesday. In fact, a related amendment was approved that would increase the amount of offshore drilling revenue to Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama for coastal restoration.MORE FROM MCCLATCHYBill to steer BP oil spill fines to Gulf states passes committeeFollowing complaints from Gulf, Congress seeks audit of BP oil spill funds"\u000a

V"The casting of Adam Pechal on ABC's ""The Taste"" made perfect sense. The chef and co-owner of Tuli Bistro and Restaurant Thir13en has a culinary school pedigree and paid his dues in some of Sacramento's top kitchens.Plus, the guy's known for his booming voice and sometimes brash attitude, a good combo for reality TV, a medium that banks on conflict among contestants.But in the end, ""The Taste"" was just that  a mere hint of Pechal's personality and cooking prowess. This past Tuesday, Pechal was eliminated from the show, which plays something like ""The Voice"" but with kitchen knives and exploding pressure cookers. His dish of Thai-influenced sweetbreads was given a thumbs-down by all-star judges including Anthony Bourdain and Nigella Lawson. Pechal was sent packing, his chances of winning $100,000 and a Ford C-Max Hybrid going up like a wisp of hot peanut oil smoke.""It was everything I expected it to be, and it wasn't,"" said Pechal on Wednesday. ""I wouldn't have traded the experience for anything.""Pechal still had a solid run on the show and represented Sacramento well. He endured four weeks of culinary challenges, plus the audition episode, which landed him a spot on Team Brian Malarkey, the ""Top Chef"" finalist who served as a judge and mentor on ""The Taste.""Ultimately, Pechal was one of the final 10 contestants (out of an initial 16) and was just a week away from landing in the semi- finals episode.Until getting dismissed, Pechal was an especially consistent chef on ""The Taste."" He won his spot with a seared-scallops dish that earned props all around the judging panel. From there, Pechal tended to land right in the middle of the playing field, never among the week's top chefs but not among those facing the chopping block  that is, until Tuesday.Some of Pechal's creations for ""The Taste"" were familiar to regulars of Tuli Bistro and Restaurant Thir13en. The pork-based Cubano from the show's sandwich challenge and the fried chicken he whipped up for the comfort food episode are all Pechal staples, but with some tweaks added for ""The Taste.""Pechal's usually amped-up attitude came in glimpses: describing a fellow teammate's dish as ""crap"" and pulling a few bossy alpha-male moves. In the end, the typical viewer will probably remember Pechal best as the wily-eyed chef with his long hair in a bun, the guy who made fun of Lawson's lilting British accent and said, ""If food's your drug of choice, you have to figure out a way to become the dealer.""The show itself is somewhat of a convoluted mess, like trying to force-feed the mentor concept behind ""The Voice"" into a cooking show. Contest rules are complicated, dishes get only cursory descriptions, and there's little time spent with contestants to get a sense of who these people truly are. Nobody's going to get much insight about cooking techniques from ""The Taste,"" but viewers will get the occasional feigned f-bomb from Bourdain and lots of wincing as dishes are tasted.""The Taste"" has still fared well in the ratings. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the show's Jan. 22 debut averaged a solid 2.2 rating among adults ages 18 to 49, or just a little over 6 million viewers. That rating's one-tenth of point higher than the ""Dancing With the Stars"" kickoff for its current season.Pechal's appearance on ""The Taste"" was some nice prime-time exposure for one of Sacramento's signature chefs, but that's likely where the impact ends for Sacramento's dining scene. Does anyone have a better sense of San Diego's dining culture from watching Malarkey on ""The Taste?""Pechal still did well with introducing some of his fellow contestants to Sacramento. Many of them attended his weekly viewing parties at Restaurant Thir13en, and one chef who was cut early from the show scoped out a possible job opportunity in Sacramento a few weeks ago.That's to say that Pechal's run on ABC might be done, but there's plenty more to taste from him.""I want to spend a little more time at Tuli, but also want to move in the direction of doing stuff outside the restaurants,"" said Pechal. ""I can see a book being a reasonable goal for the next year or so. You might just be seeing a little more of Adam Pechal."""\u000a

V"Rio Americano coach Jeff Hart has been around girls basketball for a long time.His daughter, Emily, was a member of the Bill Baxter-coached 1993-94 El Camino squad that went 36-0 and won the CIF State Division II championship.The Capital Athletic League was a previous home to El Camino, and spawned other Sac-Joaquin Section and state powerhouse teams through the years, including those from Nevada Union, Grant, Bella Vista, Del Campo and Sacramento.Hart coached girls basketball for 14 seasons at Loretto, leading the team to a D-IV section title in 2005, before the school closed in 2009.But even while realignment and demographic changes have made the CAL a shell of its once-formidable self, Hart's Raiders are doing something at the school unseen since Karen Smith and company were churning out section titles  six in all from 1977 to 1983.With three regular-season games to play, No. 11 Rio Americano (21-3, 7-0) has won 14 games in a row and has a shot at winning its first CAL girls basketball title in school history. The Raiders last won a girls title in 1987 as a Capital Valley Conference member.The CAL had long been dominated by Baxter-led El Camino teams (he won a section-best 601 games and 14 league titles before stepping down in 2011 to work as an assistant coach for the Sacramento State women).But Rio Americano won at El Camino 64-63 on Jan. 10 and 47-31 at home on Jan. 30, another rare accomplishment for the Raiders.""El Camino has been the leader of the pack in the CAL for a ton of years,"" said Hart, in his fourth season at Rio Americano. ""So to beat them twice in one season is pretty big for our program.""And a bit of a surprise, too.With just one major college recruit  junior all-around talent Daizy Wilson  Hart wouldn't call this his most talented team.""In years past, we've had more shooters, bigger post players,"" Hart said. ""But they play real well together, they really get along, and they're experienced.""Fourth-year varsity starter Elizabeth Moulton, a 5-foot-5 guard, leads the section in three-pointers made per game (3.3), set the school season three-point record this season with 65 and leads the team in scoring (15.6 points per game). She also twice set school records for three-pointers in a game with six, both times against El Camino.The 5-6 Wilson, a three-year varsity guard, averages 11.5 points and a team-leading 74 steals and 4.2 assists. Junior forward Emily Hansen averages 9.5 points and a team-high 7.6 rebounds, and senior post Samantha Reil set a school record for blocked shots with 48.Seniors Sierra Martinez, Julia Butterfield and Colette Hodges and junior Sydney Ford are role players who are trying to set a school defensive record.Rio Americano is allowing 38.7 points per game. The school record is 39.9.The Raiders are ranked second in the Division III power rankings. That could mean up to two home playoff games and a shot at going beyond the first-round exits of 2012 at Del Oro and 2010 at East Union in Manteca.Leaders of the pack  Wilton Christian junior Kayla Brown is the area leader in points scored (23.1) and steals (8.9) per game, as compiled by MaxPreps.com.Other area leaders: Rio Americano's Moulton, three-pointers (3.3), Antelope's Tyler Ellis, rebounds (16.9); Del Campo's Megan Roberson, blocked shots (7.8); Burbank's VyVy Tran and Rosemont's Irene Colaivalu, assists (5.8).Big Metro finish  The Metro Conference title and a long league winning streak could be on the line Friday when top-ranked Sacramento (20-4, 11-0) hosts No. 3 Kennedy (19-4, 10-1) and Monday when the Dragons travel to No. 4 McClatchy (20-3, 8-3).Kennedy (19-4, 10-1) enters tonight's game against winless Johnson with its only league loss to Sacramento, 53-49."\u000a

""I've been blessed with some good teams, and we have another pretty good one this year. They play real hard.""The Timberwolves are expected to challenge defending champion and No. 5 Del Oro and No. 12 Roseville for the league title, which Woodcreek hasn't won since 2007.Senior shortstop Paige Davis (.554, six RBIs), a four-year varsity player, is off to a strong start. Juniors Amanda Horbasch (5-0, 0.00 ERA) and Lexi Wilkerson (3-0, 0.32 ERA) lead on the mound.""We have a lot of talent, but we have to play well every game,"" Banks said. ""Our league is very competitive.""Another dream team?

Also back is senior outfielder Amber Glenn, who missed last season while recovering from injuries suffered in an auto accident.All grown up  The core of No. 7 Cosumnes Oaks' senior-led team has played varsity together since they were freshmen, when the newest Elk Grove district school opened.Senior infielder Taylor McClanahan, a captain as a freshman, has signed with Saint Mary's.Coach Lynda Bettencourt expects senior middle infielders Karyna Scott and Briana Pamplona to eventually earn college scholarships, too.And freshman catcher Sabryna Scott is being recruited by Tennessee and Cal, Bettencourt's alma mater.Something to prove  Losing 9-2 to Benicia in the first round of the Division III section playoffs last spring after winning four consecutive Division IV titles was a huge downer for a Bear River program used to nothing but success under veteran coach Duane Zauner, who entered this season with 323 wins.Shortstop Stephanie Ceo and catcher Alyssa Reina, both Bee All-Metro first-team players as juniors, return for the No. 16 Bruins. Ceo has signed with Texas; Reina with North Dakota.Senior Erin Nichol, who pitched sparingly last season (knee injury), is healthy again and joins returning senior starter Maddie Phelps.Marvelous in Metro  Rosemont is off to a 2-3 start, but things should pick up today when the Wolverines play at McClatchy in their Metro Conference opener.Coach Bill Kapp's Wolverines are three-time defending Metro champions and 43-1 in league the past three seasons.Kapp also returns the reigning Metro Conference Player of the Year, senior pitcher Aleshia Ayers (16-3, 1.46 ERA), who has signed with Villanova.

V"A first-half goal from Sunday Mbah was the difference as Nigeria claimed a 1-0 win over Burkina Faso in the final of the African Cup of Nations.Nigeria was bidding to win its third continental crown while Burkina Faso was appearing in the final for the first time after a surprising run through the tournament.Mbah's goal came in the 40th minute after a period of pressure from Nigeria when a shot from Victor Moses was deflected into his path and he hammered a volley past goalkeeper Daouda Diakite to put his side in front.Burkina Faso did well to remain within a goal and had a chance to level the match late in the second half when a powerful strike from Wilfried Sanou forced Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama to make a fine save, tipping the effort past the post.With the win, Nigeria will head to this summer's Confederations Cup in Brazil as the African representative."\u000a

""Possession after possession, we got big stops on defense and made big plays on offense. It took a lot of heart.""Uu finished with 12 points to lead the Marauders (27-6), who will play a Sheldon team that has beaten them seven consecutive times, including in the last two Sac-Joaquin section finals.""Maybe we can get over the hump,"" Harcos said.Sacramento (26-7) couldn't get over the hump against Miramonte (31-1), which made 11 three-pointers while playing with poise against the quick-handed Dragons.Sacramento closed to 55-53 with 3:18 on a Briana Womack jumper before the Matadors pulled away and stopped Sacramento's bid for a third consecutive NorCal title trip.Jasmine Ware closed a brilliant four-year career for the Dragons with 27 points."\u000a

And as time ran out, Sheldon public address announcer Herbie Berry dramatically announced that Jesuit had upended top-seeded De La Salle 44-41 in Concord in the other semifinal.Two Sacramento teams will for the first time meet for the prestigious Division-I championship  Saturday at Power Balance Pavilion.That showdown will come two weeks after the Delta River League rivals squared off for the third time this season in the Sac-Joaquin Section D-I final at Power Balance, won by Sheldon.""It'll be fun,"" Sheldon coach Joey Rollings said.Earlier, the coach told his team that Jesuit ""will come after you hard. We've come this close to our dream. Ice up, eat good this week, rest up because we have to be ready mentally and physically.""Sheldon jumped out early against the Warriors 16-4 only to have it tied 25-25 at the half. The Huskies (28-5) surged ahead 51-36 in the fourth quarter, then iced it on the free throw line down the stretch as McClymonds (19-11) scored baskets when it was too late to matter.Junior D'Erryl Williams was again superb at the point for Sheldon, laboring through a tender, heavily taped right small finger that was dislocated against Piedmont Hills of San Jose in a Saturday victory.Williams scored 14 points, had five assists and managed to protect his hand even though the McClymonds scorekeeper and fans urged Warriors players to do what they could to slap and bang on the finger to hurt Williams.Dakarai Allen, Sheldon's other superb junior guard, scored 12 points, Kyi Thomas had 11 points and seven rebounds, Nate Iese powered inside for 10 points and eight rebounds and Ryan Manning scored eight points and had seven rebounds.Needing a boost off the bench, the Huskies got that, too, when guard Antonio Lewis scored four points and provided solid defense.Lawrence Otis led McClymonds with 14 points. Dulani Robinson scored 13.Williams was the key, however, as his team shared the ball before getting sloppy late, and the Huskies played their trademark tough defense for good stretches.""I had to stay aggressive,"" Williams said.

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2012/07/24/4652985/cap-stages-dying-city-a-brilliant.html,"Christopher Shinn's emotionally harrowing ""Dying City"" works with wondrous efficiency. The 80-minute drama covers not one but two dark nights of the soul, concerning three characters played by two actors.The brilliant Sacramento- premiere production at Capital Stage lucidly handles the numerous strands of Shinn's moody, overstuffed plot through the remarkably accessible and intimate performances of Chad Deverman and Lyndsy Kail.Deverman plays Peter, a successful actor with a starring role in a major movie to his credit and a role in New York doing a high-profile revival of Eugene O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey Into Night."" There's plenty of intrigue in his work, but it's just deep background in ""Dying City's"" overall scheme.Deverman also plays Craig, Peter's identical twin brother, an Army company commander killed in Iraq a year before the 2007 play takes place. There's one significant difference between the brothers: Peter is gay; his social relationships affect the story.The action moves back and forth in time between two nights in the New York City apartment Craig shared with his wife, Kelly, a psychotherapist. Kail's Kelly displays a distantly scattered and slightly numb affect when Peter barges in on her the night we meet them. He's an erudite, self- effacing charmer, but his presence seems to push the already skittish Kelly into internal hysteria.As nonthreatening as Peter seems, his visit clearly has an agenda that Kelly doesn't want to deal with. As revelations of their history begin to unfold, there are numerous  almost too many  reasons that Peter would make Kelly uncomfortable.Of course he is the twin brother of her deceased husband, but Peter also does not believe the official report of Craig's death, which was listed as an accident. We also learn that Peter has been consistently trying to reach Kelly, and she has avoided him to the point that she changed phone numbers and is moving out of the city. Peter also was present the night before Craig left for Iraq for the last time, a goodbye-dinner party Kelly reluctantly agreed to let Peter and his boyfriend attend.The actors are extraordinary as they move between the two nights, with Deverman moving off stage as Peter and coming back as Craig inhabiting a subtly different physical comportment and changed vocal tonality as well. Kail similarly deftly flips the emotional heart of her character as the scenes toggle back and forth.Under Jonathan Williams' sympathetic direction, the actors perform a beautiful and wrenching duet.The play's minor failing is Shinn's need to cram too much into the dense plot so that what seem like major moments or revelations are quickly brushed aside, making way for the next piece in the queue. It's a consciously post-9/11 story, with that tragedy referenced along with the conflicting emotions around the ensuing military engagements.Shinn also layers in the deeply conflicted relationships between Kelly and the two brothers, one man she was married to and the other she wants nothing to do with.There are more questions than answers here, but the production casts a satisfying spell all the same.DYING CITY4 StarsWhat: Jonathan Williams directs Christopher Shinn's post-9/11 drama concerning the aftermath of a military death in Iraq.Where: Capital Stage, 2215 J St., SacramentoWhen: Continues at 7 p.m. Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Thursdays-Saturdays and 2 p.m. Sundays, through Aug. 12Tickets: $20-$32Information: (916) 995-5464, www.capstage.orgRunning time: 1 hour and 20 minutes, with no intermission"\u000a

At Davis, the Blue Devils hope to challenge No. 11 Elk Grove for the Delta Valley Conference championship after finishing second in 2011 to the Thundering Herd.The Blue Devils are led by senior first baseman Haley Cameron (.490), senior third baseman Rita Allen-Sutter (.391); returning all-league seniors Melanie Habib (.279), a shortstop, and Megan Winton (.380), a center fielder, and the pitching trio of sophomore Kaitlyn Lagattuta, junior Micke Cox and senior Alexandria Barbaria.""I've got 15 great kids and six seniors who are hungry to win,"" Guerra said. ""We're having a great time.""Davis athletic director Dennis Foster, a former Natomas AD, coaxed Guerra into applying for the job in Yolo County, even though it extended his commute from Roseville.""I told Dennis if he ever left Natomas, I'd follow him,"" said Guerra.

The threat came in an email received Saturday afternoon, after Maze had won the downhill race and broken the points record for a season.""That's sad. If somebody is strong and showing good performances and perfect in the thing you are doing, there are people who want to disturb you,"" Maze said. ""I guess it's part of the game but it didn't disturb me that much.""It shouldn't be part of the game but life is not perfect. It's not nice for me, it's not nice for my team. I haven't seen the email ... they want to ruin your day, ruin the record, but I enjoyed the day 100 percent,"" Maze said.Peter Fischer, chief of the organizing committee, said the email came from an anonymous source and that it was immediately turned over to the police.""We had to take it seriously, our job is to keep everyone safe here,"" Fischer said. ""Police took over the case and provided protection.""Maze said she had never felt safer in her life, ""I've had police in front my door all the time since yesterday.""Fenninger beat hometown favorite Maria Hoefl-Riesch by 0.20 of a second on the Kandahar course for her third career victory and second of the season. Julia Mancuso of the United States was third.Mancuso and Maze are still in competition for the season super-G title, which will now be decided at the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, in two weeks.Maze is already assured of the overall title and became the first skier to collect more than 2,000 points in a season by winning Saturday's downhill on the same slope. She now has 2,074 points.Mancuso said she lost the race in the middle section of the course.""I was not good in the turning section, I don't know what it is, maybe a question of confidence,"" said the American, who was second in Friday's super-G on the same slope.""I am happy to be on the podium, just trying my best every day.

Hoefl-Riesch, who was hoping for her 25th World Cup win, missed it by 0.20, while Mancuso was 0.23 off the pace. Maze was 0.43 0 back.""I deserved it, I was ready for this win and I believed in myself,"" Fenninger said. ""I made a few mistakes on the top part and really risked everything on the bottom section, but everything came together. It feels good.""Fenninger's previous two wins were in giant slalom.

Two seasons ago, when the Pride won the D-V section title and reached the CIF NorCal Regional semifinals, it started 2-6 en route to a 24-10 finish.But this season's Pride is 9-2 after winning the Jade Division championship at the West Coast Jamboree at College Park High School in Pleasant Hill.Bradshaw Christian walloped Madera 52-29 in Saturday's final, previously beating Davis of Modesto 73-35 and Grant 56-46.Coach Mike Ruble's team, led by seniors Ashlee Jones (a Nevada signee) and Briana Barnes and sophomores Erika Bean, Jordyn Bell and Macy Ketterling, still plays a strong schedule.Bradshaw Christian's two losses are to state power St. Mary's of Stockton and Southern California power San Clemente, the latter coming in the recent Nike TOC in Phoenix.Young Lions  No. 8 McClatchy, which plays host to Elk Grove tonight in a nonleague game, maintained its unbeaten run by breezing through the Lady Bulldog Winter Classic tournament over the weekend at Folsom High School.Coach Jessica Kunisaki's Lions topped Capital Christian 51-35 in Saturday's championship game.McClatchy's leaders in scoring (sophomore Destiney Lee, 12.3 points per game and freshman Gigi Garcia, 10.1) and assists (sophomore Lauren Nubla, 5.4 and freshmen Kelsey Wong, 3.2, and Kristi Wong, 2.4) are all underclassmen.The Lions enter the tough Metro Conference on Friday against visiting Valley, then travel to No. 3 Kennedy next Monday.Raiders are rolling  No. 14 Rio Americano handed No. 15 Bear River its first loss of the season en route to winning the 22nd annual Lincoln Invitational at Lincoln High School.Coach Jeff Hart's Raiders held off Bear River 44-37 in a Friday semifinal, and then topped Granite Bay 41-23 for the championship Saturday.The Raiders also edged River Valley 51-49 in the tourney opener Thursday, thanks to Daizy Wilson's buzzer-beating layup.Wilson, a junior, scored 39 points, had 15 rebounds and 13 steals in the three wins.

V"""Face Yourself"" at the Elliott Fouts Gallery is a show of self-portraits by artists who are not, for the most part, known for their figurative work. The result is a show that ranges from a straightforward, traditional self- portrait by Bryan Mark Taylor to a psychologically fraught painting by John Tarahteeff, who depicts himself as a sailor in a beached boat with a broken mast. Both are finely done and offer insights into the characters of the artists. Taylor's tender color and tactile paint handling give us a glimpse into the soul of an artist who is a sensitive colorist. Tarahteeff's symbolic painting suggests that he is a melancholy and self-dramatizing storyteller. Between these two extremes are some marvelous and surprising works. Jennifer Balkan gives us a piquant and painterly self-portrait as an angel with a crown of roses. This image, which is reminiscent of a Norman Rockwell (whose works are up at the Crocker), jumps off the wall with joie de vivre. Ryoko Tajiri abstracts her image with angular planes that in some senses efface her visage, but nevertheless offer a subtle and intriguing painting. John Karl Claes gives us a moody gestural image in sombre yet rich tones and Kenny Mencher challenges us with a dashing self-portrait in a Lone Ranger mask. Some of the artists present only portions of their faces or figures. Randy Brennan's ""I'm Complicated"" takes the form of a floral painting of vines and a vase that has sliding panels that open to reveal a mouth and an eye. James Crandall focuses on his hands intertwined and moving apart in a beautifully drawn image. Jelaine Faunce reduces herself to an Angelina Jolie-like pair of plump lips. Others let images or objects stand in for themselves. Maren Conrad fancies herself a sexy mermaid who ought to hang in the Dive Bar. Terry Pappas depicts herself as a Buddhist goddess with a bird. Teresa N. Fischer also holds a bird, a wind-up toy, to her ear, listening intently to its silent song. The most compelling work in the show is Gale Hart's image of a girl with an ax confronting a panel with a relief line drawing of the same figure. Both girls have one foot that belongs to a pony rather than a human, and the overall feeling is one of menace and anger. Hart, whose works often address animal rights, offers an emotive and ambiguous statement of human culpability here.All in all it's an enjoyable and thought-provoking exhibit, as is ""The Collector: John Turner and the Art of Acquisition"" across the street from Fouts at the Center for Contemporary Art, Sacramento. This delightful exhibition showcases objects from one man's collection of ethnographic, folk and outsider art. Turner, an inveterate traveler who moved with his family to Vietnam and Taiwan when he was a teenager, began his career as a film editor in New York City before moving to the Bay Area in the 1970s, where he worked as a television news editor, arts producer, writer and curator. Over the past 35 years, he has visited more than 70 countries, finding odd objects such as a coconut carved into an image of Fidel Castro. A haunter of thrift stores, he has acquired a marvelous selection of paintings, including a visionary image of Moses with the burning bush, an image of Elvis combing his hair in a mirror and a dark painting of two sullen young girls who seem to float on air. A medical sign from Mali depicts a dictionary of ailments from bad eyesight to flatulence. A high point of the exhibit are several works by the renowned outsider artist the Rev. Howard Finster, including a childlike rendition of Turner emerging from the Amazon River and a wonderful, etched sheet metal wall sculpture titled ""Queen Heneretta Wife of Charles I."" These are mind-boggling, strange and enchanting works.

The team ranked No. 1 by The Bee and in the section, and one spot higher than Franklin in the NorCal rankings? Elk Grove, which was founded in 1893.But there isn't an ounce of complaint coming from Franklin's players or coaches. Elk Grove has what Franklin wants  a Delta Valley Conference title and five section banners. Franklin coach Mike Johnson has a section championship, beating Elk Grove for the Division I crown in 2000 while coaching Lincoln of Stockton.Now his players at Franklin want their share.""This is our year because we have so many seniors,"" Franklin receiver Tre Lampley said. ""And we know how good Elk Grove is.""Though both teams run the ball to control the tempo, defense has been a strong point, too.Fresh off a 24-0 triumph over Grant, Elk Grove is paced on defense by lineman B'won Canada and linebackers Wadus Parker, Spencer Sheff and Elijah Jones.""Any defense that can shut out a Grant team at Grant deserves credit,"" Elk Grove coach Chris Nixon said.Nixon added that he knows the Thundering Herd faces its biggest test in Franklin, a team led defensively by tackle William Vi, linebacker Joey Banks and cornerbacks Marcus Green and Lampley.There will be no playoff rematch since Elk Grove will pursue a section D-II title and Franklin its first in D-I.Mirror programs  When Ernie Cooper became football coach at new Granite Bay 17 years ago, he measured his program against Del Oro, a Placer County school that rolled to Sierra Football League and section titles.Del Oro is now coached by Casey Taylor, in his 11th season, and the respect between the schools goes both ways.Sixth-ranked Granite Bay plays host to No. 10 Del Oro tonight for what could wind up being for the SFL crown. ""When we started, Del Oro was the cat's meow, the best football program in our area,"" Cooper said. ""If we wanted to be a player in this region, we had to step it up. Then Casey comes along, and if there's a better football coach around, I don't know who it is.""Taylor, The Bee's Coach of the Year in 2010, said it could well be Cooper, The Bee's 2011 Coach of the Year. With respect comes great admiration.""We push each other,"" Taylor said of the programs. ""We both got off to slow starts (combined 2-7), but look how things worked out. We're playing for first place.""Wolfpack as a pack  Cosumnes Oaks is 6-1 despite key injuries  including one to national recruit defensive lineman Sam Smith  with its only loss coming to Franklin 23-3.Coach Scooter Gomes said, ""We're more balanced than we've ever been,"" with quarterbacks in Alex Kropp and Jordan Ares, who throw to a rising national recruit in junior receiver Alex Van Dyke.The running game is paced by Kaelin Willhite, son of 1981 National Player of the Year Kevin Willhite of Cordova. Young Willhite has filled in admirably for injured captain Dwayne Darden (knee)."\u000a

V"The Grant Pacers are on the brink of rare territory: on the outside of the Sac-Joaquin Section playoff loop, and wondering what happened.At 2-5, Grant needs to win its final three Delta Valley Conference games  against Monterey Trail (5-2), Davis (4-3) and Laguna Creek (2-5)  to avoid its first losing season since 1990.The Pacers  in the midst of a brutal schedule that includes losses to top-ranked Elk Grove (24-0) and No. 2 Franklin (34-26) to open DVC play  have two reasons to continue the fight: pride and the knowledge that three Division I teams made the postseason last year at 5-5 in Jesuit, Rodriguez and Sheldon.""We have a good team that has underachieved,"" said Mike Alberghini, Grant's coach since 1991. His program has made the postseason 21 consecutive seasons, the second-longest active run in Northern California to De La Salle's NorCal record of 30.""Yes, we've played a lot of really good teams, and that's what we want, and it's something we'll always do, and teams play their best against us,"" Alberghini said. ""It's up to us to play better and we haven't, and that's on all of us  coaches and players. We need to be sharper. It's not about our kids not trying, or lack of talent. It's been a continuous set of mistakes.""And if we make the playoffs, I wouldn't fear anyone.""But can they get in? The Pacers need at least two league wins to even be considered, per section criteria. They have none at the moment. Grant outplayed Franklin in the second half two weeks ago but had a game-winning field-goal attempt blocked and returned for a score with no time left.Against Elk Grove, turnovers only allowed an excellent Thundering Herd team even more chances to gain control.""Keep in mind that if Grant were in many other sections in the state, it would be a playoff team,"" said Mark Tennis, editor of Cal-Hi Sports that has chronicled prep sports in the state for more than 30 years.""That section puts more of a premium on wins  have to have six (in most cases) to make the playoffs. Assuming Grant wins its last three games, there are a number of six-win playoff teams in Division I in which Grant is clearly superior.""A losing record would be the first in Alberghini's career as a football and baseball coach at the Del Paso Heights school in a combined 44 seasons. Grant this week fell out of The Bee's rankings for the first time since the first week of the 1991 season, Alberghini's first. The only regional program to rival Grant's staying power in the rankings would be Cordova, which led the nation in wins from 1970 to 1986 and was ranked each season. Grant led the area in wins in the 1990s and 2000s."\u000a

V"Much more needs to be done to lower the risks of another offshore oil disaster like the BP blowout two years ago in the Gulf of Mexico, the presidential commission that investigated the disaster reported Tuesday in its first progress update.The presidential oil spill commission disbanded after it finished its main report last year, but its seven members recently got together again to look back on whether their recommendations had been carried out. Many steps to prevent or sop up another oil blowout havent been taken.The risks will only increase as drilling moves into deeper waters with harsher, less familiar environmental conditions, the report says. Delays in taking the necessary precautions threaten new disasters, and their occurrence could, in turn, seriously threaten the nations energy security. The Gulf oil spill began with an explosion of a deepwater well on April 20, 2010, killing 11 men. Failure of its blowout preventer, a device meant to seal off the well in an emergency, resulted in the release of more than 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The Interior Department addressed the problems of blowout preventers in an interim rule in 2010, and its working on a new regulation that will upgrade the requirements significantly, the report said. But the department hasnt issued rules to correct the design flaw of the blowout preventer that made it fail to operate properly. It also hasnt followed a recommendation to require that blowout preventers and other equipment have sensors that show how well theyre functioning.In a section on the Arctic Ocean, the commission calls for more money to increase the scientific understanding of the regions environment and wildlife in areas where drilling is expected. The Obama administration is near final approval for Shell Oil to drill this summer in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. The commissioners point out that the Coast Guard has said it isnt capable of responding to an oil spill in the Arctic. They called for industry to demonstrate that it can contain and clean up an oil spill in Arctic conditions.  Shell and government agencies conducted Arctic oil-spill exercises last month. The industry also has experimented with burning spilled oil and recovering it with machinery in icy conditions in Norway and in a lab, but these techniques have not been successfully tested in the extreme weather conditions that are often present in Arctic waters, nor (have) they been evaluated in any significant way by government entities, the commissioners reported.The environmental advocacy group Oceanas senior scientist Jackie Savitz said the oil spill commissions overall recommendations were too weak in the first place and werent being followed: So what were left with is a situation where not much has changed, and we could have the same spill any day. Oceana released its own report Tuesday on how well the commissions recommendations were carried out. It gave the government and industry Fs and Ds.Oil spill-response plans filed before the BP disaster in some cases listed the walrus as a local species in the Gulf, evidence of careless clip jobs from Alaska plans. That no longer happens, and the quality of the reviews has improved, Oceana said. Still, it said that the government underestimates the risks of spills and potential damage from spills, and uses these low estimates to justify more drilling.Oceana also argued that the government hadnt made sure that the industry is prepared to deal with spills. As one example, it said that Interior had approved applications with claims that companies could skim up far more oil than theyd ever done before.Oceana and the presidential commission made some identical criticisms. Both, for example, said that the industrys Center for Offshore Safety, which was created in response to the BP spill, should be independent and not under the control of the industrys lobby group, the American Petroleum Institute.The oil industry also set up two consortiums to provide well-containment equipment. Two years ago, the equipment didnt exist and it took three months to create it while the oil gushed. Now it could take several weeks to deploy these systems, the commissioners said. Some also question whether these systems have been adequately proven to be effective under the difficult conditions of deep water drilling.  The commissioners gave the industry a C plus.  Erik Milito, the American Petroleum Institutes group director of upstream and industry operations, told reporters last week that the industry conducted a ""comprehensive reappraisal of safety for offshore operations."" Two years later, he said, that evaluation has led to significant safety enhancements in the offshore business and an enhanced framework of rules, standards and oversight to ensure the highest level of safety for the development of our ample offshore resources. The commissioners graded Congress with a D for, among other things, failing to pass legislation that would improve oil drilling management. The commissioners report also said that the House of Representatives had passed several bills that contained provisions that ran contrary to the recommendations, including requirements for leases in the Gulf without adequate reviews. Congress also hasnt passed the commissions recommendation that 80 percent of all penalties from the spill go to long-term restoration of the Gulf."\u000a

V"After nearly canceling its spring musical following a burglary of money, Oakmont High School drama students are eager to show their appreciation for generous donations that kept the show going.The drama department will host a free showing at 2 p.m. Saturday of its ""Little Shop of Horrors"" musical, which was made possible by more than $11,500 in donations.""It's really meant for those who donated or supported us in some way, but we have no way to find that out,"" said drama teacher Samantha Howard. ""It's a way to say thank you for all the support we received.""Approximately $3,000 was stolen March 10 from a cash box inside Howard's desk inside her locked office, which is inside a locked rehearsal room at the Roseville school.The money was raised from a previous student-directed show to pay for the spring musical. Howard said she had planned to deposit the money into a school account.A 17-year-old boy was arrested March 31 on suspicion of burglary after he came to the Roseville Police Department with a parent to talk about the Oakmont burglary.Approximately $500 cash was recovered and returned to the school, said Dee Dee Gunther, a spokeswoman for the Roseville Police Department. Gunther said she could not disclose whether the teen is an Oakmont student.After media reports about the possible cancellation of Oakmont's musical, Howard said students received more than $11,500 in donations. One person donated $3,000.Howard said everyone who donated after the $3,000 target was met was told Oakmont had raised what was needed.""Everyone who donated from then on did so knowing we had enough money,"" Howard said.

V"The sublime new production of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" at the Music Circus gives the summer series its most poignant and affecting moment of the season.The beleaguered dairyman Tevye, played by the gifted comic actor Bob Amaral, and Tevye's staunch wife, Golde, a moving and splendid Adrienne Barbeau, sit together assessing their life. They are modest working people who grew up never questioning the traditions now being assailed all around them. In the charming song ""Do You Love Me?"" they ask, after 25 years of an arranged marriage: Do they love each other? With a line of wonderfully understated sentiment, Golde concludes, ""I guess I do."" The longtime partnership of Tevye and Golde counterpoints the relationships of their daughters Tzeitel (Lauren T. Mack), Hodel (Leah Horowitz), and Chava (Kristen J. Smith), whose choices in husbands will challenge everything their parents believe.Following one of the earliest rules of Broadway success, ""Fiddler on the Roof"" tells its audience early on what the show is about: tradition. We hear and see it in the heartfelt musical's very first song as Amaral's Tevye and the villagers of Anatevka in 1905 czarist Russia tell us what keeps them going. Specifically Jewish and Old World traditions such as matchmaking, which makes the problem of finding the right mate as much a business venture as a love match. The three eligible daughters increasingly test their parents' convictions, as first Tzeitel asks her father's permission to marry the tailor Motel (Allen E. Read) for love, rejecting a more profitable match with the successful local butcher. Then Hodel tells Tevye she doesn't need his permission to marry Perchik (Jordan Bondurant), a politically active student. Finally, Hodel takes an unthinkable step with Fyedka (Will Taylor), who is not of their faith. The book by Joseph Stein, with music by Jerry Block and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, are based on stories by Sholem Aleichem. While marriages in the show symbolize the characters' changing world, the impeccable marriage of performers Amaral and Barbeau elevates the production with their complementary strengths. Amaral mines Tevye's bemused comic Jewish blues while Barbeau offers a determined, soulful life partner. Musical director Jeff Rizzo deftly leads the orchestra through the rich score, which includes some of the more elegant underscoring you will hear, and there's solid singing up and down the cast. Master puppeteer Richard Bay created the humorous puppets, and Bob Richard choreographed the celebratory dance sequences. Director Glenn Casale creates a simple but actively emotional world for this most satisfying production.The world hasn't stopped changing, so the themes of ""Fiddler"" continue resonating as cultural touchstones are still tightly grasped or roughly overturned when they can't or shouldn't be sustained.FIDDLER ON THE ROOFFour StarsWhat: The classic musical about the travails of dairyman Tevye and his family in czarist Russia.

""And getting drafted, you never forget it. It's so special.""In 1980, James' mother, Evelyn Ayres, fielded that draft call in their home located a relay throw from McClatchy.""Son, I think you better take this,"" she said calmly.It was a Milwaukee Brewers executive. James was drafted in the first round, No. 25 overall. He recalled dancing to the point that the family dishes shook.""When I got that draft call, I was ready to go,"" said James, 49. ""I was ready to work. I loved watching Reggie Jackson and Vida Blue. I wanted to be like them.""James logged 11 big-league seasons with the Brewers, Braves, Indians and Yankees, and had a stint in Japan.These days, James keeps tabs on his three sons. Two play baseball. Justin James was drafted by the Yankees in the 13th round last year out of Sacramento City College. He signed to play the outfield.Jared James, also an outfielder, was this season's Metro Conference MVP as a senior at McClatchy. He was not drafted this week but will continue to chase the dream at Sac City.Youngest son Jarvis is a sophomore at McClatchy. He played Little League baseball before deciding he preferred to have a different stick in his hands in a pursuit requiring patience and persistence.""We fish a lot,"" Dion James said with a laugh. ""There's a lot less anxiety with a fishing pole. That's our release. I don't mind him not playing baseball.  If you don't love it, if you don't have fun with it, then it doesn't work.""Baseball is fun for Jared James, who rejoices in hitting home runs.""I can't help it  I like to dance around the bases,"" said Jared, who hit seven home runs this season. ""A home run never gets old.""Jared didn't homer in the River Cats Showcase Game of area seniors last week at Raley Field, but he did smack a triple. Waiting for him at third base was his father, one of the coaches. They high-fived and embraced.""I'm so lucky to have a dad who knows the game, who taught me so much,"" Jared James said.At 6-foot-5 and 230 pounds, Justin towers over his 6-2 father. Jared is 6-3 and 215 pounds.""Oh, they're so much bigger and stronger and faster than I was at that age,"" Dion James said.James said he was conflicted watching his sons play through the years. As much as the major leaguer in him wanted to push them to succeed, he tried not to be an overzealous parent.""We have a lot of parent involvement in youth baseball, and not always good,"" James said. ""I've been guilty of that. I've been the supportive parent, and I've been the crazy parent. You have to remember it's about the kids.""Watching was fun but not always easy. You felt helpless. You can't get a hit for them. You can only help them with guidance if they want it, and you hope they do well and enjoy the game like I did."""\u000a

Vhttp://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/27/5220647/sacramento-council-approves-arena.html,"For the first time in the latest effort to keep the Kings, the Sacramento City Council has opened its checkbook and dispatched top city officials to enter into formal negotiations over the financing of a new downtown sports arena.The council voted 7-2 on Tuesday night to grant its approval of City Manager John Shirey's request to negotiate the terms of a new arena plan that is seen as a key element of the city's work to block a Kings move to Seattle. Council members Kevin McCarty and Darrell Fong opposed the request.With the vote, the council allowed Shirey to spend $150,000 on attorneys and arena financing consultants.In an unusual twist, city officials have declined to identify the investment team with whom they intend to negotiate as early as today.Aides to Mayor Kevin Johnson have said the mayor is confident a Kings purchase proposal will be submitted by Friday  perhaps at Johnson's State of the City address Thursday evening. It has been reported for weeks that Johnson is recruiting 24 Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov and Southern California billionaire Ron Burkle to make that bid for the Kings.That pitch will be presented to the NBA as a competing offer to the deal the Kings owners have to sell the franchise to a group seeking to move the team to Seattle. The NBA's board of governors will rule on the Seattle bid at its mid-April meeting.Shirey said he would attempt to bring a financing term sheet to the City Council by mid-April  a timeline he described as ambitious.""Nothing gets approved until this City Council approves a preliminary term sheet and gives us the authority to proceed further,"" Shirey said.Most council members said they were comfortable allowing Shirey to work on that term sheet, knowing they will have final say over whether the plan is accepted.""We don't have all the facts yet, we don't have all the tools we need to make a proper analysis,"" said Councilman Steve Hansen. ""We're at the beginning of this process.""City officials have acknowledged that while some of the deal points from last year's failed arena plan remain in place, the term sheet they will negotiate will likely be substantially different this time around.The city will negotiate with a potential new ownership group of the Kings and will explore building a facility at the site of Downtown Plaza after settling on the downtown railyard last year.As it was in last year's failed arena plan, the majority of the city's contribution is expected to be generated through the leveraging of downtown parking operations through either a city-operated finance authority or a lease agreement with a private operator. That plan could account for as much as $250 million.Land sales, ticket surcharges and assessments paid by property owners near the arena are also on the table.Assistant City Manager John Dangberg said it was the city's preference to own the arena and lease its use to the Kings and an operator. Any arena agreement must also come with a long-term commitment by the Kings to remain in Sacramento.Opponents of the arena plan continued to describe the effort as a risky endeavor for a city facing an unsettled budget.In a letter to the mayor and City Council, the Sacramento Taxpayers Association expressed concerns over who would cover potential cost overruns from the arena project and criticized the city for proposing a larger subsidy than the contribution approved by King County and the city of Seattle for an arena there.Arena supporters countered that a new arena would attract music acts that currently skip Sacramento and inject new life into Downtown Plaza and the rest of downtown.As Johnson's self-imposed March 1 deadline of announcing an investment team nears, Councilman Kevin McCarty said he has spoken with Kings minority owner John Kehriotis about Kehriotis' interest in making a bid to buy the team. McCarty is the lead opponent of the mayor's effort, and it is unclear whether Kehriotis has spoken to other council members.""I think it's a no-brainer we should look at that proposal,"" McCarty said of the Kehriotis plan.Two sources who said they are in contact with Kehriotis said he has told them he is trying to assemble $700 million in financing to make an offer on the team and to build a new arena, possibly without city funds. Kehriotis declined to comment, however, when contacted by The Bee.""I can't comment on it right now,"" he said. ""Maybe in a few days. We'll see.""The mayor's office did not immediately respond to a Bee question about whether officials have talked with Kehriotis about an alternative bid.Meanwhile, the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy sale of a 7 percent share of the Kings might accelerate the sale. The decision could play a role in the struggle between Seattle and Sacramento for control of the team.Trustee David Flemmer, who controls the 7 percent stake held by minority owner Bob Cook, has suggested that whoever buys the Cook share could have the right to match the Seattle group's offer for the Maloofs' controlling interest in the Kings.The auction isn't supposed to be wrapped up until May  after the NBA rules on the fate of the Seattle purchase  but the timeline could be sped up, Flemmer's lawyer Don Fitzgerald said in court Tuesday.""There's lots of activity,"" he said. ""It's a little like a water polo game. Things are calm on the surface, but there's a lot going on underneath."""\u000a

They expired a few days ago.I'm a single mom and recently lost my job. I've been overwhelmed and did not notice the email that warned me about the expiration of the miles.I called US Airways, but a representative said I was too late. I've been a loyal US Airways customer for years, but didn't sign up for US Airways' loyalty program until recently.My son almost had enough miles for an award ticket. I don't want him to lose his miles, which he was planning to use when he graduated from high school. I don't want to lose my miles, either.US Airways says it will reinstate my miles for $150, but I can't afford it. And honestly, we've earned those miles. Can you help? Marianne MacKenzie, Lakewood, Colo.I'm sorry to hear about your circumstances. When you called US Airways, it should have shown more compassion toward your situation and considered extending the life of your award miles.But it didn't have to. The terms and conditions of your US Airways miles are clear: Use 'em or lose 'em. You squirreled away your points as if they were acorns, which unfortunately they are not. Miles depreciate over time, and often expire when they aren't put to good use.Not that they are of any use. For many leisure travelers, frequent-flier miles have a negative value. What do I mean by that? Well, say your son books an award seat, and you decide to fly with him. If US Airways' flights are more expensive than those of a competitor, and if your son previously chose US Airways over another cheaper airline when he earned the miles  which is what happens often  then the miles effectively have a negative value. In other words, they cost more than they were worth.By now, you already know that you could have easily avoided this by not allowing your miles to expire. All it takes is a little activity on your account, and you get to keep the points.I think US Airways' offer to reinstate your miles for $150 was a little high  you could probably buy the ticket you wanted for about that much. What's more, it didn't really take into account your own situation. Every decision to apply an airline's rules should factor in a passenger's personal circumstances. Unfortunately, this one didn't.I contacted US Airways on your behalf, and it reinstated your miles."\u000a

V"Playwright Michael Elyanow's tumultuous world-premiere comedy-drama ""Robyn Is Happy"" at B Street Theatre veers across wide swaths of dramatic territory.It details the changing relationship of three lifelong friends over a year in the women's lives. Opening as a jokey series of very funny one-liners, the play left-turns into an escalating series of dramatic confrontations before climaxing with a wildly entertaining, unpredictable finish. Set in present-day Chicago, Elyanow's trio of adult women  Robyn (Elisabeth Nunziato), Trudy (Amy Kelly), and Hannah (Melinda Parrett)  have been best friends since the second or third grade, depending on who's counting. Drawn together by matching birthmarks on their thumbs, they have forged separate careers while maintaining a singularly close relationship.Nunziato's effervescent Robyn is an attorney at a big-time law firm; Kelly's halting Trudy teaches at a Waldorf school, and the resolute Hannah has her own marriage and family therapy practice. The union of onstage friends makes for a sterling combination of complementary actors with numerous strengths. Nunziato and Parrett each maintain seemingly effortless dramatic connections while Kelly's comedic gifts make Trudy's passive honesty a continued gold mine of laughs throughout the show.The united front has cracked, though, with the disintegration of Robyn's 14-year marriage to Dean, an academic. Feeling liberated, Robyn has been living it up, but in the eyes of Hannah, she's having too much fun. Having glimpsed Robyn in flagrante delicto at an office party, Hannah feels an intervention is needed and pulls Trudy into the action. While initially comic and clever, Elyanow's script has roots in the very real and uncomfortable dilemma of just how aggressively we should insert ourselves into someone else's life. What choices do we have to accept whether we agree with them?Hannah feels Robyn's companion of choice is inappropriate. Robyn acknowledges that it might be a little unconventional, but for the first time in her adult life she feels happy. Trudy soon follows with her own less-than-traditional choice, finding previously elusive happiness as well. Hannah eventually finds herself battling her friends as they make lives she does not approve of.Samantha Reno's bright set nimbly rotates as it becomes the women's different apartments. Director Buck Busfield effectively focuses on the shifting relationships despite Elyanow's pushing the story into creatively unlikely situations. The playwright provides plenty of bracing writing even as he telegraphs bits of the narrative. Although the finale feels underdone, his audacity triumphs.ROBYN IS HAPPYFour StarsWhat: The B Street Theatre world premiere of Michael Elyanow's comedy-drama When: 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays; 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays; 5 and 9 p.m. Saturdays; 2 p.m. Wednesdays and Sundays, through April 14.Where: The B Street Theatre Mainstage, 2711 B St., Sacramento.Tickets: $23-$35, $5 student rush.

V"""How did all these people get in my room?""Tommy Emmanuel quoted the song from I Blame Coco in response to the fact he'll occupy a legendary dressing room at John Ascuaga's Nugget when he performs in the Celebrity Showroom on Thursday.A mention of some of the entertainers who have played there prompts his quick question.In fact, Emmanuel seems a bit more interested in Nevada casino entertainment than in his own appearance.""I got to know Les Paul really well in his last years, and he told me stories of Nevada where Nat King Cole, who was the biggest thing in New York, for instance, had to enter the casino showrooms where he played through the kitchen door.""True enough. Reno, too, had such policies well into the 1960s.""In Australia, too, sadly,"" said Emmanuel of his home nation, where he began to establish his legendary guitar style. ""I saw this series of photographs once where the English people were in a front section of a theater, the white but non-English people in the middle, the natives further back. As the photos got closer to modern day, the white classes mixed, and then all classes mixed.""Emmanuel grew up during that civil rights progress. Born in 1955, he was part of a traveling family band by age 6, playing rhythm guitar.By his teen years, he had established himself in Sydney, where he played drums in the band Goldrush. Then he moved to lead guitarist with the Southern Star Band. Next he was with Dragon.""But I live in Nashville now, where I started living in 1980. I came to Nashville to meet Chet Atkins, and we became family and recorded together. Besides, Nashville is an affordable place to live for musicians.""The 1997 Emmanuel- Atkins collaboration, ""The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World,"" was the last recorded album of guitar legend Atkins, who called Emmanuel ""one of the greatest guitar players I have ever seen.""One of Emmanuel's first vivid memories comes from when he was 7, hearing Atkins on the radio. He was fascinated with the Atkins style, playing bass with the thumb and melodies with the first two or three fingers. It became Emmanuel's style as well, although he's developed a vast repertoire of techniques over the years allowing him access to pretty much all styles of music  rock, jazz, country, blues. He's also known as a fine storyteller.""I very rarely, if ever, go on stage with a set list. A minute before I go on, I decide what to play first, and from then on it's total freedom. It's a bit of a ride musically and emotionally. I'm not there to impress other musicians and all that rubbish. I can go from the Beatles (he wrote 'Papa George' and 'Hope Street' for George Harrison) to 'Over the Rainbow.' I feel the audience. I love improv.""The range of locations Emmanuel has played is as broad as his range of styles. Saloons, nightclubs, the Sydney Opera House, the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and command performances for the likes of the Australian prime minister and the king of Thailand.""That was an open-air event. The king plays saxophone and is a bit of a jazzer. I played solo and then joined kind of a superband at the end.""He'd wave and applaud and smile from ear to ear. It was so evident how much he is loved by the people.""Right now, Emmanuel is working on a project with Martin Taylor and starting to write a new solo project. He's also ""looking forward to playing in Reno for the first time, especially on that stage.""Solo. Improv. No backup.""Backup band? Backup band?

V"Jerry Manuel still lives baseball. He watches it, studies it and breaks it down for the MLB Network.Though his managing days with the Chicago White Sox and New York Mets are behind him, Manuel remains a teacher of the game. As such, he's hosting a free baseball clinic designed for African American players in the sixth through eighth grades Saturday at 10 a.m. at Capital Christian High School.The former standout player at Cordova is also exploring the idea of creating a charter school through his Jerry Manuel Foundation to mirror the foundation's motto of ""Cultivating Greatness.""Most of all, Manuel wants to see young African Americans playing baseball again.""We need to raise awareness of the lack of African Americans in this sport,"" Manuel said. ""We've lost those kids in baseball  definitely lost them.""Manuel is an example of what a groomed infield, a batting cage and a uniform can do for a young man. He continues to work with youth teams, to speak at events  anything to spread the word about the beauty of baseball.Manuel said he is dismayed that Little League teams are often ""drained"" by the allure of other travel teams, and how some African Americans are being left behind because of the cost to play the game. Even in middle schools, Manuel said, too many kids specialize in one sport and miss a broader experience.Manuel said he was impressed that Grant's Shaq Thompson, a national football recruit headed to Washington, returned to play outfield for the Pacers this spring. Leon Lee, Manuel's longtime friend who starred at Grant in the 1960s and was a home run legend in Japan, was equally impressed. Lee will assist Manuel at Saturday's clinic.""Shaq doesn't realize the impact he's making for young kids, that they'll look up to him and want to play baseball, too,"" Manuel said. ""I love it. That's what we need.""For more info, go to jerrymanuelfoundation.com.  Around the diamonds Grant is off to a 4-1 start under coach Danny Chavez, a star pitcher for the Pacers' last title team in 1989. Fernando Via, a star infielder for Valley in 1987 who later played in the majors and now does commentary work for the A's, spoke glowingly of Elk Grove junior infielder Dom Nunez and freshman Nick Madrigal when he saw them play Wednesday. ""They're great,"" Via said. F.P. Santangelo is at Oak Ridge, nearly three decades after his dad of the same name excelled for the Trojans. The elder Santangelo is a color commentator for the Washington Nationals. Pioneer pitcher Thomas Galart, a key for a team aiming for a Division III championship, is the son of Kevin Galart, an ace for Woodland in the 1980s. Pioneer pitcher Zack Aukes will undergo Tommy John surgery next month, but it doesn't mean the end of his baseball career.

Dianne Feinstein of California and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are being honored for displaying civility in politics, a rare Washington commodity theyll need plenty of in the coming months as they champion the divisive issues of gun control and immigration legislation.The senior senators from one of the countrys bluest states and one of its reddest will be feted next week at a National Press Club reception, where theyll receive the Allegheny College Prize for Civility in Public Life.Our winners this year could not be more different, James Mullen, the president of the private liberal arts college in Meadville, Pa., said in a news release Thursday. Senator Feinstein is a proud Democrat from the heart of American liberalism in San Francisco. And Senator Graham is a proud Republican son of the conservative South.Feinstein, a fifth-term lawmaker whos the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, last month introduced legislation to prohibit the sale of assault weapons, a ban that lapsed in 2004, a decade after Congress first imposed it.Graham, in his second term, is helping to lead a bipartisan group of eight senators who are pushing an overhaul of the nations patchwork immigration system, with tougher border enforcement in exchange for a path toward citizenship for 11 million undocumented residents.Senators Feinstein and Graham are proud partisans who battle vigorously on the most contentious issues of the day, Mullen said in the release. They fight the hard fights, take on the big issues and strive mightily to win. But they dont seek to win at all costs. They each have long records of doing battle with deep respect for the political process and abiding civility toward those they engage.Graham and Feinstein are scheduled to discuss their approaches to politics at the ceremony Tuesday, when theyll receive their awards.Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who also served as the first secretary of homeland security, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, will help deliver the awards.PBS commentators David Brooks and Mark Shields received the Allegheny College civility prize last year, the first time it was given by the school, which was founded in 1815."\u000a

V"Kris Richardson and Troy Taylor bear the expressions of men mired in serious business.With shaved heads and barks that could feather back the hair of any teenager, the co-head coaches at Folsom High School have the attention of their team  and soon, perhaps, the entire the state.While Richardson and Taylor are both in their mid-40s, they're really kids at heart. They hustle about practice and along the sideline on game nights like boys showing off their new toys on Christmas morning, as if to say, ""You think that was cool? Let's try this play!""The Bulldogs have stormed to a 13-0 record with dizzying offensive numbers, a sound defense and a unique philosophy about fourth downs.Folsom is ranked No. 2 in Northern California by MaxPreps.com entering Saturday's Sac-Joaquin Section Division II championship game against Elk Grove. Should Folsom defeat the Thundering Herd, state No. 1 De La Salle of Concord likely looms in a NorCal Regional Open game at Sacramento State next week, presenting the ultimate challenge against the ultimate program. De La Salle hasn't lost to a NorCal foe since 1991  237 games ago.""It's amazing what (Folsom has) done,"" said Tom Doherty, a former Folsom coach whose Bulldogs ran the ball between the tackles to section championships in 1989 and 1990. ""Just amazing. But don't talk about punting, please.""Punt. It's the nastiest four-letter word used at Folsom, and those who dare utter it are liable to have their mouths washed out with soap.The Bulldogs have punted five times this season.""And five times, I was physically ill because we hate to punt,"" Taylor said. ""We've done studies on it. It doesn't always make sense for us to punt. We'd get 19 yards net off a punt, so why do it? We feel like we can get first downs. We've converted more than 70 percent on fourth down. It works for us.""So does an offense that initially drew a lot of raised eyebrows and doubt. Folsom coaches over the years heard all the reasons why the spread wouldn't work. It's too fancy. You need better athletes. It won't fly in the rain, or the mud or against speedy teams.Folsom squashed all critics in 2010 when it won the CIF State D-II title in the mud against nationally ranked Serra-Gardena. The Bulldogs first had to beat state-ranked No. 1 Grant in the D-II section finals that year.""We tried going with the I-back, downhill, power-running game years ago, and we'd go 6-4, but it wasn't working for us,"" Richardson said. ""So we went with something different. We said, 'Let's spread teams out.' Other teams want to try the spread, but you have to have the right players, and a great line, or your quarterback's going to really get hurt.""Richardson, a towering figure at 6-foot-7, was a tackle at the University of New Mexico in 1991 when the Lobos passed 40 times a game. He now works with an offensive line on pass-protection technique, knowing that to stall Folsom is to reach the passer, which few have done in 2012.The Bulldogs' line of Josh Wormley, Mike D'Ottavio, Reed Garmsen, Dalton Bledsoe and Cody Creason take it personally if sophomore quarterback Jake Browning is touched. With 4,763 passing yards and 58 touchdown passes, Browning could become the second player in state history to eclipse 5,000 yards in a season. Former Folsom quarterback Tanner Trosin was the first to reach the milestone last season. And Browning is within reach of the state season mark of 63 touchdown passes. His targets include Troy Knox (90 catches, 1,107 yards, 13 touchdowns), Lucas Owan (1,195 yards, 10 TDs) and Phillip Carter (643 yards, 11 TDs).""He's very accurate, very good  we're all impressed with Jake,"" said Carter, who also plays cornerback and is a defensive leader along with linemen Chaz Arnold and Quincy Capel and linebacker Derek Stiles. ""Nothing rattles Jake.""Taylor is the play caller and offensive coordinator of Folsom's arsenal, and he spends hours breaking down film with Browning and friends.Taylor has no regrets leaving his job in the Cal football radio booth and returning this season to Folsom, where he coached four seasons last decade. He said he's happy to be working with high school kids after considering other options.""I've got tremendous peace in my life,"" said Taylor, a record-breaking quarterback at Cordova and Cal before embarking on a two-year career in the NFL. ""I'm affecting young lives, coaching. There's purpose in what we're doing, and we're having fun. I might've been a head coach in college by now or interviewing for a job, but I chose this. I wanted a full life. I didn't want to sacrifice it, and I couldn't be happier.""Richardson said Taylor's return has rejuvenated him, saying: ""I don't feel so worn out. This can be such a consuming job.""He calls Taylor the best ""offensive mind and play caller I've been around.""The Bulldogs' varsity team isn't the only talk of the town. The freshman and junior varsity teams had dominating seasons, combining for an 18-2 record. Even the youth programs that wear the same red and blue and go by Bulldogs won championships this season. The youth players attend Folsom's games and look up to the varsity players as heroes. A flood of junior Bulldogs are expected at Sac State to watch Saturday night, even in the wind and rain that is expected.""Everything's going great right now,"" Richardson said. ""It's like the perfect storm."""\u000a

V"STOCKTON  They are brothers, roommates and best friends.Rest assured, Friday night lasted into the wee hours amid fast food and game-day projections.Franklin High School baseball coach Bryan Kilby and brother Brad, the pitching coach, left Pacific plotting new strategies after a frustrating 4-2 loss to St. Mary's in the opener of the best-of-three Sac-Joaquin Section Division I championship series.The Rams of Stockton made it 2-0 in the second inning on a chopper to third that was lost in the sun, then pulled ahead in the bottom of the fifth on a sacrifice fly by Charlie Gaff and an RBI double by J.J. Wagner.Joey Caffese and Kyle Cortopassi kept the Wildcats of Elk Grove in check with a four-hitter for the program's 18th victory in 20 outings.Franklin starter Kyle Von Ruden pitched well, striking out six and allowing four runs in a complete game, but his team managed just one two-out hit and stranded runners in five of the seven innings. Still, the Wildcats (22-11) remain upbeat, understanding they can derail a juggernaut and earn their own bit of history today. Franklin, which had won 16 of 19 entering Friday, must win twice today to secure its first baseball championship and just the third team title in school history (with softball and track).St. Mary's (26-6) is attempting to become just the second large school in section history to three-peat, joining the Jeff Carlson-coached Elk Grove teams of 2005-07. The other significant dynasty run in D-I was compiled by Cordova and famed coach Guy Anderson with three titles in four seasons and four in seven in the 1980s. St. Mary's coach Pete Pijl has his program in the title series for the fifth time in six years.St. Mary's has fared well against Sacramento-area foes this season, with early nonleague wins over Rocklin (1-0) and Elk Grove (5-4). The Rams are 5-0 in this postseason, though Franklin held them to their lowest run total in that stretch.""I liked the way we battled,"" coach Kilby said, his brother addressing the team nearby. ""I like how our young team competed against a team like St. Mary's that starts only one junior, the pitcher. It was a tough ball in the sun, little things.""Kyle Zanzi tied it 2-2 in the Franklin third with a two-run triple to center field. The outfielder also showcased his cannon arm with throws to the plate.Franklin will start hard-throwing ace Josh Pigg (6-1) today at noon, with Game 3 to follow if necessary. Pigg has had some spectacular playoff moments this spring with wins over Pleasant Grove and Davis, ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, by The Bee entering the postseason.Confidence in Pigg? One could sense it in the faces of the Wildcats.""Absolutely,"" Kilby said. ""We're always confident, especially with Josh.

V"WASHINGTON  Michael Bromwich, the official put in charge of oil and gas regulation after the BP blowout last spring, gave a detailed public update Thursday about changes now under way, including new inspections, environmental reviews and ethical standards.The Deepwater Horizon tragedy has shaken government, and I hope industry, out of a complacency and overconfidence that had developed over the past several decades, Bromwich said. During that time, the increased dangers of deepwater drilling were not matched by increased vigilance and concern for the safety of those operations.The speech by the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement came two days after a presidential commission on the oil spill released its final report on the causes of the BP disaster and how to improve safety. The commission blamed government regulators and the industry for failing to address the risks of deepwater drilling and suggested a multitude of changes. Bromwich said his agency already had been working on many of them.A retreat on drilling safety is simply not an option, he said.Bromwich said afterward that the oil and gas industry was frustrated because new safety regulations were slowing down approvals for new activity in the Gulf of Mexico. He said his staff was talking to industry officials to explain the new rules and answer their questions. He said everyone he'd spoken with told him that the new rules made sense.Bromwich said he'd be stunned if we waited until the third or fourth quarter before issuing new deepwater drilling permits. He predicted that the pace would pick up but that it wouldn't match the very rapid processing of permits that industry groups would like to see restored.Many companies, trade groups and members of Congress have complained since last year, when the agency announced its new safety rules, that they don't know what's next for the permitting process.The implication is that we have other regulatory requirements up our sleeves that we have not yet unveiled, Bromwich said. This is simply not the case. Barring significant, unanticipated revelations from investigations into the root causes of the Deepwater Horizon explosion that remain in process, I do not anticipate further emergency rule-makings. Period.Still, future modifications will be needed to keep up with technology advances and with industry ambitions to drill in deeper water in geological formations that have greater pressures, he said.The technology associated with offshore drilling will continue to evolve, as will the complexities and risks of those operations, particularly in frontier environments, such as ultra-deepwater and the Arctic.Bromwich's new bureau is the temporary successor of the Minerals Management Service, an agency that was riddled with trouble because of its conflicting tasks: Promote offshore oil and gas development, enforce safety regulations and maximize revenues from oil and gas to the Treasury.A revenue collection branch was set up last year, and the agency is setting up new bureaus of energy management and safety and environmental enforcement that eventually will replace it.There will be a stronger role for environmental review and analysis in both new organizations, Bromwich said. The reviews must be done in a timely way but also based on a complete understanding of the potential environmental effects of those operations, he said.Bromwich also said his agency was recruiting experts to monitor deepwater drilling and was working on a training program for inspectors.He said that where the money would come from was still being worked out. Budget problems in Congress have stymied some of the changes, he said.The agency has instituted a new policy that requires employees in district offices to report any potential conflicts of interest. They must ask to be recused from inspecting facilities owned by companies they once worked for. They also must report any attempts at inappropriate influence or pressure.The rules could be difficult for district offices in the Gulf where offshore oil companies are the main employers, Bromwich acknowledged. However, he said he'd stick to the need for a clear boundary between regulators and the companies they oversee.The agency also plans to make sure that containment resources are immediately available in case of another blowout.Bromwich gave his speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington policy-research group.
