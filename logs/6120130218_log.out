  body: 'In the dim morning light, enormous vans from the agricultural hubs of California back precariously onto a sidewalk outside the San Francisco Ferry Building. From Yolo County, an older woman and her young assistant unload boxes of tomatoes that will attract a relentless stream of customers all day long. Across the way, a team from Watsonville arranges a colorful display of flowers on five folding tables that will sit nearly empty by market’s end. Next to them, three generations of a family from Petaluma pile their booth high with an assortment of root vegetables.Underneath an archway along the building’s front entrance, a lone man sorts through his modest wares. Tall and broad-shouldered, he removes three patio umbrellas from his white pickup truck and puts them on the ground to assemble later. Next follow two sensibly compact Ikea stools that hint at the hours of waiting to come. Soon he’ll unpack crates of rhubarbs, lemons, fresh eggs, dried pepper, tobacco — a slapdash assortment of products that will have to do until the warmer weather brings him his signature crop.The tan, balding man is David Winsberg, a peculiarity even in the world of independent farming. Most of his neighbors at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market this Saturday&nbsp;morning in early May have been awake for hours, some driving hundreds of miles from farms as large as 200 and 300 acres. Winsberg has zipped 32 miles up Highway 101 from East Palo Alto, where he runs a microfarm out of his backyard.Though the market doesn’t officially begin until 8 a.m., it’s already bustling. Joggers race by as some of San Francisco’s top chefs weave through the produce stands, looking to get their personal shopping out of the way early. Housewives and young couples trickle past Winsberg’s booth, picking up a pound or two of rhubarb for a pie or a crumble.Some stop by to say hello — it is only Winsberg’s second market this spring — and to &nbsp;inquire about his famous <em>pimientos de Padrón</em>.“When are the peppers coming in?” says Roger Shirakawa, a San Francisco real estate agent who has been a dedicated customer for several years.“Not for about six weeks.”“I have to wait that long?” Shirakawa counters with mock anger.“What do you mean ‘that long?’ That’s normal,” Winsberg says, laughing with a booming heartiness. “We just planted a whole bunch, actually, and they’re coming in nicely.”Winsberg asks Shirakawa about a hand surgery that he had last year, and they discuss the struggles of working out and staying in shape as they get older. After about five minutes, Shirakawa heads on his way, eager for the arrival of those little green veggies in a few weeks’ time. “His peppers are so unique,” Shirakawa tells a reporter standing nearby. “You can’t get them anywhere else.”For an interaction that has resulted in no exchange of money or goods, Winsberg has spent an awfully long time with Shirakawa. But harvesting that type of customer loyalty is just as essential for Winsberg and his business as the peppers that he grows. An unlikely farmer with the odds stacked against his success, he has carved a niche for himself over the years as “the pepper guy.”* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *Happy Quail Farms sits two blocks from the University Avenue exit of Highway 101, in the shadow of an Ikea superstore. From the front, it looks like all the other houses on this residential block in East Palo Alto. The backyard is something else entirely: It teems with squawking hens, a community of beehives, a 28,000-square-foot greenhouse and an exuberant family of Border-Aussie mixed breeds. Most of Winsberg’s crops are planted here and on a neighboring lot, an area totaling two acres.Established before East Palo Alto’s incorporation in 1983, the farm is a thread to a rich agricultural history in a community that has changed so much, particularly in the past three decades: a demographic shift from predominantly African-American to majority Latino; commercial development in the wake of the late ‘90s dot-com boom; revitalization efforts following years of record crime; and encroaching McMansions that have sprouted as new Silicon Valley millionaires emerge.East Palo Alto was founded in 1849 as Ravenswood, a port city meant to rival San Francisco. It was bypassed altogether by the transcontinental railroad and the land remained mostly undeveloped. In 1916, poultry farmer Charles Weeks bought hundreds of acres and started the Weeks Poultry Colony, which promised participants “a place of higher independence for man in his own garden home.” During the 1930s, many of these estates were turned into flower nurseries by Chinese, Italian and Japanese immigrants seeking cheap farmland in the Bay Area.Though it once drove the economy, little of this agricultural sector remains after decades of increasing urbanization, as well as competition from industrial farms and foreign imports.&nbsp;Today, Happy Quail is one of the only commercial farms on the Peninsula and Winsberg sees himself as fulfilling a historically important role — keeping alive what he jokingly refers to as “the original growth industry of the Silicon Valley.”But it was not a path that Winsberg imagined for himself growing up on a 600-acre pepper farm in south Florida. “I had no vision of anything close to this when I got started into my young, independent adulthood,” he says. “I didn’t know what I wanted to do.”Despite a childhood spent working alongside his father and 150 daily employees on their farm, Winsberg was rebelling against that path by the time he reached his teenage years. “I was never a Future Farmer of America,” he recalls of his high school experience. “Those were the total doofuses.”Though he enjoyed growing things, Winsberg did not like the tedium of farm work; his participation in the 4H Club had ended in disappointment, after his first cow sold to the local grocery store for pennies over expenses. As he got older, he began to resent having to give up free time for farm chores. “Usually, I would be stuck on something like sitting on the back of a machine, watching some little hole so it didn’t clog,” Winsberg says. “Not the most stimulating work.”Winsberg attended Earlham College in Indiana for a few semesters, then spent the next few years in a series of odd jobs, often for just weeks at a time. After working as a sewing machine mechanic for Wrangler Jeans, he toiled at a foundry in Wisconsin (“by the end of the week, I was coughing up just black stuff”) and then operated a hot press at a door factory. One summer, he grew tomatoes in rural North Carolina, but didn’t make much money.In 1978, Winsberg arrived in the Bay Area to join a friend’s glass-blowing studio in Berkeley, but quickly realized that the artistic life was not for him. Working as a baker in the former Bagel Works, he wound up in Palo Alto, where he began raising quail in the small backyard behind his apartment as a hobby and selling the eggs to local sushi bars. When Palo Alto began its farmers market in 1981, Winsberg would go each weekend to offer his quail by special order. (He wasn’t allowed to sell them live.)Though the quail weren’t particularly popular — he made more money growing a small patch of basil — a couple hundred dollars each week was enough to support Winsberg’s bachelor lifestyle. He quickly realized that this was a job he enjoyed. Unlike the farm in Florida, he could be his own boss, and there was an opportunity to interact with customers. “It’s very self-satisfying,” Winsberg says, “in that you feel like you’re doing something appreciated.”At the time, Winsberg was working retail at an outdoor clothing store, and it gave him the impetus to branch out on his own. “I thought, ‘You know, I could probably run my own business without that much trouble,’” he remembers. “I could certainly lose money as well anybody else. And I just was fed up with watching other people.”By now married, Winsberg searched for land to farm in the Bay Area. In East Palo Alto, he found a community of retired Japanese flower farmers who would lease him space in their old greenhouses on a month-by-month basis. Back then, the newly incorporated city still had strong remnants of its agricultural beginnings; down the street, people in the neighborhood were raising pig and sheep.Winsberg’s original landlord, Ichiro Taro Tanaka, or “Mr. Ichi,” acted as a sort of mentor. Tanaka’s son and daughter had become a computer programmer and a dental hygienist, respectively, so Winsberg was the first person with whom he could share his wisdom and experience. They became good friends, and when Tanaka died of colon cancer a few years later, his wife sold the property to Winsberg, who still lives there.Now a flourishing business, Happy Quail is the sole farm on a residential street with schools at either end. While other small growers nearby have died off or been chased away by rising property costs, Winsberg has been fortunate to expand over the last 30 years. “It was a very synchronistic connection,” he says. “Just as I got started farming, there was this explosion of farmer’s markets and awareness of people about local and organic.”“This couldn’t happen in other places very easily,” Winsberg adds. He recognizes that he has a survived because of a unique combination of circumstances, including the particularly receptive environment of the Bay Area. “This is sort of a gourmet ghetto here,” he says. “We have a lot of chefs that not only want quality products, but also understand the small farm dilemma… A lot of it is luck.”* &nbsp;*&nbsp; *It’s the week before a market, and Winsberg is inside the decades-old chicken coop that has been converted to his workshop. The dark, dusty room is stuffed with gardening supplies and trays of brown paper bags piled all the way to the low ceiling, leaving only a small space near the entrance for work. But it doesn’t matter, because this, as usual, is a solo operation: Winsberg is busy packing one-pound bags of tobacco in preparation for sale in a few days.“Tobacco kind of gets a bad rap,” he says, weighing a package and then adding a few more dried leaves. “Everyone just says it’s a death drug — and I think cigarettes are certainly a death drug — but tobacco has other uses in society, in the garden, you name it, that aren’t harmful.”Winsberg has been growing “ceremonial tobacco,” as he calls it, for several years. Recently he has been bringing with it him to farmers markets, to see if it can become another staple. Going around the big tobacco companies has been a source of excitement, Winsberg says, and he refers to the venture his “own little revolution.” Though not extremely popular yet, he might sell up to $100 worth of tobacco in a given weekend, and he’s providing it to a smoke shop in Palo Alto. As a small farmer, Winsberg has to look for products that allow him to be “a big fish in a small pond,” and he hopes that, within the next few years, the tobacco will become a specialty item for which he is known and sought out.That has been the secret of his success. By becoming a “one-stop pepper shop,” often with products that cannot be found in your local grocery store, Winsberg has carved out a niche in the Bay Area and around the country. (In 2009, he even had some of his peppers appear at one of President Obama’s inaugural celebrations.) But like any small businessman, he initially struggled to establish a presence, and the limited scope of his enterprise still presents considerable challenges in keeping Happy Quail Farms running smoothly.Though they now comprise about half his business, and have garnered him national attention, Winsberg has only been selling <em>Padrón</em> peppers for the last decade. Before that, he spent years experimenting with “fifty or a hundred different things,” including eight types of mint (no one knew what to do with it), half a dozen kinds of thyme, tarragon, and tomatoes (it wasn’t a unique enough product to be profitable). Because of his childhood experiences, Winsberg initially resisted the idea of growing peppers, but after noticing that they were not heavily represented at farmers markets, he decided to try planting bell peppers.At first, only the red and yellow variety sold. But a growing interest in locally grown product and new farmers markets, including the one at the Ferry Plaza, in the early ‘90s led Winsberg to expand with an increasing number of different colors and specialty strains.“There’s a lot of unusual peppers,” he says, “We have such a large, diverse clientele that I can sell Russian and Hungarian and Peruvian and Spanish and all these different ethnic types very effectively here, and people are interested in them.”However, the real explosion came in 2001, following Calvin Trillin’s article on <em>Padrónes</em> in Gourmet magazine. It was a lucky break for Winsberg, who had just started growing the strand after a friend brought him back a packet of seeds from a trip to the region of Galicia in Spain. Looking for customers, Winsberg sent boxes of the peppers, normally served as appetizers, to local chefs, most of whom had no idea what to do with them. But as the demand for Spanish tapas grew, so did the interest in Winsberg’s peppers, and his reach spread with word of mouth among chefs.In addition to selling at farmers markets throughout the Bay Area, Winsberg supplies restaurants up and down the West Coast, as well as in places like Boston, Hoboken, N.J., Las Vegas and Santa Fe, N.M. &nbsp;“We’re sort of coasting now on our fame,” he jokes.* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *The <em>Padrón</em> peppers have given Happy Quail a more established place in the market, but even after 30 years, there are lessons to be learned. “Farming is not a science,” Winsberg says. “It’s a bit of an art and a bit of a gamble as to what works.” He still faces regular threats from competition, the elements, and even the community where he has been based for three decades.“Part of the trouble for a small farm is just to get enough return per square foot to survive,” Winsberg says. He has had to get creative at times, especially given the limited amount of space he has for planting. Like the titans of technology that surround him, Winsberg is often giving innovative methods a shot, infusing the ancient profession with modern flourishes to stay ahead of the curve.With only two acres, Winsberg cannot afford to let any of his land lie fallow from year to year, but using chemical fertilizers creates the risk of contamination in the runoff water. He has taken to exploring natural microbial additives to augment soil nutrients. This year, an Italian company sent him a new, undisclosed mixture to test which is meant to increase humic acid production.“There’s a little bit of chemistry,” Winsberg says. “There’s a little a bit of witchcraft.”Trying out potential new crops under such restrictions is a gamble, because it is unclear whether giving up space for an unproven product will be a worthwhile investment. Winsberg is growing strawberries for the first time, though instead of planting them in the ground, he has crafted vertical planters out of PVC pipe which he can then lean against the wall of his greenhouse. It is a crafty solution based on an idea he found on the Internet.Still, the greatest tool for any small farmer is good old-fashioned customer loyalty. As an experiment this spring, Winsberg did something sort of crazy in the world of see-it, feel-it, take-it-home vegetable shopping: he sold “pepper futures” online, offering the first 20 pounds of <em>Padrónes</em> from this year’s crop for pre-sale through his website. And the even crazier part? They sold out almost immediately.“We basically have gotten a reputation out of consistency,” Winsberg says. “We do have people lining up for our peppers.” He cites his prime location in East Palo Alto, which is closely matched to the moderate coastal climate of the <em>Padrónes’</em> native Galicia. The small size of Happy Quail also allows Winsberg to devote more individual attention to the specialty peppers he grows, and ward off recent competition from bigger farms that can afford to undersell him by several dollars on the pound.How much longer a model like his can last, however, is a serious question for Winsberg. He doesn’t see much of a future for farms like his. “When I get to the stage where I can’t do it any more, I think [my farm] would just be sold to real estate to be developed as a residential plot,” he says.His place in the community was threatened once before, more than a decade ago, during the construction of the massive shopping center a block away. And the relentless march of progress leaves Happy Quail Farms ever further at odds with a modernizing city. Although East Palo Alto’s planning commission remains fairly supportive of Winsberg’s presence, a neighbor’s recent complaints about the constant crowing of his roosters—the first time in more than 30 years, he says—only serves to highlight how the city’s changes have left him behind.“I think farming is on its way out of the Bay Area,” Winsberg notes. “And it’s too bad, because the great advantage for me is being right here in my market. … I feel kind of sad to see it all getting converted into asphalt and houses.”Until then, he’s here to be your pepper guy.',

  body: '<strong>QUESTION: I read years ago that ethanol plants needed to be subsidized in order to make “ends meet.” Since then, how much has the efficiency of ethanol-producing technology improved? Is the industry now getting more energy out of the ethanol produced than put in? How dependent is this efficiency on the type of biofuel used (corn, grass, sugar cane)?</strong> <em>Asked by Hector Raynal, El Paso, Texas</em><a rel="attachment wp-att-6651" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/21/led-bulbs-are-the-best-lighting-choice/penipress-top_stanford-sage-logo_large-2/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6651" title="PeniPress Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PeniPress-Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large1-1024x249.png" alt="" height="107" width="442"></a><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The United States&nbsp;loves corn. We use it for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornproducts.com/" target="_blank">everything</a>, from Coca-Cola sweetener to cow feed to “plastic” cup base. And we grow a lot of it: about 730 billion pounds in 2010*. On par with America’s love for corn is its oil addiction—and over the past 10 years we have combined these two great infatuations in the form of ethanol, a biofuel that can be mixed with gasoline to power cars and trucks. While the process of making corn ethanol involves simple fermentation and distillation—not unlike making whisky or vodka—the impacts of moving nearly 126 billion pounds of corn off the table and into the tank are enormous, and infinitely more complex.Corn, like any plant, needs sunlight, soil and water to grow. In the United States, it gets myriad additional inputs: in 2005, farmers applied 10 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer to our nation’s corn, irrigated more than 80 percent of the cropland and sprayed about 170 million pounds of herbicides—and that’s while the plants were still in the field. Once the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen" target="_blank">Little Red Hen</a> is ready to harvest all of that corn, it needs to be picked, packaged and shipped off for processing and distribution.Every step in that process requires energy. The question is, can we get more energy&nbsp;<em>out</em> of corn ethanol that we have to put&nbsp;<em>in</em>? This is the&nbsp;<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/biofuels/biofuels-interactive" target="_blank">energy output ratio</a> you’re asking about. If the Hen sends the corn to be made into biofuel, she will get about 1.3 units of biofuel energy out for every unit of fossil fuel energy in. And unfortunately, that’s the lowest energy ratio out there for biofuels. For comparison, Brazil—the world’s second largest biofuels producer after the United States—gets an output ratio of 2 from their sugar cane ethanol. Also, studies on net energy output of biofuels are convoluted and often hard to sift through: while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1552355771656v0/" target="_blank">some</a> say it takes more energy to produce biofuels than the fuel provides,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf" target="_blank">others</a> say just the opposite. We’ll attempt to clarify the situation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html">Nitty Gritty</a>.While energy ratios give a valuable metric for comparison, judging the impacts of biofuels—and their ultimate value as a sustainable fuel source—is more complex than comparing energy outputs or piecing together&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201103/impact/essential.html">lifecycle analyses</a>. Corn ethanol has environmental, economic and social impacts that reach far beyond the gas tank. And by almost any analysis, those impacts make it a poor choice for fuel in the United States.One such negative impact is diverting corn from food to fuel: the 14 million acres of corn we used for biofuels in 2008 could have fed 26&nbsp;million cows to maturity, or have sustained as many as 100 million people for a year. Further, choosing to use that corn for fuel decreased the amount available as food on the international market and may have contributed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/ethanol_mandates_may_spike_food_prices_economists_warn" target="_blank">skyrocketing food prices</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=biofuels-bad-for-people-and-climate" target="_blank">increasing deforestation</a> rates in the Amazon.So with all of the harmful side effects, why doesn’t the Red Hen just keep the corn on the table and out of the tank? Even characters in fables are susceptible to economic incentives, evidently. With the help of decades of farm subsidies keeping inputs cheap, a tariff on foreign ethanol, 40 percent of production costs being covered by tax dollars, and government mandates for production, sending corn to the tank earns famers a lot more money. Is that really our primary goal from an alternative fuel source? Almost certainly not, so lets look elsewhere for fuel and leave the corn for the cola and cows.<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html"><strong>READ MORE: Life cycle assessments capture more of corn ethanol’s overarching impacts [Click through for the Nitty Gritty Answer]. </strong></a><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-5770" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/08/which-is-more-eco-friendly-real-or-artificial-christmas-trees/ask-sage-button/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="Ask SAGE button" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ask-SAGE-button.png" alt="" height="73" width="300"></a></strong>&nbsp;',

  body: '<strong>QUESTION: I read years ago that ethanol plants needed to be subsidized in order to make “ends meet.” Since then, how much has the efficiency of ethanol-producing technology improved? Is the industry now getting more energy out of the ethanol produced than put in? How dependent is this efficiency on the type of biofuel used (corn, grass, sugar cane)?</strong> <em>Asked by Hector Raynal, El Paso, Texas</em><a rel="attachment wp-att-6651" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/21/led-bulbs-are-the-best-lighting-choice/penipress-top_stanford-sage-logo_large-2/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6651" title="PeniPress Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PeniPress-Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large1-1024x249.png" alt="" height="107" width="442"></a><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The United States&nbsp;loves corn. We use it for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornproducts.com/" target="_blank">everything</a>, from Coca-Cola sweetener to cow feed to “plastic” cup base. And we grow a lot of it: about 730 billion pounds in 2010*. On par with America’s love for corn is its oil addiction—and over the past 10 years we have combined these two great infatuations in the form of ethanol, a biofuel that can be mixed with gasoline to power cars and trucks. While the process of making corn ethanol involves simple fermentation and distillation—not unlike making whisky or vodka—the impacts of moving nearly 126 billion pounds of corn off the table and into the tank are enormous, and infinitely more complex.Corn, like any plant, needs sunlight, soil and water to grow. In the United States, it gets myriad additional inputs: in 2005, farmers applied 10 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer to our nation’s corn, irrigated more than 80 percent of the cropland and sprayed about 170 million pounds of herbicides—and that’s while the plants were still in the field. Once the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen" target="_blank">Little Red Hen</a> is ready to harvest all of that corn, it needs to be picked, packaged and shipped off for processing and distribution.Every step in that process requires energy. The question is, can we get more energy&nbsp;<em>out</em> of corn ethanol that we have to put&nbsp;<em>in</em>? This is the&nbsp;<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/biofuels/biofuels-interactive" target="_blank">energy output ratio</a> you’re asking about. If the Hen sends the corn to be made into biofuel, she will get about 1.3 units of biofuel energy out for every unit of fossil fuel energy in. And unfortunately, that’s the lowest energy ratio out there for biofuels. For comparison, Brazil—the world’s second largest biofuels producer after the United States—gets an output ratio of 2 from their sugar cane ethanol. Also, studies on net energy output of biofuels are convoluted and often hard to sift through: while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1552355771656v0/" target="_blank">some</a> say it takes more energy to produce biofuels than the fuel provides,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf" target="_blank">others</a> say just the opposite. We’ll attempt to clarify the situation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html">Nitty Gritty</a>.While energy ratios give a valuable metric for comparison, judging the impacts of biofuels—and their ultimate value as a sustainable fuel source—is more complex than comparing energy outputs or piecing together&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201103/impact/essential.html">lifecycle analyses</a>. Corn ethanol has environmental, economic and social impacts that reach far beyond the gas tank. And by almost any analysis, those impacts make it a poor choice for fuel in the United States.One such negative impact is diverting corn from food to fuel: the 14 million acres of corn we used for biofuels in 2008 could have fed 26&nbsp;million cows to maturity, or have sustained as many as 100 million people for a year. Further, choosing to use that corn for fuel decreased the amount available as food on the international market and may have contributed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/ethanol_mandates_may_spike_food_prices_economists_warn" target="_blank">skyrocketing food prices</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=biofuels-bad-for-people-and-climate" target="_blank">increasing deforestation</a> rates in the Amazon.So with all of the harmful side effects, why doesn’t the Red Hen just keep the corn on the table and out of the tank? Even characters in fables are susceptible to economic incentives, evidently. With the help of decades of farm subsidies keeping inputs cheap, a tariff on foreign ethanol, 40 percent of production costs being covered by tax dollars, and government mandates for production, sending corn to the tank earns famers a lot more money. Is that really our primary goal from an alternative fuel source? Almost certainly not, so lets look elsewhere for fuel and leave the corn for the cola and cows.<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html"><strong>READ MORE: Life cycle assessments capture more of corn ethanol’s overarching impacts [Click through for the Nitty Gritty Answer]. </strong></a><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-5770" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/08/which-is-more-eco-friendly-real-or-artificial-christmas-trees/ask-sage-button/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="Ask SAGE button" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ask-SAGE-button.png" alt="" height="73" width="300"></a></strong>&nbsp;',

  body: '<strong>QUESTION: I read years ago that ethanol plants needed to be subsidized in order to make “ends meet.” Since then, how much has the efficiency of ethanol-producing technology improved? Is the industry now getting more energy out of the ethanol produced than put in? How dependent is this efficiency on the type of biofuel used (corn, grass, sugar cane)?</strong> <em>Asked by Hector Raynal, El Paso, Texas</em><a rel="attachment wp-att-6651" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/21/led-bulbs-are-the-best-lighting-choice/penipress-top_stanford-sage-logo_large-2/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6651" title="PeniPress Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PeniPress-Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large1-1024x249.png" alt="" height="107" width="442"></a><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The United States&nbsp;loves corn. We use it for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornproducts.com/" target="_blank">everything</a>, from Coca-Cola sweetener to cow feed to “plastic” cup base. And we grow a lot of it: about 730 billion pounds in 2010*. On par with America’s love for corn is its oil addiction—and over the past 10 years we have combined these two great infatuations in the form of ethanol, a biofuel that can be mixed with gasoline to power cars and trucks. While the process of making corn ethanol involves simple fermentation and distillation—not unlike making whisky or vodka—the impacts of moving nearly 126 billion pounds of corn off the table and into the tank are enormous, and infinitely more complex.Corn, like any plant, needs sunlight, soil and water to grow. In the United States, it gets myriad additional inputs: in 2005, farmers applied 10 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer to our nation’s corn, irrigated more than 80 percent of the cropland and sprayed about 170 million pounds of herbicides—and that’s while the plants were still in the field. Once the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen" target="_blank">Little Red Hen</a> is ready to harvest all of that corn, it needs to be picked, packaged and shipped off for processing and distribution.Every step in that process requires energy. The question is, can we get more energy&nbsp;<em>out</em> of corn ethanol that we have to put&nbsp;<em>in</em>? This is the&nbsp;<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/biofuels/biofuels-interactive" target="_blank">energy output ratio</a> you’re asking about. If the Hen sends the corn to be made into biofuel, she will get about 1.3 units of biofuel energy out for every unit of fossil fuel energy in. And unfortunately, that’s the lowest energy ratio out there for biofuels. For comparison, Brazil—the world’s second largest biofuels producer after the United States—gets an output ratio of 2 from their sugar cane ethanol. Also, studies on net energy output of biofuels are convoluted and often hard to sift through: while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1552355771656v0/" target="_blank">some</a> say it takes more energy to produce biofuels than the fuel provides,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf" target="_blank">others</a> say just the opposite. We’ll attempt to clarify the situation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html">Nitty Gritty</a>.While energy ratios give a valuable metric for comparison, judging the impacts of biofuels—and their ultimate value as a sustainable fuel source—is more complex than comparing energy outputs or piecing together&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201103/impact/essential.html">lifecycle analyses</a>. Corn ethanol has environmental, economic and social impacts that reach far beyond the gas tank. And by almost any analysis, those impacts make it a poor choice for fuel in the United States.One such negative impact is diverting corn from food to fuel: the 14 million acres of corn we used for biofuels in 2008 could have fed 26&nbsp;million cows to maturity, or have sustained as many as 100 million people for a year. Further, choosing to use that corn for fuel decreased the amount available as food on the international market and may have contributed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/ethanol_mandates_may_spike_food_prices_economists_warn" target="_blank">skyrocketing food prices</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=biofuels-bad-for-people-and-climate" target="_blank">increasing deforestation</a> rates in the Amazon.So with all of the harmful side effects, why doesn’t the Red Hen just keep the corn on the table and out of the tank? Even characters in fables are susceptible to economic incentives, evidently. With the help of decades of farm subsidies keeping inputs cheap, a tariff on foreign ethanol, 40 percent of production costs being covered by tax dollars, and government mandates for production, sending corn to the tank earns famers a lot more money. Is that really our primary goal from an alternative fuel source? Almost certainly not, so lets look elsewhere for fuel and leave the corn for the cola and cows.<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html"><strong>READ MORE: Life cycle assessments capture more of corn ethanol’s overarching impacts [Click through for the Nitty Gritty Answer]. </strong></a><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-5770" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/08/which-is-more-eco-friendly-real-or-artificial-christmas-trees/ask-sage-button/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="Ask SAGE button" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ask-SAGE-button.png" alt="" height="73" width="300"></a></strong>&nbsp;',

  body: '<em>Related News: <a href="http://www.penipress.com/2011/02/16/tesla-motors-increases-revenues-and-prepares-to-launch-a-new-sedan-next-year/" target="_blank">Tesla Motors increases revenues and prepares to launch new sedan next year</a></em>Flash back to Nov. 19, 2008: the chief executive officers of the three major American automotive manufacturers were testifying in front of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services when Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-New York) asked why each executive thought it was necessary to fly to Washington in his own private jet.“Couldn’t you all have downgraded to first class or jet pooled or something to get here?” he asked the executives, who were in Washington to request federal funding to save their companies.Such perks are common at the General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM), The Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) and the Chrysler Group, LLC. The United States’ three remaining legacy automotive manufacturers, have long-standing traditions of more traditional executive pay structures with extra benefits such as the use of corporate jets. &nbsp;In contrast, Palo Alto based electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which likes to bill its executive team as a blending of the best of both the automotive and the technology industries, holds to a less traditional philosophy when it comes to perks and pay.Tesla’s prospectus, published in January 2010, outlines its executive compensation structure. The differences are &nbsp;substantial when compared to the company’s counterparts in Detroit.With less than 2,000 Tesla vehicles on the road as of this month, Tesla remains a much smaller company when compared to its competitors in the automotive industry. On average, both Ford and General Motors sell over 2,000 cars in a single business day.Tesla claims that its philosophy when it comes to executive compensation pays homage to its roots as a technology startup.Camille Ricketts, communications manager for Tesla Motors, wrote in an email, “One of Tesla’s goals is to bring Silicon Valley tech culture to the automotive industry.”This is no more evident than with the 2009 compensation package for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, 39, who accepted just $1 from &nbsp;a state-mandated minimum of $33,280 in cash compensation each year since becoming CEO in 2008. However, that’s only part of the picture. In 2009, Musk, who gained success and notoriety as one of the founders of PayPal, Inc., was also awarded 10 million shares in stock options worth $2.21 per share, which works out to over $23.8 million.Other Tesla executives receive salaries that are often less than a third of what their counterparts in Detroit are paid. When it comes to &nbsp;benefits , executives at Tesla are &nbsp;afforded the same benefits given to all employees at Tesla, such as health insurance and a retirement plan.While the major automotive makers have seemingly recovered from the brink of bankruptcy in 2008 but struggle to rebound, executive officers for companies like Ford and General Motors still offer salaries in the millions. Former General Motors Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner, for example, earned a salary over $1.5 million in 2007. In addition, executives at the major automotive manufacturers have been offered additional perks not limited to discounted or free automobiles and use of a private corporate jet as a part of their compensation packages. Beyond his salary, Wagner’s 2007 benefits package was estimated to be worth $697,358.According to its 2010 proxy statement, executives at Ford, which did not accept loans from the federal government, are still afforded similar benefits.Musk’s counterpart at Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally, took a pay cut in dealing with his company’s financial short comings, &nbsp;but he still earned a base salary of over $1 million last year for his services. For 2009, Mulally’s net compensation &nbsp;was estimated to be &nbsp;nearly $18 million including $1.4 million in salary, $10.9 million in stock awards and $5 million in stock options. While Ford does have a bonus structure in place for executives, Mulally did not receive a bonus in 2009.In addition, Mulally was allotted use of two vehicles and Ford &nbsp;provided him with housing. Ford allows their top executives use of the company jet for both personal and private matters as a matter of security. All together, Ford estimated these benefits &nbsp;were worth $491,869 in 2009.In its proxy statement, Ford notes that &nbsp;the company’s philosophy on corporate compensation is based on pay structures comparable to other Fortune 100 companies. The statement stipulates that Ford targets companies of a similar size and business model to their own to create a peer group. In 2010, Palo Alto based computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ) was a part of this group, which also included 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) among other top American companies.A representative from Ford declined to comment on how the company establishes its executive pay structures.Tesla has yet to turn a profit.&nbsp; In its most recent earnings report announced Feb. 15, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $51.3 million. Tesla cites an emphasis on research and development as the company moves towards the release of the Model S next year as the reasons for the losses.The company has purchased the former NUMMI plant in Fremont and is currently refitting the factory for electric vehicle production. In a press conference at the plant last October, Musk said, “We really want to stay on the forefront of innovation as far as electric vehicles are concerned and continue to serve as a catalyst for the transition to a sustainable energy future.”Currently, Tesla’s only model, $109,000 Roadster, is assembled in Menlo Park from parts produced as far away as Europe.At the moment, it is unclear whether Tesla’s increase in production will change its executive compensation structures, but Tesla projects that by 2013, the company will be producing about 20,000 cars a year. That dwarfs its current output significantly and has the potential to establish a fundamental change in its culture and business model, emphasizing production as opposed to product development.Ricketts emphasized the unique nature of Tesla’s corporate structure saying, “To facilitate open communication and a democratic environment, Tesla’s headquarters has a very open floor plan without high cubicle walls, where teams work in close, collaborative proximity — just like at many tech startups.”She added, “Tesla is about nimble innovation, not bureaucracy, and everything about how teams are structured and led drives toward that focus.”',

  body: '<strong>QUESTION: I read years ago that ethanol plants needed to be subsidized in order to make “ends meet.” Since then, how much has the efficiency of ethanol-producing technology improved? Is the industry now getting more energy out of the ethanol produced than put in? How dependent is this efficiency on the type of biofuel used (corn, grass, sugar cane)?</strong> <em>Asked by Hector Raynal, El Paso, Texas</em><a rel="attachment wp-att-6651" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/21/led-bulbs-are-the-best-lighting-choice/penipress-top_stanford-sage-logo_large-2/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6651" title="PeniPress Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/PeniPress-Top_Stanford-SAGE-logo_large1-1024x249.png" alt="" height="107" width="442"></a><strong>ANSWER: </strong>The United States&nbsp;loves corn. We use it for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cornproducts.com/" target="_blank">everything</a>, from Coca-Cola sweetener to cow feed to “plastic” cup base. And we grow a lot of it: about 730 billion pounds in 2010*. On par with America’s love for corn is its oil addiction—and over the past 10 years we have combined these two great infatuations in the form of ethanol, a biofuel that can be mixed with gasoline to power cars and trucks. While the process of making corn ethanol involves simple fermentation and distillation—not unlike making whisky or vodka—the impacts of moving nearly 126 billion pounds of corn off the table and into the tank are enormous, and infinitely more complex.Corn, like any plant, needs sunlight, soil and water to grow. In the United States, it gets myriad additional inputs: in 2005, farmers applied 10 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer to our nation’s corn, irrigated more than 80 percent of the cropland and sprayed about 170 million pounds of herbicides—and that’s while the plants were still in the field. Once the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen" target="_blank">Little Red Hen</a> is ready to harvest all of that corn, it needs to be picked, packaged and shipped off for processing and distribution.Every step in that process requires energy. The question is, can we get more energy&nbsp;<em>out</em> of corn ethanol that we have to put&nbsp;<em>in</em>? This is the&nbsp;<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/10/biofuels/biofuels-interactive" target="_blank">energy output ratio</a> you’re asking about. If the Hen sends the corn to be made into biofuel, she will get about 1.3 units of biofuel energy out for every unit of fossil fuel energy in. And unfortunately, that’s the lowest energy ratio out there for biofuels. For comparison, Brazil—the world’s second largest biofuels producer after the United States—gets an output ratio of 2 from their sugar cane ethanol. Also, studies on net energy output of biofuels are convoluted and often hard to sift through: while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1552355771656v0/" target="_blank">some</a> say it takes more energy to produce biofuels than the fuel provides,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/AF/265.pdf" target="_blank">others</a> say just the opposite. We’ll attempt to clarify the situation in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html">Nitty Gritty</a>.While energy ratios give a valuable metric for comparison, judging the impacts of biofuels—and their ultimate value as a sustainable fuel source—is more complex than comparing energy outputs or piecing together&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201103/impact/essential.html">lifecycle analyses</a>. Corn ethanol has environmental, economic and social impacts that reach far beyond the gas tank. And by almost any analysis, those impacts make it a poor choice for fuel in the United States.One such negative impact is diverting corn from food to fuel: the 14 million acres of corn we used for biofuels in 2008 could have fed 26&nbsp;million cows to maturity, or have sustained as many as 100 million people for a year. Further, choosing to use that corn for fuel decreased the amount available as food on the international market and may have contributed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science20.com/news_articles/ethanol_mandates_may_spike_food_prices_economists_warn" target="_blank">skyrocketing food prices</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=biofuels-bad-for-people-and-climate" target="_blank">increasing deforestation</a> rates in the Amazon.So with all of the harmful side effects, why doesn’t the Red Hen just keep the corn on the table and out of the tank? Even characters in fables are susceptible to economic incentives, evidently. With the help of decades of farm subsidies keeping inputs cheap, a tariff on foreign ethanol, 40 percent of production costs being covered by tax dollars, and government mandates for production, sending corn to the tank earns famers a lot more money. Is that really our primary goal from an alternative fuel source? Almost certainly not, so lets look elsewhere for fuel and leave the corn for the cola and cows.<a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/sage/201104/biofuels/nittygritty.html"><strong>READ MORE: Life cycle assessments capture more of corn ethanol’s overarching impacts [Click through for the Nitty Gritty Answer]. </strong></a><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-5770" href="http://www.penipress.com/2010/12/08/which-is-more-eco-friendly-real-or-artificial-christmas-trees/ask-sage-button/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" title="Ask SAGE button" src="http://www.penipress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ask-SAGE-button.png" alt="" height="73" width="300"></a></strong>&nbsp;',

  body: 'An estimated 100,000 people will die this year from adverse reactions to drugs. Millions of others, the Department of Energy Human Genome Project warns, will experience dangerous or uncomfortable affects from such reactions.This year, anti-depressants will cause some patients nervous system degradation; painkillers administered to mothers after childbirth will poison some infants with morphine; 6,000 individuals inflicted with stroke, who would have otherwise survived, will die from receiving an incorrect dose of warfarin, the drug used to break down blood clots.<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18377" title="Screen shot 2012-03-28 at 11.59.05 PM" src="http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-28-at-11.59.05-PM.png" alt="" height="97" width="225">More and more present-day case studies tell us that the one-size-fits-all approach that has defined much of medicine’s past will not be the way of its future.The relationship between drugs and genes continues to serve as a potent catalyst in the medical profession, spurring researchers and health professionals to explore an emerging wave in healthcare: personalized medicine.The field of personalized medicine is often defined as giving the right drug to the right patient at the right dose at the right time. It is evolving most quickly in the United States. &nbsp;Silicon Valley and Boston are international hotspots of innovation, according to Chunlin Wang, a researcher at the Stanford Genome Technology Center.Analysts agree that Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX), a Redwood City based diagnostics company founded in 2000, has positioned itself as a global leader in personalized medicine, specifically in cancer diagnostics.The company’s president and chief executive officer Kim Popovits, said the adoption of personalized medicine in clinical settings calls for a fundamental shift from a therapeutics-based medical system to one rooted in diagnostics and prevention through analysis of genomic data.Many Americans may not be familiar with the term “personalized medicine,” according to Ron Leuty, a biotech reporter at the San Francisco Business Times. But many say it is a field that dates back to prehistory. For Baback Gharizadeh, a researcher at SGTC, personalized medicine refers not only to pharmaceuticals, but to food: determining diet based on individuals’ specific physical and mental conditions, for example, was a common practice in ancient Hindu and Aztec societies.The successful completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 forged new paths for personalized care. According to Ron Davis, director of the SGTC, the 13-year project gave rise to next generation sequencing, the fastest, most advanced and most comprehensive sequencing technique used by scientists today. Over the course of the project, the cost of sequencing the genome decreased 10 million-fold.Personalized medicine is “just starting,” Davis said. In an interview at his office at the technology center’s campus, just minutes from Stanford’s main campus, he described a future world in which babies’ genomes will be fully sequenced at birth, and adults will attach diagnostic devices to their skin to monitor vitals and take real-time assays, sending alerts to a doctor when needed; if someone were about to have a heart attack, such a device would send a text message with a message such as, “Go to the emergency room immediately. You’re going to have a heart attack.”Most labs in the United States currently rely on PCR, the predecessor to next generation sequencing, to produce commercial diagnostic tests. Diagnostic companies like Genomic Health are eager to apply next generation sequencing technology for new medical applications. The first of this month marked the official launch date of a Genomic Health’s new company-owned research subsidiary dedicated to this newest sequencing method.Randy Scott, chief executive officer of the subsidiary and a founding member of Genomic Health, described the subsidiary as reflective of a “turning point” in the history of medicine.“This is a great opportunity to bring this new genomic technology, knowledge and expertise broadly to the medical community, much like we did in cancer with our core business,” he said. “Investment we’ve made over the past several years in the development of a robust next-generation sequencing platform, and the capabilities we have established in building a successful cancer genomics business, make this the ideal time for Genomic Health to expand into both common and rare genetic conditions.”Genomic Health has shown a keen interest in remaining ahead on the sequencing curve. Leuty described Genomic Health’s key advantage as an “ability to look out into the future.” Since its inception it has demonstrated an ability to innovate in-house and to be the first to make its tests commercial.Applying its approach within cancer diagnostics to diseases in areas such as immunology, neurology and cardiology could take the company far. Genomic Health’s persistence in pushing its breast cancer diagnostic test seven years ago in a market that was decades behind its vision suggest that the company could be fearless enough to bring new changes that medicine doesn’t know it is ready for.Yet the challenges facing Genomic Health and other life science companies trying to bring diagnostic tests to clinics are considerable.Popovits said that Genomic Health’s two greatest challenges in expanding the scope of its diagnostics are obtaining reimbursement for tests from governments, insurance companies and payers, and navigating regulatory processes.Davis also outlined problems associated with data management. Sequencing technology is evolving faster than the computers available to process the data. This leaves biotechnology firms struggling to find ways to store and analyze the massive data sets generated by next generation labs.Leuty drew comparisons between the current state of bioinformatics technology to the early stages of the personal computer industry.“In a couple years, there will be a big player in gene sequencing analysis, and they’ll be the new Oracles of this world,” Leuty said.What’s more, integrating genomic analysis smoothly into clinical diagnostic settings and medical school curricula is another obstacle, Davis said, as physicians and rising professionals will need training in making new biostatical tests and results part of their practices.Among patients, Leuty said, there seems to be a prevailing concern about the privacy of individuals’ medical information. Many worry that if not fully protected, such information regarding genetic traits or predispositions could at some point impact their health insurance or work opportunities.According to Stuart Kim, Stanford School of Medicine professor of genetics and developmental biology, rather than approaching medicine by “putting out fires,” personalized medicine opens the door for everyday people to make better decisions about their health.“Right now, everybody is saying, ‘I’m going to invest equally in diet, and exercise and going to get a check up on this and the other thing,’ when really, they’re at much more risk for certain things than for others,” Kim said. “So if I had the knowledge, I could be smarter about what I concentrated on. And that would make me, overall, healthier. It’s preventative.”<strong>Genomic Health rumored as potential acquisition</strong>Expanding genomic analysis and diagnostic companies aren’t escaping the attention of big time pharmaceutical and medical-device companies. In mid-February, the pharmaceutical giant Roche &nbsp;put forth a hostile bid for Illumina, a San Diego-based firm which Gharizadeh referred to as the global leader in next generation sequencing machines.Some analysts &nbsp;expect 2012 to be a year of mergers and acquisition activity involving diagnostic companies, and Roche’s bid intimates the company’s growing interest in the diagnostics field.GE, the world’s largest producer of medical imaging equipment, and Siemens, Europe’s largest engineering company, have both expressed increased interest in next generation sequencing and focusing more on molecular-based medicines.Analysts have described Genomic Health and Affymetrix, a Santa Clara-based cancer diagnostics company, as potential acquisition candidates.“They (Genomic Health) would be attractive, but there would be a huge premium for the acquirer to pay because of the intellectual property and the person power with Randy Scott, Kim Popovits and everyone on the clinical end of things,” Leuty said about the prospect of a take over.The company’s upcoming expenses on further research and development could also present a barrier to companies considering an acquisition &nbsp;Genomic Health reported on its last earnings report that it could see zero profit in 2012, as $20 million &nbsp;will be invested in the new subsidiary over the next two years. The company’s public relations manager Victoria Steiner said &nbsp;in an email that the company has a policy declining to comment on takeover speculation.Genomic Health currently holds $830 million in assets and is expected to increase revenue by 61 percent in the next three years, according to Bloomberg data.The company &nbsp;receives orders for its diagnostic tests in over 60 countries. It has reached over 200,000 patients since its founding out of a total of about 1.2 million potentially patients it hopes to reach globally, according to its most recent annual report.Genomic Health’s stock was slightly up Wednesday at $31.43 at the 4 p.m. close of trading on the NASDAQ stock market. Shares of Genomic Health &nbsp;have hovered around $29 since its fourth quarter earnings call last month.',
